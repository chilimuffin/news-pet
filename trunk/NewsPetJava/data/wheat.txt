U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT The U.S. Agriculture Department is notactively considering offering subsidized wheat to the SovietUnion under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDAofficials said.    However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has notbeen ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not inthe very near future.    "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But therejust isn't much talk about it, informally or formally."    Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confidentthan USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to theSoviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offerwhen they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlierthis week.    But administration and private sources agreed that if theReagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat toMoscow, it could take several months.    "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through anyinteragency process," the aide to Lyng said.    "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"said one former USDA official, who noted that theadministration took three months to decide in favor of sellingChina wheat under the subsidy program.    An official representing a large grain trade company saiddeliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members ofCongress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheatsubsidy offer to the Soviets.    But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit toCapitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press thesecretary on the subsidy question a single time.    The administration's interagency trade policy review group,comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked toclear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officialsat the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.    In their talks this week, the two sides discussed theadministration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about anynew initiative. One USDA official who took part in theconsultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm,basic, factual economics."    Another USDA official said there was "not even an informalsuggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to theirpledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they weregranted more favorable terms.    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of anEEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would bedelayed because of disarray within the White House stemmingfrom the Iran arms affair.

INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW Indonesia"s agriculture sector will growby just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pctin 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates ordeclines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.    Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast tofall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report onIndonesia"s agricultural performance.    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in1987.    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mlntonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because ofa drawdown on stocks.    "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not lookpromising as rice production is forecast to decline and theproduction of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or nogain," the report says.    "The modest overall increase which is expected will be dueto significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oiland palm kernels."    Constraints to significant overall increases inagricultural output include a shortage of disease resistantseeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance byfarmers to shift from rice production to other crops, thereport underlines.    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak ofpests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 whichlargely offset gains in yields.    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are nowresistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, moreresistant rice types.    The government is depending on increased production ofexport commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood andpalm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crudeoil prices.    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pctin 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports risingto an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, thereport says.    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) willrise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports willalso rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybeanmeal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of lastSeptember"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a risein domestic demand.    The report said that Indonesia"s overall economicperformance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slightnegative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pctin 1984.    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsiblefor the slump. REUTER

INDONESIAN WHEAT IMPORTS EXPECTED TO FALL IN 1987 Indonesia's wheat imports are expectedto fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln in1986, the U.S. Embassy's annual agriculture report said.    It said the drop was expected, because there will be adrawdown on stocks built up near the end of 1986.    It said wheat stocks at the end of 1986 were 390,000tonnes, up from 223,000 at end-1985.

TRADERS DETAIL FRENCH CEREAL EXPORT REQUESTS French operators last Friday requestedlicences to export 10,500 tonnes of free market maize, 11,950tonnes of free market barley and 13,000 of soft wheat flour tonon-EC countries, at prefixed daily (droit commun) rebates,French trade sources said.    The latest requests for the maize were for export toSwitzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebateprefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20Ecu daily rebate.    The special daily rebate for maize was set in the contextof a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for theexport of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries,in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recentdispute over grain sales to Spain.    If the latest French requests are accepted as expected,this will bring the total of French maize exported in thiscontext to 25,500 tonnes.    The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for thesale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.    Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austriaand Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixedrestitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheatflour were for export to various non-EC countries at anunchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.

U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION All major grain producing countriesmust do their part to help reduce global surpluses and therecent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S.wheat organizations said.    The recent Australian proposals were a good starting pointfor discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feelthey are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on worldgrain trade, the president of the National Association of WheatGrowers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates saidin a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.    Future discussions on international wheat trade shouldinclude three topics -- a commitment to privatization ofgovernment-run export trading entities, a commitment to publicdisclosure of sales and other terms if government entities areinvolved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, thetwo organizations said     While the Australian proposals are welcome the twoorganizations said they are not in total agreement with theirassessments.    Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. targetprices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue toplace the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.farmers, they said.      Other countries, including Australia, have benefittedfrom the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S.acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.    "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- andsubsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stockinggrain and changing programs which protect our growers," JimMiller, president of NAWG said.    "We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among theworld's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks andrestore profitability to agriculture," Miller said. Reuter
USSR WHEAT BONUS RUMORS PERSIST DESPITE DENIALS Grain trade representatives continuedto speculate that the Reagan administration will offersubsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. AgricultureDepartment officials said there was no substance to thereports.    "It's pure fiction," said one senior official at USDA'sForeign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that theadministration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscowin the next two to three weeks.    An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked notto be identified said there was nothing to substantiate thespeculation, which he said was started by "somebody fanning the(wheat) market." Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on thebasis of the speculation.    One lobbyist with close connections to the Reaganadministration said a Soviet trade team told private graintrade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy asmuch as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it beforemid-year, if it was "competitively priced."    Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet tradingorganization, told Reuters he had no information tosubstantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, butsaid that Moscow "would consider" buying U.S. wheat if it wascompetitively priced.    "We don't care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) arelooking for is competitive prices," Ivlev said. "If they (theadministration) are interested in selling it (wheat), theyshould find ways to do it." Reuter
OFFICIAL INQUIRY SET FOR AUSTRALIAN WHEAT INDUSTRY The government's industry aid andprotection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission(IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheatindustry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said.    The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistanceto the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid,he said in a statement.    He said the inquiry will be the first step in settingmarketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when theunderwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat MarketingAct expire.    Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a fullexamination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.    "The inquiry will be required to take into account changeswhich have taken place in the industry as a result of theagricultural policies of major wheat producing countries andthe industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,"he said.    "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry,as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to triggerunderwriting support from the government for the first time," hesaid.    Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of theguaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the AustralianWheat Board near the start of the season.    The IAC's report will be due at the same time as thefindings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage,Handling and Transport, Kerin said.

YUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA There was no evidence of winterkillin Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a linerunning northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S.Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a fieldreport.    The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence ofdelayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fallbecause of dry conditions.    However warm temperatures over the past three weeks havepromoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up onlast fall's late seeding, it said.    Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about thesituation because warm temperatures have brought the grain outof dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, thereport said.    Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damageunder these conditions, they said.

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA The Australian Government will likelyreimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, thedepartment said the sharp fall in world wheat prices hasreduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levelsinsufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated ataround 98 dlrs per tonne.     For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below thebreakeven export price, it said.    Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advancepayment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculatedat 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the currentyear and the two lowest of the previous three years, thedepartment said.    In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling andstorage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.    But the department said the Australian Bureau ofAgricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production willdrop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in1989/90.    The decline will result from low world grain prices leadingto shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.wheat exports, the department said. Reuter
JAPAN CUTTING CHINA CORN COMMITMENTS - USDA Japanese traders have apparentlysharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the nextsix months due to high prices, the U.S. Agriculture Departmentsaid.    In its World Production and Trade Report, the departmentsaid traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwillingto sell at current low world prices.    If the reports are confirmed, China's major exportdestinations such as USSR, Japan, and South Korea, couldincrease purchases of U.S. corn, it said.    China is currently forecast to export 5.5 mln tonnes ofcorn during 1986/87 (Oct-Sept), it said. Reuter
EC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA The European Community, EC, sold75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuingbid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs pertonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latestreport on Export Markets for U.S grains.    EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes inthe 1985/86 season, it said.    The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at atime when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheatimport market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the currentforecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.    The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline indomestic production, and says government plans to lower theguaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrswill contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.    It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier ofthe additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase ofU.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS Chicago Board of trade grain traders andanalysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned tohandle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of newcrop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeansin the futures markets.    Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers willbe more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans becausecorn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That givesdeficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if theysign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thingrather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new cropsoybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans moreattractive under normal circumstances.    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift thelimited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mlnmore oat acres this year than last without being penalized,traders said.    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking ofshifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to themore attractive deal from the government, they added.    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just sixmonths ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South toput soybean land back into cotton.    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybeanproduction in recent years has been a general shift of acres intraditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

FROST NOT EXPECTED TO DAMAGE POLAND'S WHEAT Poland's winter wheat is likely tosurvive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not beknown until late April, the Polish meteorology institute said.    Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can surviveground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C, SpokesmanTeresa Tomaszewska told Reuters.    Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainlymelted in February, air temperatures down to minus 30 C shouldnot be harmful, she said, but added that wheat can still bedamaged by cold spells in March and April, when young shootsmay be exposed to night frosts.

CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES The Canadian Wheat Board has advisedthe federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid tofarmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop yearbeginning August 1, a board spokesman said.    The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommendedprice drops but said it would not be good news for westernCanadian grain growers.    "They're all lower," he said. "This is really gettingpretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survivaland whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."    Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board willrecommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.    Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain isdelivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.    If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, thefarmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. Ifprices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.    The final decision on the initial prices, usually made inApril, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and thefederal cabinet.    Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27pct but last fall the government announced a one billionCanadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.    But federal agricultural officials have already warnedfarmers not to depend on additional government aid this year. Reuter
MORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE Whether the Soviet Union will fulfillits buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreementdepends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade officialtold Reuters.    "How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreementif the United States does not want to offer us grain atcompetitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy traderepresentative of the Soviet Union to the United States.    "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to theUnited States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitiveprices," he said in an interview.    Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up theagreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain atprevailing market prices.    "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said.    Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales ofcommodities under this Agreement will be made at the marketprice prevailing for these products at the time ofpurchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms."    "The United States should supply to the Soviet Uniondefinite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is theUnited States ready to supply this?" he said.    The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand hasbeen met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which heconfirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn pricesremain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.    Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.    "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat,then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to theUnited States to decide how these competitive prices will beoffered," he said.    Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Sovietswas rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer,U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.

AMERICAN FARM BUREAU OPPOSES FARM BILL CHANGES The directors of the American FarmBureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesdayto urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place withoutalterations.    "We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,"said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has beenin place for just a little over a year and in our judgmentthere is more to be gained at the present time from maintainingthe legislation.    "Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farmbill is better on balance than any of the alternatives beingadvanced," Kleckner said.    The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much ashe deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeanscompetitive in the world market.    A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should beeligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIKcertificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel andthe new loan rate.    The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiencypayments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheatbecause of adverse weather. Reuter
UNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER AFFECTS CHINA'S AGRICULTURE Abnormally warm and dry weather over mostparts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China NewsAgency said.    It said the drought has made rice planting difficult ineight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plantdiseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producingareas, it said.    The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi andother provinces have been suffering a drought for more thanseven months.    The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount ofwater stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March,lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectricpower supplies and caused water shortages for industry andconsumers.    The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levelsin a century, causing many ships to run aground and makingharbour manoeuvres difficult, it said.    The drought has also increased the number of forest fires.More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340hectares of forest by mid-February, it said. REUTER

Writing in the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin, DavidRogers of Cargill's Commodity Marketing Division cited agradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months, with a slowrise in wheat prices after recent historic lows.    He said the wheat trade, because wheat can be produced inmany nations, is a good barometer of world grain trade andcould lead to more activity in other grain markets.

HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE A House Agriculture Committee meetinglater today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark adebate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or"de-coupling," provision to cover feedgrains, and those whooppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sourcessaid.    The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winterwheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting andstill receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.    The administration has strongly urged that the bill beexpanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provisionwill emerge from the committee, the sources said.    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are largeestimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimatesby the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at thistime is the major reason cited by those against an expansion ofthe bill, committee staffers said.    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. Aconflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, andstaffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of anexpanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas ofthe country will be underway in the next few weeks and signupfor the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, sosomething has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to beimplemented, an Agriculture Department source said.    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in lastweek's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommitteechairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of theconsequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings wasnecessary.    Major commodity groups, including the National CornGrowers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen'sAssociation, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the billcurrently is not equitable for all grains producers, so itshould be extended to other crops.    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, saidGene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try todecrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in thedebate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introducea bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with theargument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any majorchanges in the farm bill.    "Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of thetiming," a congressional staff member said.    Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have anamendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988feedgrains. Reuter

HOUSE 0/92 PLAN SEEN SCALED-BACK TO 1987 WHEAT Key members of the House Agriculturecommittee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of apending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but abroader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later,Congressional sources said.    The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. GlennEnglish (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to supportan amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm(D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 cropwinter and spring wheat.    This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the originalproposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987wheat only. That provision was later broadened by thesubcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.    Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but stillcollect 92 pct of deficiency payments.    Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponeduntil next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid billand 0/92.    The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot programfollows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influentialfarm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.    Congressional sources said there has not been enough timeto study the implications of a broad 0/92.    "The timing (of the proposal) is off," said one aide to aHouse Agriculture committee member.    However, several Congressional sources said they expect abroader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the HouseAgriculture committee is faced next month with the need to makespending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as partof an overall deficit reduction package.    Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley(D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts mayexceed one billion dlrs.    A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both theCongressional Budget Office and the Reagan administrationestimate it would result in significant budget savings.    A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5billion dlrs over five years.    Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is theapproach of planting season, Congressional sources said.    Some officials said it already is late for implementationof a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 forwheat and feedgrains.    If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up eitherwould have to be extended or reopened, sources said. Reuter

U.S. FEEDGRAIN 0/92 SUPPORTERS EVALUATE POSITION Advocates of a 0/92 plan forfeedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if adisaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee isscaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressionalsources said.    The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English(D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals toimplement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.    An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even thatscaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.    Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains shouldbe treated equally, they said.   If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, thensupporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably notoffer their proposals next week, sources said.   English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. CharlesStenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, butwhether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.    Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's firstchoice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheatfarmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aidfor winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because ofcontroversy over spring wheat, then English might consider aneven greater cutback in the bill, they said.    Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and stillreceive 92 pct of deficiency payments.    Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill toinclude a 0/92 program for feedgrains.    An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farmbill, but to be fair to all crops.    Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers wouldlikely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant aregreater than to idle the land, economists said.    Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it ispremature to make major changes in the farm bill and that theHouse Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely theimpacts of such a program.

USDA ESTIMATES SOVIET WHEAT, COARSE GRAINS The U.S. Agriculture Departmentforecast the Soviet 1986/87 wheat crop at 92.30 mln tonnes, vs92.30 mln tonnes last month. It put the 1985/86 crop at 78.10mln tonnes, vs 78.10 mln tonnes last month.    Soviet 1986/87 coarse grain production is estimated at103.30 mln tonnes, vs 103.30 mln tonnes last month.

USDA RAISES SOVIET GRAIN IMPORT ESTIMATE The U.S. Agriculture Departmentincreased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes.    In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA saidthe increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to theU.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat andcoarse grain from other major suppliers.    USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up onemln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below thepreliminary 1985/86 figure.    Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mlntonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along witha dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and acold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.    USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightlyfrom the previous January's level, while milk productionincreased by nearly six pct.    Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases inroughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestockproduction from expanding as much as it did a year earlier,USDA said. Reuter

MARKET DISCOUNTS HIGHER SOVIET GRAIN IMPORTS Grain analysts said the increase ofthree mln tonnes in 1986/87 Soviet grain imports is unlikely toaffect the market Tuesday.    They said the market already has discounted higher Sovietimports, partly on news last month that the Soviet Union boughtone mln tonnes of U.S. corn, and on rumors that the Reaganadministration is pushing for authority to sell the SovietsU.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.    In its supply-demand report, the USDA raised its estimatefor 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln.    "That was business already done, for all practicalpurposes," said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson,reflecting similar statements made by other analysts. Reuter
USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT The Soviet Union will likely honorits commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of fourmln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Departmentofficial said.    "They have always honoured the agreement, and there's noreason now to think they won't this year," he told Reuters.    "They have an aggressive buying campaign from the EuropeanCommunity, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyersfrom all sources at this point," the official said inexplaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain importsestimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.    This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago whenanalysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn forthe first time in 15 years.    A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concernover Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S.corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow'srecent interest.    Lower corn production prospects in some major supplyingcountries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan,and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, theofficial said.    "The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists"and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. "Assoon as they need corn, they'll buy it," he added.    USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to theSoviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said thepurchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.    The USDA official would not speculate on when the Sovietswould enter the U.S. market again.    "There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from thesituation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one offrenetic buying now," the official said.    However, the situation in wheat is "a different story," hesaid. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchasecommitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Sovietpurchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.    Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S.is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer tothe Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation. Reuter

AWB SAYS AUSTRALIAN WHEAT SALES OVER 10 MLN TONNES The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB)1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnesalready sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said.    "We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne exporttarget for the year," he said in a statement.    He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWBspokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, theSoviet Union and Iraq.    In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWBexported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.    Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest hasended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes deliveredto the AWB.    The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct ofreceivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said.    However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain wasstill being held on farms and further milling and feed wheatmay be delivered following the recent announcement of the finalGuaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said.    Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's FebruaryWheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes.    But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate couldturn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and thefinal crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes.The official estimate is not yet available.    In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes ofthe 16.13 mln tonne crop.

LYNG SAYS NO DECISION ON SOVIET EEP OFFER U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said the Reagan administration had not decided on offeringthe Soviet Union subsidized wheat but that such an offer hadnot been ruled out.    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said that he had noknowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within thecabinet.    Asked if the administration had ruled out offering tosubsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Union under thedepartment's export enhancement program, Lyng said, "No. Wehaven't made a decision on it, haven't even talked about it,haven't even looked at it."    Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buyU.S. wheat if competitively priced, Lyng responded, "If they(the Soviets) would offer to buy some wheat, would we acceptit? It would depend on what price they offered."    Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheatwas far off the world price.    Asked about persistent speculation that the administrationwould offer Moscow a wheat subsidy, Lyng said, "Some peoplethink they're doing it to see if they can get a little spurt inthe market."

U.S.-SOVIET GRAIN ACCORD QUESTIONED BY LYNG U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he was not sure a long-term U.S.-Soviet grainagreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.    "It hasn't been worth much in the last two years....Theyhaven't lived up to the agreement as I see it," Lyng said in aninterview with Reuters.    "It would be my thought that it's not worth any effort towork out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement tobe a one-sided thing," he said.    However, Lyng said he did not want to make a "definitivecommitment one way or another at this point."    Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed tobuy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mlntonnes each of corn and wheat.    Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes ofwheat during the third agreement year, which ended lastSeptember, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.    Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscowwould buy this year.    "I've seen people making comments on that and I don't knowhow they know, unless they talk to the Soviets," he said. "I haveno knowledge, and I really don't think anyone other than theSoviets have any knowledge."

GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0/92 FARM PLAN Implementation of a one-year 0/92pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promotedtoday by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommitteeas a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmersanother option when making their planting decisions.    "We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame,but we are locked into this," said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains. "We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt thefarmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both."    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 billfor 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickmansaid that it will probably be introduced next week.    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer toforego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiencypayment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided underthe current bill.    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meetbudget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better thansharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply adifferent type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from governmentpayments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at thispoint, he said.    "I don't think there is any interest in pursuing adecoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal," Glickman saidat the hearing.    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of theBoren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. Hisplan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment toparticipating farmers, require that idled acreage be put toconservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extraidled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acresin a county and provide tenant protection provisions.    "I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, butwe can at least move in that direction," Boschwitz said.    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testifiedin favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current biasin U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'dependency on the government, he said.    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnsonsaid, and would still encourage farmers to plant.    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association andthe National Cattlemen's Association said their groups opposeany 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening thefarm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.    But when asked if his association were forced to choosebetween a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, LarryJohnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

U.S. MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE-BOSCHWITZ A marketing loan for U.S. wheat,feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplusproduction situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. RudyBoschwitz (R-Minn.) said.    "I think I would not support a marketing loan now," he toldthe House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans andfeedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of amarketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focusedsupport on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.    A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage moreproduction, especially in high-yielding areas, would be muchmore expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loansand not increase exports significantly, he said.

AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92 A 0/92 program would have verylittle impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle onlyan additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, accordingto a report from the Agriculture Department.    The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acresidled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mlndlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.    The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.    "The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause verylarge acreages to be removed from crop production is quitesmall," the report said.    "The returns on typical farms still favor participation inthe usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permittedacreage," the USDA report said.    The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to foregoplanting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,would be most used by producers in high production/high riskareas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,director of USDA's economics analysis staff.    "In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that muchparticipation," Collins said.    USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheatwould be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.    Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushelsof sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales ofcotton, the report said.    "In determining whether to participate, a producer wouldneed to weigh the expected cash costs of production against theloan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above theexpected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must beconsidered," according to the analysis.    "What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference betweenthe loan rate and the cost of production," Collins said.    For producers with low production costs, that difference isgreater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go alongwith 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be moreattractive.    Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would bemore incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.    "I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal atfirst, but it is a step towards the goal of separatingproduction decisions from government payments," Collins said.    In a speech earlier today before the National Grains andFeed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is toolate to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup willbe over by the end of this month.

SENS. DANFORTH, BOND ASK TARGETED 0/92 MEASURE Missouri Republican Senators JohnDanforth and Christopher Bond have introduced a bill that wouldallow wheat and feedgrain producers along the Mississippi andMissouri Rivers hurt by flooding last year to collect at least92 pct of their deficiency payments this year without planting.    Danforth aide Austin Schlick said the bill was similar to aprovision included in a House Agriculture Committee-passedemergency disaster assistance bill scheduled to be taken up bythe House tomorrow.

NEW EEP DURUM WHEAT OFFER TO ALGERIA -- USDA U.S. exporters will have theopportunity to sell an additional 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durumwheat to Algeria under the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, theU.S. Agriculture Department said.    The department said the sales will be subsidized withcommodities from the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC,inventory and the subsidy will enable U.S. exports to competeat commercial prices in the Algerian market.    Algeria has already purchased 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durumwheat under a previous export enhancement initiative announcedNovember 10, 1986, it said.    Details of the latest initiative, including an invitationfor offers from exporters, will be issued in the near future,the department said. Reuter
KANSAS LEGISLATOR TO OFFER U.S. 0/92 BILL TODAY U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.,chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat,soybeans and feedgrains, said he would today introduce a billto apply the so-called 0/92 concept to wheat and feedgrainsproducers.    Glickman told Reuters the measure would allow 1987 winterwheat producers and 1988 feedgrains producers the possibilityof receiving no less than 92 pct of their income supportpayments regardless of how much acreage they planted.    He also said his bill would protect program participantsfrom reduced income payments in the event market prices roseabove the loan rate. Reuter
U.S. HOUSE TARGETING PROPOSAL SPARKS INTEREST A proposal by two U.S. HouseDemocrats to target government farm benefits to small- andmedium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on aHouse subcommittee today.    "On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen," saidRep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House AgricultureSubcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. "This is thefirst hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternativeto the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal."    The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and ByronDorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrsper bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receivedeficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but notmore than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.    The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons notactively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.    Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over fiveyears, protect family farms and eliminate governmentaccumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would behalted.    However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who afamily farmer is."    Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict programpayments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.    Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the billwould determine if a person was actively engaged in farming andtherefore eligible for payments. Reuter

CHINA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA Light, scattered showers coveredwinter wheat areas in the North China Plain in the week endedMarch 14, moistening topsoils for wheat, just breaking dormancyin most central and northern areas, the Joint AgriculturalWeather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and CommerceDepartments said.    In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agencysaid southern winter wheat areas are in the early vegetativestage. Above-normal February temperatures over the North ChinaPlain caused winter grains to break dormancy early in thesouth.     Moderate to heavy rains in southern Jiangsu, Anhui,eastern Hebei, Hunan , Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zheziang, reversedFebruary's below normal precipitation pattern.    The agency said the wet weather in these areas providedample moisture for rice planting and lessened the need forirrigation.     Mostly dry weather in early-rice areas of Guanxi andGuandong resulted in irrigation for continued rice planting, itsaid. Reuter
LYNG TO MEET WITH EXPORTERS, EEP LIKELY TOPIC Secretary of Agriculture RichardLyng will meet with representatives from major grain exportingcompanies today, and the subject of subsidized wheat to theSoviet Union will likely be discussed, an aide to Lyng said.    Today's meeting, set to begin at 1500 EST (2000 gmt), wasscheduled at the request of the exporters, the aide said.    "The EEP (export enhancement program) is pretty obviouslyone of the things they (the exporters) want to talk about, butthey haven't any agenda as far as I know," Lyng's aide said.    Private industry export officials have met periodicallywith Lyng to discuss farm policies and the export situation.Whether this meeting will prompt any U.S. action on the issueof whether Moscow will be offered export bonus wheat isuncertain, the aide said.    "I don't know what they'll tell us that we don't alreadyknwo, but we'll hear what they have to say," Lyng's aide said.

WORLD CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA Dry weather covered most Europeancrop areas in the week ended March 14, except for those insouthwestern France, southern Italy, and Greece, the JointAgricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture andCommerce Departments said.    In its International Weather and Crop sumary, the agencysaid mixed rain and snow covered Greece.    Winter grains in England, France, and northern Italyremained dormant. Grains usuaually break dormancy in March.    Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy inearly April, it said.    Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areasof northern Pakistan and northern India, it said.    Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in centralIndia and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas bylate April.    Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India,reversing February's below-normal trend.    Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in mostsouthern areas, it said.    In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to thecentral islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzonand southern Mindanao.    Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia asrainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands.    In February locally heavy showers may have caused floodingin Java, it said.    The second cnsecutive week of dry weather stressed Moroccanwinter grains, approaching teh heading stage, the agency said.    Light to moderate rain spread from northern Thailand toNorthern Vietnam as dry weather prevailed elsewhere inSoutheast Asia.    Dry weather covered winter grain areas in western andcentral Algeria, but soil moisture was likely adequate to meetcrop demands, it said.    Light showers in eastern Algeria and Tunisia maintainedadequate moisture for crop growth, it said.    Timely rains will be needed in the next several weeks aswinter grains advance through the critical reproductive phase,the agency said. Reuter
U.S. HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0/92 DISASTER PROGRAM The House of Representativesapproved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrainsfarmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive atleast 92 pct of their federal income support payments even ifthey did not plant.    The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmersin Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passedby a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.    Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S.Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.    USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buyingcrop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposedbroad-scale revision of farm programs.    The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented fromplanting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of thedeficiency payments they would have received.    To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant adifferent crop on that land this spring, although they coulduse the land for grazing or to plant hay.    USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs,largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.    The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producersalong the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were preventedfrom planting crops this year because of residual damage fromlast fall's flooding.    In addition, the measure would require USDA to make fullpayment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approvedby Congress last fall.    Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrsin appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in theregion 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.    The administration said it opposed the bill because, byexpanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwartefforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as analternative to federal disaster assistance.    USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill werenarrower than the administration's proposal to offer the optionto all major commodities and would produce insignificantsavings.    USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmerswould produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while therequirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers wouldcost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated byCongress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mlndlrs.    USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mlndlrs.    In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.    But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option towheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceilingon the disaster assistance program. Reuter

CONGRESSMAN URGES WHEAT EEP TO SOVIET UNION Kansas Republican Congressman PatRoberts urged the Reagan administration to offer exportenhancement program, eep, subsidies to the Soviet Union.    Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee,Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, andshould also include the Soviet Union.    Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issueof an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reaganadministration recently because Secretary of State GeorgeShultz was out of the country.    "That very well may be the case," said Tom Kay, U.S.Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Serviceadministrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his replyto Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge.    Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of theUSDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow.    "I'd be delighted to deliver the message," Kay replied.    Earlier, Kay had repeated Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng's statement last week that "the door is not yet closed onan eep to the Soviet Union." Reuter
LYNG SAID TO HAVE NO COMMENT ON USSR WHEAT EEP U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng told representatives of several of the largest grainexporting firms and two farm organizations that he was not in aposition to comment on their request that the Reaganadministration offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union,according to participants in today's meeting.    "He (Lyng) simply told us he was not in any position to talkabout an EEP (export enhancement program) initiative to theSoviet Union," said Glen Hofer, vice president of the NationalCouncil of Farmer Cooperatives.    Another participant in the meeting, who asked not to beidentified, said Lyng was "unresponsive" to the group's request.    Participants in the meeting included Cargill Inc,Continental Grain Co, Louis Dreyfus Corp, Union EquityCooperative Exchange, the National Association of WheatGrowers, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, amongothers, participants said.    Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers and UnderSecretary Daniel Amstutz also attended the 30-minute meeting.    Hofer described Lyng as "sympathetic but noncommittal," andsaid he thought he detected "a sense of frustration" on Lyng'spart at not being able to respond more positively to thegroup's urging.    A grain industry representative said some participants were"puzzled" by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before thecabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.    "There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to theidea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been,"this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referringto an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.    This official said there was not a significant amount ofpressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEPoffer to Moscow.    Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman PatrickLeahy (D-Vt.) had written two letters to Lyng urging such anoffer, this official said Lyng had received virtually no phonecalls from lawmakers on the subject.    But Hofer said other important matters at the White House,rather than an absence of political pressure, might haverestrained Lyng. Reuter

HOUSE FARM LEADER SEES BILLION DLR BUDGET CUTS The 1988 agriculture budget willhave to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, thechairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.    Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of theuse of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms arepossibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending,said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculturesubcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.    Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain andFeed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from theHouse budget committee that the agriculture committee will haveto reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billiondlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.    Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to bemade very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988budget, Glickman added.    Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.    "The administration's target price proposals are dead inthe water," he said.    To cut the budget, Glickman said, "everthing is on thetable," except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.    Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committeewill study in order to cut farm spending.    Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which hesaid would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.    Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or "pik')certificates will also be another option his committee willstudy, Glickman said.    While not committing himself for or against such action, hesaid lawmakers have to examine recent government findings whichindicate certificates cost more than cash payments.    Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms andtightening up of the person definition for annual paymentlimitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.    He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements byfive pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a movethat could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he wouldnot be in favor of such a change.    Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's,EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly beingused up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expandthis program while making cuts in other areas.    Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.    "I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the choppingblock," Glickman said. Reuter

SHULTZ SAYS U.S. PRODUCTS MUST BE COMPETITIVE Asked what the U.S. StateDepartment's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow,Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leadersthat U.S. products must be competitive in the world market.    "If we are going to sell our products, whatever they maybe, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market,"Shultz told the board of directors for the National Associationof Wheat Growers.    "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say thatsomebody is going to buy your product if they can get the samething at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't," hesaid.    "That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets,and it must be our approach as we look at the American farmprogram and try to figure out what we should do to make itbetter," Shultz told the Wheat Growers.    Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation thatwould allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than theAmerican housewife, he realizes the importance of Americanagricultural products being competitively priced.    Speculation has been in the market for some time that theUnited States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Unionat subsidized prices.    Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if itwere competitively priced. Agriculture Department officialshave declined to take any official position on the issue. Reuter

OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED The results of a controversial studyof farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has thehighest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairyfarmers benefit more than any other commodity producers fromsubsidies.    Results of the study, which has not been released by OECDbecause of objections from some countries, were provided toReuters by officials of several countries on condition they notbe identified.    The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies forthe years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producersubsidy equivalent, PSE.    The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE, or theamount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the European Community at 68.8 pctand the United States 48.2 pct.    For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 andthe U.S. 17.2. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.    In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pctcompared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.Japan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the ECand 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.    For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in theEC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.    The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrialcountries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in mostcases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC andJapan, the sources said.    Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developingcountry producers of commodities, were not included in the OECDwork.    Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries torelease the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECDministerial meeting in Paris during May.    Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global tradetalks now underway in Geneva.    British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visitto Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a startingpoint for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.    He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiatedown domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause ofthe present crisis in world agriculture.    However, the OECD study results are controversial becausethey highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officialsfamiliar with the study said.    The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Servicerecently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt toverify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.    In some cases the results were substantially different thanthe OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. andelsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD baseperiod of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.    For example, the USDA study found the United Statessubsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.    French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, toldreporters last week that the United States subsidizes itsfarmers more than the EC.    However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probablyhigher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.    Officials of several countries have been asked tocontribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of thecurrent world farm situation.    The updated calculations, which may take several months tocomplete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictiveimport quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.    U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farmbill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments tograin farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officialsadded. Reuter

SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS Secretary of State George Shultz hasdecided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to theSoviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sellsubsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and theAgriculture Department, a State Department official said.    "Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidylast summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's nowbasically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to whatthey want to do," the official said.    If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to theSoviet Union, he said, "Shultz will not wage a vigorouscampaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, buthe won't go to the President and voice his objections."    In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarksyesterday to leaders of the National Association of WheatGrowers, the State Department said, "Secretary Shultz expressedhis belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should becompetitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.    The Agriculture Department is in the best position todetermine whether consideration should be given at this time toextending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export EnhancementProgram."    Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to theSoviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer toMoscow, the State Department official said.    "Everyone in the government agrees that if there is asubsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had afirm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy."    USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when theUSSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidizedwheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.    The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the groundsthat the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bringU.S. prices down to competitive levels.    The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, theState Department source said.    "What the Soviets want is something equivalent to thelowest price being paid by anyone in the world," he said.    The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of theU.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS Three geographically diverse droughtsin Asia are being linked by some scientists to areintensification of the complex and little-understood El Ninoweather pattern, <Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weatherforecasting service, said.    Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcanegrowers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all faceserious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrivein time to break the droughts, offical reports, governmentofficials and meteorologists said.    Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, saidthe drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinceshave been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.    Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.    Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuanwas 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure forover 20 years, the paper said.    The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pctcompared with last March and lowered the water levels of manyrivers, it added.    This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causingshortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of theYangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing manyships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.    Unusually high temperatures have also been reported acrossChina, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan hasrecorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than averagesince early February.    The New China News Agency said the average Decembertemperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higherthan last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.    Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lankaand threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry ofPlantation Industries officials told Reuters    In Australia, concern is growing about below-averagerainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along theQueensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, localMeteorological Bureau officials said.    For many farmers and government officials the fear is thatwhile the present low rainfall does not yet pose a majorthreat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when thewheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.    Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 droughtwhich devastated the wheat crop and coincided with theoccurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known asEl Nino, they said.    Although meteorologists are cautious about linking theAsia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any singlecause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.    Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data foragriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event'was unique.    The El Nino does not always produce the same effects andthe present occurrence is much less pronounced than the lastmajor event in 1982/83, it said.    El Nino, Spanish for "Christ Child" because it appears aroundChristmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing cloudsand rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coastof Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated withthe Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the tradewinds, meteorologists said.    The winds, strengthened by El Nino's "pump" effect, raise thesea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.    When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sendsa surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where itcollides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.    One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect therain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into thePacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.    The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weathersaid.    China, where the affected areas have received between 40and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for theMay-September rains, it said.    The May-September rains normally provide thedrought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.    In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip havereceived less than half the normal rainfall during the currentwet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishingas the rainy season draws to an end.    In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should beat its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usuallyoccur between April and June, although it is not possible atthis stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual. REUTER
ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER The Soviet Union's winter graincrop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry plantingconditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst ofworld weather and crop conditions said.    Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of theEF Hutton publication "Global Crop News," said in her latestreport that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat,from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.    "Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Sovietwinter grain crop) is far more pessimistic," she said. "Butit's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lotwill depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of thetroubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting."    Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probablyprevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheatgrowing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasusreceived on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.    The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke recordlows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken itstoll on Soviet winter crops, she said.    However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt hadample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majorityof crop areas from severe frost damage.    The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grainsin the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily fromCanada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,Martell said.    She cited a number of reasons besides possible cropproblems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.    Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing onmoisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weathernecessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.    Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobylaccident may have contaminated more grain than originallythought and have to be made up with imports.    However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of lastresort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have onlyjust recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.    Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to theUSSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.    In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grainimports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Unionbought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only24 pct of that total.    While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised theirestimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said. Reuter

AUSTRALIAN WHEAT AREA TO FALL, FORECASTER SAYS Australian wheat plantings areforecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF)said in its first preliminary crop forecast.    But there was no reason to expect Australian production in1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year,the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales andQueensland suffered from poor yields last season.    Most of the fall in plantings was expected in WesternAustralia while state average yields would be assisted bygrowers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said.    The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was apoor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. Butin the eastern states the wheat area should hold up providedthat rainfall between now and June is not less than average,AWF said.    Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut backwheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since theyneeded cash flow and there were problems with alternativecrops.    "The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses andoats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise ahigh proportion of growers' income," AWF said.    AWF's state area forecasts in mln hectares, with 1986/87production in mln tonnes, are as follows (crop forecasts werenot given for the new wheat year)                   Area         Crop             1987/88  1986/87  1986/87 Queensland    0.82     0.82     0.95 N.S.W.        3.07     3.17     4.40 Victoria      1.53     1.63     3.25 S.Australia   1.45     1.64     2.30 W.Australia   3.53     4.46     5.60 REUTER
MARKET LOAN COULD BE PINNED TO U.S. TRADE BILL Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., saidhe was considering amending the Senate Finance Committee'strade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan forsoybeans, corn and wheat.    Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there wasgreat reluctance among members of the Senate AgricultureCommittee to reopen the 1985 farm bill, and that a marketingloan might have a better chance in the Finance panel.    The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which ineffect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at theworld price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in U.S. cottonexports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports.    Pryor serves on both the Senate Finance and AgricultureCommittees. Reuter
U.S. FARM POLICY DEBATE COULD HIT SENATE SOON The Senate this week might take upproposed legislation that could serve as a lightning rod toexpose broad initiatives to change U.S. farm policy.    The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that wouldallow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pctof their income support payments if flooding last yearprevented, or will prevent, them from planting their 1987crops, Senate staff members told Reuters.    Also pending is a bill extend the life of the NationalCommission on Dairy Policy.    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., intends to offer an amendmentto one of the bills that would suspend the minimum plantingrequirement for all 1987 wheat, feedgrain, cotton and riceproducers, an aide said.    Under current law, producers must plant at least 50 pct oftheir base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of theirdeficiency payments.    Most major U.S. farm groups have lobbied hard againstmaking any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out offear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems tobudget-cutting pressures.    Representatives of these farm groups have said they alsofear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on abill that would require large acreage set-asides in return forsharply higher support prices.

IWC LIFTS WORLD GRAIN OUTPUT ESTIMATE TO RECORD The International Wheat Council (IWC)lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grainproduction by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, comparedwith 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.    In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leavingunchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against arecord 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.    The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat andcoarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mlnagainst 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mlnrise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.    The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 islikely to be down from last year as low world prices andrestrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.    At least four of the five major exporters expect to see adrop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. Thereis still potential for even higher average wheat yields but theIWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.    Although it is still early to assess the coarse grainoutlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in theEuropean Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area isexpected lower but oat sowings could rise.    After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Unionplans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mlnhectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields arelikely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improvedweather and a further increase in the use of intensivecultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Sovietmaize output in 1987, the IWC said.    Any reduction in world coarse grain output would bebolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWCsaid.    It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks atendof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mlntonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.    After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mlntonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs ofanother large crop this coming season with higher outputexpected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED Efforts by governments to control wheatsurpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partialsuccess, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in itslatest monthly report.    Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducingboth price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWCsays in a survey of support prices in the five main wheatexporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.    In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for exportincome, there may be problems in reducing production.    A policy of cutting wheat production could lead tounemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could thenlead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.    The IWC outlines three courses of action open togovernments in wheat exporting countries.    They could continue to support prices in the hope that whenthe world economy improves demand for wheat will rise andsurpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.    Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat whichcould be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a longperiod.    This option may prove to be the most politicallyunattractive and would result in many producers abandoningwheat production, the report said.    The third option would be for governments to distinguishbetween the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,possibly varying support prices according to farm size oroverall production.    The IWC review covers support prices in the major exportingcountries since 1982. At some time during that period all theproducers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.    These changes did not always result in lower exportsubsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations morethan offset lower prices in the domestic currency.    For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC interventionprice for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 Europeancurrency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in whichmost export transactions are denominated, the interventionprice however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost ofsupporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequersand some governments are now searching for ways to cutexpenditure, the report says.    The proportion of world wheat output produced by the fivemajor exporters declined in the period covered by the surveyfrom 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due toincreased production in China and India.    The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this wascountered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by loweracreages.    In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 percent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch toother enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP India is searching for non-communistcountertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit andconserve foreign exchange.    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering andelectronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, areall on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State TradingCorp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).    "The two state trading corporations are free to use theirbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indianexports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding thatprivate firms are excluded from countertrading.    One trade source said India has targetted countries thatdepend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreignimports.    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small partof India's total trading and are likely to account for lessthan eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in tradeduring the nine months ended December, the sources said.    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the EasternBloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps ofagricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crudeoil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,against three billion in 1985/86.    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to helpnarrow the country's large trade deficit, is stillinsignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billionin the current fiscal year.    But the push to include non-communist countries incountertrade is also due to other factors, including the slowgrowth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promotingcountertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were madediscreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannotofficially support bartering.    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron oreexports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.    "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause thatpreference will be given to parties who accept payment in kindfor goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,adding that the policy remains flexible.    "We also take into account other factors such as prices atwhich the goods and services are offered to India," the tradeofficial said.    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreigncompanies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigsand railway equipment to India that they stood a better chanceif they bought Indian goods or services in return, the tradesources said.    Illustrating the point, the official said a South Koreanfirm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mlndlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.    In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buyIndian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pctsought by New Delhi, the trade official said.    "We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,"he added.    Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreigncurrency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol tobuy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe inexchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.    But despite India's new drive, countertrade has someinherent problems, they added.    "It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement thatthe trade should always be balanced," one trade source said. "Theother problem is it is often difficult to supply or buycommodities which the other party wants."    Another added, "Barter is also restrictive. We look upon itas a temporary measure to get over the current balance ofpayments difficulty.    "This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy." REUTER

DROUGHT CUTS CHINESE WHEAT CROP -- USDA REPORT Drought has resulted in a reductionin China's estimated wheat crop this year to 87.0 mln tonnes,2.0 mln below last year's harvest, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's officer in Peking said in a field report.    The report, dated March 25, said imports in the 1987/88season are projected at 8.0 mln tonnes, 1.0 mln tonnes abovethe the current season's estimate.    Imports from the United States are estimated at 1.5 mlntonnes compared to only 150,000 tonnes estimated for the1986/87 year, it said.    After travelling to major wheat producing areas andobtaining more information on the planted area, the totalplanted area was estimated down 290,000 hectares due to the dryfall, it said.    The report said to compensate for the below normalprecipitation irrigation has increased as has the use offertilizer.    While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible,most of the wheat crop has access to some water and thereforehas emerged from dormancy and is doing well, the report said.    It said scattered rain in many parts of China in the past10 days has improved the situation but information on haildamage in Anhui is incomplete. Reuter

COLD AIR A THREAT TO SOME U.S. HARD WHEAT AREAS A cold air mass working its waysouth from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard redwinter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheatspecialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.    "There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough alongso that it's probably vulnerable," Krenzler said.    Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air movingfrom the north could put temperatures in the middle 20'sfahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of alow pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall thesystem.    If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hitOklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperaturescould stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.    Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crophas advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the morevulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.    "We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26degrees (fahrenheit)," Krenzler said, "as long as we don't havea lot of wind."    "If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say wehave a good chance of significant damage to the heads," hesaid.    Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central andsouthwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable.Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developedand have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.

SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countriesfor emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by thecountry's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.    Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aidneeded for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.    The letter said the government had to step in "to avertserious economic hardship" and because the Social ServicesMinistry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provisionof 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.    The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a sixmonth period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice cropwas harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour andother cereals were required, it said, along with supplies ofsugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.    In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha(October 1986-April 1987) crop had been "almost completelydevastated," the letter said. Maha paddy output was nowestimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originallyexpected.    There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a highforecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequaterainfall within the next three to four weeks.    "Should the present drought continue, however, production isestimated at around 20 mln bushels," the letter added.    Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Lastyear's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.    The letter said villagers in most seriously affecteddistricts had been deprived of any means of subsistence becausesubsidiary crops had also failed.    It said the government's current budget did not permit itto provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected."Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodityprices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continueto exert pressure on the expenditure side."    The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees permonth for each family, as well as handling, transport anddistribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds bythe government would not be possible without seriouslyimpairing development projects, or "greatly fuelling inflation"in the economy, the letter said.    The letter said the Food Department would be able torelease wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet theimmediate cereal requirements "provided such stocks are replacedsubsequently."    The Meteorological Department said the country wasexperiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-monthdry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break whenthe monsoon rains fell in late May.    The letter said some areas had been experiencing thedrought since August, and in the rice growing district ofKurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June1986. Reuter

COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET Consuming countries, chastened by thecollapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price supportoperations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before thatcommodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they areserving, a Reuter survey showed.    They want price ranges to be more responsive to markettrends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining theaccords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoidthe risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.    Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned ageneralised approach to commodity price stabilisation andprefer to assess each commodity case by case, the surveyshowed.    The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week setprecise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could dounder the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchaselimits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures marketsand stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct oftotal buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. Thiswill help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, theworld's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.    The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the BufferStock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.    A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) wasadopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exportingcountries agreed several changes to make the reference pricemore responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisionsunder which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to financeoperations. Direct cash contributions from members will fundbuffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular featureof the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses runninginto hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.    Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiationsin London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist thatagreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.    Consumers and a small group of producers argued that"objective criteria" should be used to define export quotashares, which would have meant a reduction in the share ofBrazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintainits previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,delegates and trade sources see chances of any near termnegotiations on export quota distribution as remote.    International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. Thesedo not have any economic clauses but provide a forum fordiscussions on possible future economic agreements, collectstatistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts saiddifferences between sugar exporting countries have held up anyprogress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheercompetition between major exporters amid a world grain glutmilitate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.    An alternative focus for commodity discussions areinternational study groups, made up of governments with advicefrom industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.    The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planneddirectly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed tobecome operational because neither the U.S. Nor the SovietUnion has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said theU.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,citing the lack of widespread support.    U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials inKuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commoditypact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing tostudy individual cases for economically sound, market-orientedcommodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.    "We see little to be gained by attempting to increase theprice of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,"official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currentlybelongs to only two international commodity agreements thathave economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement(ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheatpacts.    The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreementbecause it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic andnot designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRAas the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.    U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other membersof the pact to agree that the price review and adjustmentmechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflectmarket trends and also to continue the accord as a marketoriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.    Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they haveconsistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts onthe merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries MinisterLim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, theworld's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides itsparticipation in international commodity pacts case by case.    Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin ProducingCountries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPClaunched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnesfor a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from70,000.    Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture anddelegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron toldReuters in London, "Agreements with economic clauses tostabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges wereclose to market reality, if there was full participation byproducers and consumers, and if participants were prepared totake their obligations in the framework of the agreementseriously."    But Baron added, "No real sanctions are available for acountry that doesn't stick to its obligations...The Germanapproach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the bestinstrument to help developing countries. They were never meantto be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is howdeveloping countries often interpret them."    Traditionally Britain has always been supportive ofcommodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with ThirdWorld producing countries. But recently demands for morestringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on theneed for "intellectual honesty" and "objective criteria" havegrown.    British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to bea two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.    It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving directmarket participation through a buffer stock have a high degreeof transparency and do not contain the risk of open-endedborrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices toreflect changes in market structure and price trends ratherthan dictate what prices should be.    A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges pricerealism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.    A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourableto commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer ofsugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the realmarket situation, particularly regarding stocks.    Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja toldReuters in Jakarta: "These agreements can work as long as theproblems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there arestructural problems..But we are still committed to commodityagreements as an act of faith." Nicaraguan External TradeMinister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producerscannot afford not to give their backing to commodityagreements.    "The political will is not there on the part of someconsumers to make agreements work," Martinez Cuenca said.    The head of the economics department in the BrazilianForeign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters anagreement can be successful if it keeps a link with marketreality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a systemof quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pactand actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman GrahamShanley said consuming countries realise steady export earningsenhance developing countries' ability to service debt and meangreater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.

KANSAS EXCHANGE HITS CFTC POSITION LIMIT PLAN The Kansas City Board of Trade,KCBT, has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposalto raise the Chicago Board of Trade's, CBT, speculativeposition limits on wheat futures contracts, saying the planwould put the the Kansas exchange "at a serious competitivedisadvantage."    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last monthproposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900contracts for any single month from 600 contracts.    At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheatspeculative position limits unchanged.    "Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat wouldsignificantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBTfor speculative interest," Michael Braude, president of theKansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC.    A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account openinterest affected by existing speculative limits in proposingto raise CBT's limits.    KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedgingefficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and ofthe exchange's wheat options contract and impair its ability toattract large speculators.

WEATHER HURTING YUGOSLAV WHEAT - USDA REPORT Unfavorable late winter weatherconditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslaviaindicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop,the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said.    The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade toSubotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crophad been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spellthat followed a period of warm weather.    He said unseasonably warm weather in late February thatbrought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early wasfollowed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.    Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of whichshow stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leafand possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.    The report said that since much of the early growth inFebruary was from late seeding rather than from normaldevelopment, his view was that the damage may be more extensivethan some local observers say.    The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fieldson normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin andchances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.    However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorableand many of the fields had already been top-dressed, whichwould aid recovery. Reuter

WINTER WEATHER HURTS EAST GERMAN GRAIN - USDA Shifts from mild to very coldweather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sownwinter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, theU.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said.    In a field report, the officer said indications were thatwinter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares comparedwith 38,000 last year.    He said the damage was probably more limited in southernand central regions and most widespread in the north.    Damage was most severe on plants above the ground wherelittle or no snow cover was present, he added.    The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshineduring the day led to some heaving, particularly for welldeveloped plants and for winter barley.    Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standingwater occurred in the fields.    The officer said repairing damage will probably call forspecial measures this spring in fields with damaged plants andwhere stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timedapplications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added. Reuter

SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER Speculation the United States willoffer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to havereached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary ofState George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheatmarkets since officials from the two countries held theircustomary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow'sdecision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn marketstrengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand inthe way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export EnhancementProgram, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit toMoscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representativeshere as a clear signal that the Reagan administration waspreparing an offer.    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lippedabout the prospects of a subsidy offer.    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned thecontention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,while not a "done deal," is a live possibility.    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whomasked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that anoffer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,are saying they would not rule one out.    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as topredict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten daysto two weeks.    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaderswho had been in contact with administration officials.    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancementoffer would be made by the middle of this month.    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would endup being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier thisyear when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrsper tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheatsubsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases ofU.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat dealwould appear to be price.    Last summer the administration took the controversial stepof offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but wereembarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the groundsthat the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat pricesfar above world market prices.    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level upfront instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be ameans of controlling the price while attempting to dampencriticism, grain trade sources said.    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultzfrom saying the Soviets were "chortling" because Washington wasoffering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available toU.S. housewives.    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representativeshere is that a general warming of relations between the twocountries since last summer, combined with continued hard timesin the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would considerbuying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstancessurrounding the administration's announcement of the wheatsubsidy offer last summer.    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional andindustry leaders were led to believe the White House haddecided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include notonly the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer toinclude only the Soviets.    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure ofuncertainty even to the predictions of those most convincedthat the administration will not now pass up the opportunity tosell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

U.S. FARM REORGANIZATIONS PROVING COSTLY - GAO U.S. farmers who reorganize theiroperations to circumvent a cap on federal payments could add2.3 billion dlrs to the cost of the government's agriculturalprograms by 1989, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said.    "We estimate that should the trend in farm reorganizationscontinue, reorganizations since 1984 could be adding almost 900mln dlrs annually to program costs by 1989," GAO SeniorAssociate Director Brian Crowley said.    "Cumulative costs for the six-year period, 1984 to 1989,could approach 2.3 billion dlrs," he said.    Between 1984 and 1986, reorganizations added almost 9,000new persons to U.S. Agriculture Department payment rolls,Crowley told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat,Soybeans and Feedgrains.

ANALYSTS SAY USSR MAY PREFER NEW CROP U.S. WHEAT The Soviet Union would likely be moreinterested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking anygrain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S.wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said.    Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchasesuntil the condition of winter and spring crops is better knownmake new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman,director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.    "Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offereda subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respondto," Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusinesseducation conference here. But if there are too manyconstraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take lessthan an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said.    Hoffman said Pillsbury's internal statistics put SovietUnion wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidyoffer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels,Moscow would likely buy more, he said.    "If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, Iexpect they'll take it," said Vernon McMinimy, director ofcommodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.    McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact oncrops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under asubsidy offer.    Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start becauseof a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter"they probably have had more damage due to winter weather thannormal," McMinimy said.

AWB CALLS FOR TIGHTER WHEAT QUALITY CONTROLS Australia is risking wheat exportsales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meetbuyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.    "Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly qualityconscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual qualityspecifications," the board said in a submission to the RoyalCommission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport.    "Many of the specifications are more specific than thecurrent categories used in Australia," it said.    The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costsand boosting efficiency of the grain handling system.    Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat marketshare because its competitors are supplying cheaper butlower-quality grades, the AWB submission said.    It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at everystage from receival to shipping.    Better industrial relations at grain terminals, moreuniform transport systems across the states and extensive stockcontrol were vital to improved marketing, it said.    The submission also said Australia's federal system impededthe AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing ofwheat.    The AWB called for an end to physical and legislativeconstraints at state borders that prevent the efficienttransport of grains to other states for shipment.    "It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic modeto the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state inwhich the wheat is grown or stored," it said.    For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW)might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than toSydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly,southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland orGeelong, in Victoria.    Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly overgrain shipments was one notable impediment, it said.    The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulkhandling authorities is not essential, although it said itfavoured the authorities maintaining at least their currentlevel of control of storage and transport as long as qualitywas maintained.    An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel atvarious Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houstonand 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

U.S. ACREAGE CUTS SEEN LIMITING STOCK BUILD Sharp cuts this year in U.S. plantedacreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile butwill at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, AgricultureDepartment and industry commodity analysts said.    "The scenario is turning around on stocks. The wholesupply/demand picture could finally be getting more inbalance," a USDA analyst said.    The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicatedthat U.S. farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annualacreage reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mlnacres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program,bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres,almost a third of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base.    Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 willprobably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup instocks, analysts said.    "It's a substantially different story from last year whenwe added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile," VernonMcMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said.    Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here,McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likelytranslate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields,final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels.    McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resultingin a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpileof 5.45 billion bushels.    "To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we'reat least in a holding pattern," George Hoffman, director ofcommodity analysis for Pillsbury said.    Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to "significantly less"domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices.    USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage andsaid wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least notincrease. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, nextyear's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said.    "We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now,so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreagereductions, that would be an improvement," an AgricultureDepartment wheat analyst said.    Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be thesmallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lowerfinal production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to100 mln bushels, analysts said.    As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in theconservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programswill be more effective because they will force more highproducing land out of production, a USDA analyst said.    "We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very longtunnel," the analyst said. Reuter

PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER Pakistan is not emerging as a majorwheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough,Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to thePakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.    No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so andplans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothingbecause they could not agree a price, he said.    Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surplusesof one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next fewharvests in years when the weather is favourable.    The government does not wish to increase output much abovethis because of low world prices, and the land would be betterused for other crops.    Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sownto wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched tomore profitable crops such as oilseeds.    The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from thecurrent 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per haover the next five to seven years, he said.    Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which isjust beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mlntonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year'syield of 14.0 mln.    He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but morerecent rains reduced prospects slightly.    The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mlntonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annualpopulation growth rate of more than three pct. Currentconsumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.    The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said.This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mlntonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a"strategic reserve" target of two mln tonnes.    Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes overtarget, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.    The government wants to keep an extra "safety margin" untilit sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheatrationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exportswill be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88crop can be gauged as well, he said.    The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for thegovernment to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at tworupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price inPakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.    Under the old system, introduced during World War Two anddue to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards wereissued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.    Aziz said following the introduction of a governmentsupport price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted thatonly 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching theconsumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.    The ration system had also not had the stabilising effecton the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.    Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction ofthe new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensivePakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.    Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have amajor effect on total consumption, but it may encourage betteruse of side-products such as bran. Reuter
EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND The European Commission's decision torelease an additional 300,000 tonnes of British interventionfeed wheat for the home market will provide only moderaterelief in an increasingly tight market, traders said.    Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage,pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender themarket sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonneswere granted.    The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely tosatisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition forsupplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.    The release of the feed wheat followed recent strongrepresentations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission.There has been growing concern that rising internal prices,triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage ininterior markets.    The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at theApril 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month.The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May andJune.    News of the release produced an early downward reaction inlocal physical markets, but by midday some sections had halvedearly two stg losses while others were unchanged.    Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mlntonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in thefree market. However, some traders believe these figures areoverstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, thebulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also offthe market in futures stores.    A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has beensold for export or to the home market since the season startedJuly 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59mln tonnes.    Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mlntonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.    This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed allearly expectations and has created the present nervoussituation in domestic markets where the fear now is free marketsupplies may not last out until new crop becomes available inAugust.    The market is sticking to its recent prediction of totalbarley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a newrecord and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnesachieved in the 1984/85 season.    Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln andbarley around 4.50 mln tonnes.    The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mlntonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traderssaid.    Other EC countries have bought large amounts of Britishgrain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mlntonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compareswith 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.    The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to staybuoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If suppliesbecome more difficult and prices strengthen further, feedcompounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said. Reuter

BALDRIGE SEES NO TRADE WAR WITH JAPAN U.S. Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige said the dispute between the U.S. And Japan overcomputer chips will not develop into a full-scale trade war.    "I think both sides will try and make sure that this doesn'tstart a trade war -- as a matter of fact I'm positive thatthere won't be a trade war with Japan," Baldrige said in atelevision interview.    President Reagan last week imposed penalties over Japan'salleged failure to adhere to a July 1986 agreement to stopselling semiconductors in third countries at below cost and toopen its own market to U.S.-made chips.    Despite Tokyo's displeasure with the penalties, Baldrigesaid Japan would refrain from taking retaliatory steps thatwould lead to a trade war, largely because Japan itself wouldhave the most to lose in such a conflict.    "Japan, I think will -- because they have the means to do it-- face up to the fact that as the second largest industrialtrading power in the world they have to live up to theirresponsibilities of free trade," he said.    "I think we'll work our way out of this," he added. "It's notgoing to be easy. But I guarantee you, we're not going to havea trade war." REUTER
OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF FAMINE IN BANGLADESH The failure of the Bangladesh governmentto tackle the country's current food crisis could lead to afamine, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, KhaledaZia, told a press conference yesterday.    Prices of rice rose by at least 25 pct across the countryin March and the government has begun emergency rice and wheatsales to lower cereal prices, a food ministry report said.    Ministry officials said the next harvest, due in mid-Aprilwill ease the situation. "Temporary grain shortage in the aridnorth and some other rain-starved regions is not unusual atthis time of the year," one official said.    Khaleda, said corrupt practices by food officials andfailure to procure enough grains contributed to the crisis. Herremarks coincided with newspaper reports that a continuing heatwave has destroyed thousands of acres of crops in thesouth-west.    Officials said last week Bangladesh now has only 390,000tonnes of grain in stock which would be exhausted in two orthree weeks. Bangladesh expects to produce 14.5 mln tonnes ofrice and 1.5 mln tonnes of wheat in 1986/87 ending June 30. Itrevised its food import target for this fiscal year upward by300,000 tonnes to 1.8 mln.

FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, whichwill be sown between May and August or September, has so farnot been as intense as in previous years. Reuter

FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987 The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation(FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely tofall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.    FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total worldgrain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the SovietUnion, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.    World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast torise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening theimpact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenlydistributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.    "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for manydeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, depend cruciallyon the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said.    FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated ata record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than lastseason and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.    FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revisedupwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood ofsubstantial buying by China and the Soviet Union. REUTER

BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT Based on field travel in theBrazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be aboutaverage or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.    It said generally favorable weather from early Decemberthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness.    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 daysfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the secondweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeanswhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, thereport said.    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will createserious storage problems, the report said.    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased bymore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields areexpected to be above average, it said.    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn cropcrop has been harvested.    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grainelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, thereport said.    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Paranaaccounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasonsfor the decline are expected reduced government support priceand good summer crop harvests. Reuter

SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA The U.S. Agriculture Departmentincreased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the SovietUnion to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.    In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, theUSDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated becauseSoviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the lastmonth.    USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising"because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.    All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,USDA said.    Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnesmiscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.    USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop sufferedthrough a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.    The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in aboveaverage winter-kill," USDA said.    Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter lossesmaybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buyinggrain recently.    USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnesgrain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheatand 12 mln tonnes coarse grain. Reuter

AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS Australia could lose valuable wheatmarkets through lack of availability if plantings for thecoming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, AustralianWheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.    "If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings provetrue, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of itsvaluable markets," he said in a statement.    Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWBspokesman said there was a general industry feeling thatfarmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cutback plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.    However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would becut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers werefacing enormous financial pressures.    He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mlnhectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and plantingintentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.    If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut inplantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developedwith much time and effort, it may have great difficulty sellingwheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.    "Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheatunderstand a decrease in production due to drought but theywill have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision todecrease production," Condon said.    "If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major exportincome earner, governments and government authorities will needto closely examine ways of contributing to the continuingviability of the wheat industry," he added.    Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan. REUTER
USDA CHANGES LOW PROTEIN WHEAT TERMINAL PRICES The U.S. Agriculture Department haslowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard redwinter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, asenior USDA official said.    USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at KansasCity and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputyadministrator of commodity operations at the AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service, said.    The department also lowered the terminal price of hard redspring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.    In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hardred spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not tobe identified said.    The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as atPacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.    The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and rollactivity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided uponlast week and will be effective today, he said.    Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiumson high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheatprices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a proteinpremium would remain unchanged.

TOP NATIONS AGREE OVER FARM TRADE ISSUE Ministers from the majortrading nations have for the first time made a concertedcommitment to review the whole distorted structure of worldfarm trade, Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney said.    "We think we can get some movement on this," she toldreporters at a briefing following informal talks with the U.S.,Japanese and European Community (EC) trade ministers here.    Canada, strongly supported by Australia, has championed thecause of both developed and developing nations which have seentheir farm trade suffer largely due to a farm subsidy warbetween the United States and the EC.    Japan"s protected agricultural markets have also attractedcriticism.    The issue is of extreme importance to many indebted,developing nations which often rely totally on one or two farmsector exports to sustain their economies but which cannotcompete with the subsidised U.S. And EC products.    "Canada can afford so many billions of dollars (to do so),but many countries cannot," said Carney.    She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitudeand had raised proposals similar to those of Canada under whichto discuss the issue.    Talks will now continue at the Organisation of EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD), which meets next month, andat the series of discussions on a new world trading framework,begun at Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year.    Carney said Japan had also agreed to take a positive rolein the farm talks, and that the United States was willing tosee short-term progress, as long as long-term solutions werenot affected.    Canada"s five point programme demands that farm productprices must reflect open world market prices, that any supportfor farmers incomes should not be linked to productionincentives, that there should be no new farm subsidies, no newfarm import barriers, and that any decisions should beimplemented collectively.    The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by theindustrialised world until Canada raised it last year at theTokyo summit of seven leading industrial powers.    The distortions created by subsidies and protectionism havecreated some absurd situations.    For example, to protect its farmers the Japanese governmentbuys Canadian wheat and sells it at 10 times the purchase priceto Japanese consumers.    "So we end up borrowing in the Japanese (financial) marketto help pay subsidies to keep our farmers while they make aprofit on our wheat to help pay the price support for theirfarmers," said Carney.    The problem causes pain for many nations and increases thealready dangerously high debts that they owe mainly to U.S.,Japanese and EC banks. REUTER
SEOUL UNVEILS SHOPPING LIST OF U.S. GOODS South Korea unveiled a shopping list of2.6 billion dlrs of U.S. Goods in line with its new policy ofseeking to limiting its trade surplus to ease trade frictionwith Washington.    The government said this would help freeze this year'strade surplus with the United States at the 1986 level.    "The surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dollars last yearfrom 4.3 billion in 1985, was projected to top 10 billion thisyear but the government has taken steps to constrain it to theseven billion dollar level," one Trade Ministry official toldReuters.    A government statement said the 2.6 billion dlrs was inaddition to about two billion dlrs of purchases made last monthby a South Korean trade mission to the United States.    The announcement follows a visit here this week by U.S.Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who said that if SouthKorea wanted to avoid protectionist retaliation it should notfalter in its policies to open its market and cut its surplus.    The statement said the government, state agencies and otherpublic institutions would buy 480 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Cars,computers, helicopters, ambulances, motorcycles, medical andlaboratory equipment and other products. "This amounts includes89 mln dlrs worth of purchases which were not originallyreflected in their budgets," it added.    The list includes 1.13 billion dlrs of capital goods, 700mln of farm products, 50 mln of aluminium, zinc, polyethyleneand other raw materials, and 250 mln of steel, electronics andshipbuilding parts which would be shifted from other nations.    Agriculture Ministry officials said South Korea had alreadybought 310 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Wheat, raw cotton, corn andsoybeans.    This meant the country would buy from the United Statesnearly all of the 1.27 billion dlrs of its planned imports ofsuch commodities this year, they said.    The government will also take steps to reduce tariffs,accelerate the opening of its markets, voluntarily restrainexports and cut export financing, the statement said.    South Korea will also reorganise the country's 3,600 tradeagents to deliver better after-sales services for importedproducts and hold a trade show in November for U.S. Products. Reuter

SHULTZ SAYS U.S. WHEAT BONUS OFFER UP TO USDA U.S. Secretary of State GeorgeShultz said it was up to the Agriculture Department to decidewhether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union.    Shultz told the Newspaper Farm Editors of America that a wheat bonus offer to the Soviet Union "is something that Ibasically leave to the Agriculture Department to figure out."    Last year, Shultz spoke out against President Reagan'sdecision to offer subsidized U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union --an offer Moscow spurned.    "I've always been a little put off by the idea that we wouldarrange our food supplies so as to price them in such a waythat the Soviet housewife could buy American-produced food forless than the American housewife could buy it," Shultz said.    "It also seems to me that if we are going to sell in worldmarkets, we have to meet the price," he added.    Shultz called proposals to broaden the eligibility criteriaof USDA's export enhancement program (EEP) to include all U.S.customers "questionable."    An across-the-board EEP would mark a "considerable change" inthe current program, which Shultz said is designed "to say toother countries that subsidize, particularly the EuropeanCommon Market, that we're not going to give up our markets tothose subsidized sales and we'll have a little kit bag thatwill meet that competition and hold our markets for ourfarmers."    "If you just go across-the-board and subsidize everything,that's a different order of program and seems to me quitequestionable," he said. Reuter

BANGLADESH KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN ON GRAIN PENALTY Bangladesh is keeping its options open onwhether to seek a penalty from Continental Grain Co of theUnited States for alleged breach of a wheat shipment contract,but is also asking the company to expedite shipment of thecargo, a senior Food Ministry official said.    The official, who declined to be named, said the companyunder a deal agreed to ship 100,000 tonnes of wheat by April 7and another 100,000 tonnes by April 16. But it shipped only126,000 tonnes altogether.    The supplier will have to pay penalty at a rate of two dlrsper tonne for every delayed day according to a document signedby both the Food Ministry and the suppliers' agent in Dhaka, hetold Reuters.    "If they arrange quick shipment, we may take a lenient view,"the official said. The issue is expected to be decided at acabinet meeting scheduled for next Sunday, he added.

The local agent of Continental Grain, Shafi AhmedChoudhury, told Reuters he applied to the Bangladesh governmentfor an extension of the shipment period because loading ofwheat at London was being delayed due to bad weather and afaulty elevator at a grain silo. But the government has not yetgranted the extension, he said.    Choudhury said the freight rate and price of wheat had goneup after the deal was signed, which resulted in a financialloss to the company.

FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE The U.S. Department of Agriculture'sforecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks willalmost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not besurprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.    The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'Association and the National Union of Agricultural and CerealCooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports orend-of-season stocks.    However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mlnwas not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.    The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecastin mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare forsoft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 andthe record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.    This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry ofAgriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectaresagainst 4.61 mln in 1986/87.    ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaignwill be released at the beginning of September, an ONICofficial said.    Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult toestimate at this stage, both within the European Community andto non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.    He said, however, that among countries to which Francecould increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghrebcountries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.    The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,was not out of line with estimates of the French MaizeProducers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.    Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields wereexpected to be higher, the AGPM official said.    It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87. Reuter

U.S. WHEAT IN SENEGAL MARKET -- USDA After a highly favorable reception ofa trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of U.S. wheat flourlast February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery ofa first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.

As a result there were a series of baking seminars as wellas the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millersand convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.    The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegalremain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market thathad been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly Frenchwheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.

NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG The Soviets have not indicated anurgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikelythat such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summitexpected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng told Reuters.    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he didnot know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheatsubsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.    "Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me thatthere's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (awheat subsidy)."    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Sovietsummit, Lyng said, "No, I don't think so. I don't think that."    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal toMoscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate fordiscussion at a summit.    "It would not be the kind of issue that the President or theChairman would get into specific negotiations or discussionsabout," Lyng said.    "When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary foragriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat wasnot something that would be discussed with the President of theUnited States. He said it's not presidential," Lyng said.    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some majorproducing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and thestill unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any finaldecision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreementwill be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but theAgriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of thelong-standing agreement.    "We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets havefailed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We wouldlove to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.These are some of the questions we need to discuss."    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted fromthe agreement, Lyng said, "I don't know. It certainly hasn'tbeen what we had hoped it would be. For three years runningthey've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was anagreement." Reuter

EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA The European Community (EC) agreed atrade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the countryfollowing the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, ECofficials said.    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentinawill gain additional trading rights on a series of productsincluding meat, fish and cereals by-products.    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals withCanada and Japan and are due to study these again, theofficials said.    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of ECstates after West Germany withdrew objections to increasedquotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,saying that the main dispute was over sales of cerealssubstitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, theofficials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit fromimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular thequota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef willbe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reducedlevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina saidthat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected theirexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. Theyhave been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade).    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolveCanadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain hadbeen affected by the country's EC membership.    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on thefish dispute with Canada.    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The ECclaims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group hasimproved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfiedwith Japanese offers of compensation.    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems oncitrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for someother farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwearand to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq toldjournalists: "We maintain our position that the (Japanese)concessions were not enough."    "We hope that there will be an improvement," he said.

SENATE PANEL STUDIES LOAN RATE, SET ASIDE PLANS The Senate Agriculture Committee wasexpected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments incounty loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn andwheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.    A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy(D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan ratedifferentials to no more than one pct per year from thenational average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.    The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary toincrease the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by"an appropriate amount to generate savings" if projected cornstocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.    Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat setaside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels. Reuter
