AUSTRALIA'S KEATING CHANGES ECONOMIC FORECASTS Domestic demand is now expected to makeno contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for allof the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.    However, he did not say in his speech to the EconomicPlanning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct risein gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.    But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly thisfinancial year and net export growth will provide the totalsource of gdp growth.    The August budget had forecast domestic demand wouldcontribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.    Keating said the overall impact of the changed economicparameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to aslightly more rapid correction in the current account deficitthan first anticipated.    "The government initially forecast a current account deficitfor 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is thatthe result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion," he said.    Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPACin December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy isbroadly on track, Keating said.    "They indicate that domestic demand has been a little moresluggish than was expected at budget time," he said.    "On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by morethan expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growthin domestic production and employment."    Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflationrate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.    "Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing ininflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetaryeffects wane," he said.    Keating said the government expects economic growth to pickup moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise innet exports and a very moderate but positive contribution fromprivate domestic demand.    He said domestic demand growth will be due to astrengthening in real household disposable income.    The moderate rise in economic growth next financial yearshould be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a levelbroadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.    "The current account deficit will continue to showimprovement in 1987/88," Keating said.    "As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recentyears recede further, and given continued effective wagerestraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88," hesaid. REUTER
SOUTH KOREA TO HOLD CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS DOWN South Korea plans to take steps to keepits 1987 current account surplus below five billion dlrs,Economic Planning Board Minister Kim Mahn-je said.    Kim told reporters the government would repay loans aheadof schedule and encourage firms to increase imports andinvestment abroad to prevent the current account surplus fromrising too quickly.    Last year South Korea's current account surplus was 4.65billion dlrs. It widened to 622 mln dlrs in January from 484mln in December and compared with a deficit of 334 mln inJanuary 1986, Bank of Korea figures show. REUTER

CANADA CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT UP IN QUARTER Canada's current account deficit widenedto a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourthquarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third,Statistics Canada said.    The shortfall for the full year rose to 8.81 billion dlrsfrom 1985's 584 mln dlr deficit, the federal agency said.    The agency said the rise in the merchandise surplus, to2.77 billion dlrs from 2.20 billion dlrs in the third quarter,was more than offset by high deficits in servicies andinvestment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs.    The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourthquarter of 1985.    In the capital account, not seasonally adjusted, there wasa total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter,up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarterquarter.    The total net capital inflow rose to 13.74 billion dlrs in1986 from 7.68 billion dlr in 1985. Reuter
TURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986 Turkey expects a 1986 balance of paymentsdeficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is takingsteps to improve its performance in this and other fields, AliTigrel, director of economic planning at the State PlanningOrganisation said.    He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence ofeconomic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.    Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after adrop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasurywholesale index last year.    This year's target of 20 pct "might be attainable but theeconomic management will have to be careful," he said.    Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programmewhich is central to the government's economic planning, saidTurkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current accountshortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.    "We must alleviate the current account substantially tosustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secureover the last five years," he added.    His comment echoed last October's Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development report on Turkey, which saidAnkara's case for more medium-term financing on better termswould look better if inflation were lower and the currentaccount deficit cut or turned into a surplus.    "In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sectorinvestments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as apercentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visibleimprovement in the current account deficit," he said.    Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year wasalso to blame for the high deficits.    Appropriations to government departments had been cut byeight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreignborrowing by municipalities had been restrained.    "We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to theinvestment programme and do not exceed their appropriations," hesaid. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowingrequirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated5.6 pct in 1986.    More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was alsotargeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourageexports, and production incentives were being considered.    "We must try to make sure that more capacity is injectedinto the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotionpolicy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment andlocal private capital come more into play as far asmanufacturing capacity is concerned," Tigrel said.    He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkisheconomy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still underway. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange ratepolicy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be donein a country where the state still dominates industry and thecurrency is only partially convertible.

U.K. FOURTH QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT 2.6 BILLION STG Britain had a visible trade deficit of2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a reviseddeficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, officialstatistics show.    Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the CentralStatistical Office (CSO) show the current account was indeficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised thirdquarter shortfall of 930 mln.    For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall anda 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.    Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in thefourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give anestimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarterfigure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.    The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.    In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.    The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarterwas due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg anda reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSOsaid.    However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stglower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil tradeincreased by 2.1 billion.    The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.    The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions,particularly for the most recent quarters are liable tosubstantial revisions as later information becomes available. REUTER
OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987 The 24 nations of the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered bysluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economicgrowth, and their joint balance of payments will swing intodeficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.    The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECDeconomic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a2.8 pct growth forecast in December.    It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and thesmaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardesthit by currency appreciation this year.    The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growthrate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct inDecember and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.    It said it expected the OECD to post a current accountdeficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due inlarge part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.    It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely tofall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.    It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlrpayments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.    The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomesincreasingly ragged.    It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline inforeign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on itstrade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after lastyear's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rateis expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with anaverage value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.    "This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeperangle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireballrather than a three-point landing," the EIU said.    "Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and theFebruary meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five andCanada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift tomore expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighterU.S. Fsical policy," it said.    It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was thewillingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Governmentassets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.    "Thus far they have been willing," the EIC said, addingthat if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollarwould collapse.    To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rateswould have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debtcrisis, it said.    On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look"increasingly sick."    Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seenslowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to4.2 pct in 1988, it said.    The weakness of the West German economy is the biggestsingle factor, with import growth there expected to feature asluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast inDecember, the EIU said.    On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in WestGermany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, whileJapan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, morecompetitively-priced dollar.    It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials andoil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986. Reuter
DUTCH PLANNING AGENCY FORECASTS LOWER GROWTH Dutch economic growth is slowing as afirming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industriesreduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planningagency CPB said.    The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economicoutlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected togrow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.    Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increasefrom last year's 423.95 billion.    The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value ofthe guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pctlast year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an averageof 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.    "The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unitlabour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, whilethese are rising slightly in the Netherlands," the CPB said.    More of economic growth now depended on domesticconsumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins setby domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect onpurchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.    Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, theCPB said. Inflation was zero last year.    Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by fivepct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth lastyear, the CPB said.    Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue tocondition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recentyears, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact ofthese factors on Dutch competitiveness.    In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and socialsecurity costs to employers.    The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year,urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring downthe deficit and reduce tax and social security payments infuture.    Dutch government revenue is being depressed further byfalling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.    It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 thisyear from 710,000 last year.    While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB iswithin its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to twopct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.    Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said inits February economic outlook that GDP growth at constantprices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analystshad expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its ownlatest estimate.    "It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the wholedocument yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in someof our estimates," a Pierson economist said.    The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energyexports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.    Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared withfour pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.    The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in thesurplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1billion last year, the CPB forecast. REUTER

DUTCH CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS FALLS IN 1986 The Dutch current account surplus fell5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billionguilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.    The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, thestatement said, but gave no details. Earlier today, theofficial planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus tofall to six billion guilders during 1987.    The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining termsof exchange, while more goods were imported as consumerspending and investment increased.    While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billionguilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporaryimprovements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delaybetween the fall in oil and gas prices.    The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit oninvisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the FinanceMinistry said, noting the surplus on transport services wasreduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil pricefalls.    The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, forthe first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said. REUTER
U.S. PAYMENTS GAP TO PERSIST, EX-FED CHIEF SAYS The dollar will decline over the nexttwo to three years, but this is unlikely to result in acomplete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, saidAnthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and formerpresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.    In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon saidwithout elaboration that he expects a "significant decline inthe dollar," within the next three years.    "The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficitwill stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,"he said.    Solomon described the structural core as about one-half ofthe current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited severalfactors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit.    For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any newinvestment in those manufacturing industries that shrank whenthe dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.    In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increasedpropensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.    Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but saidit could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oilprices are stable and commodity values remain low. Reuter
ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT UP China's foreign debt reached 27 billiondlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure toshort-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains verycreditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreignbankers and Chinese officials told Reuters.    Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply froman estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increasedimport commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low,between eight and 10 pct.    China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.    Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relationsand Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loanagreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.    Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs inthe 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers saidthey estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.    A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too muchshort-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as aresult of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractivelow interest rates in the Japanese market.    The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and islikely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.    A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of thecountry's total debt at about 30 pct.    The Peking representative of a Japanese securities housesaid the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.    "Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China,which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to goelsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread," hesaid.    The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans isin part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capitalmarkets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.    "Officials do not think of China but of their own departmentor firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have thefull backing of the People's Republic of China," he said.    "The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in otherareas, is to balance central control with giving reasonableautonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms toexercise indirect controls," he said.    The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over thepast six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not beaffected by a drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrasemeaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal ofCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.    A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China'sforeign exchange reserves have fallen below the officiallystated figure of 10 billion dlrs.    "The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in themarket, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily inadvance of an announcement the reserves were down," he said.    The banker said such buying has not been going on. "Thingsare normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development."    Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.    A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade officialsaid this year's outlook for exports, which account for morethan 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthierthan a year ago.    The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. Itwas quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago.    The official said China has taken measures to improve itsexport performance, including incentive offers to exporters andthe establishment of export production bases.    "We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year," headded.    Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from thedrop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs.    A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs carefulmanagement but its debt service ratio remains very low at sixto eight pct.    "We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchangereserves but on its export performance, just as you assess acompany on its performance, not its bank account," he said.    He said China performed very well in the export field lastyear and remains a very creditworthy country which will havefew difficulties in increasing its borrowing. REUTER
KOREA PLANS TO OPEN MARKETS TO EASE WON PRESSURE South Korea will further open its marketto help cut its trade surplus with the U.S. And to fight offpressure to revalue the won against the dollar, a governmentspokesman said.    The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha Woong-Bae'sstand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrialnations to revalue the won underlined the government'sdetermination to stand firm.    Rha told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce "Demands that Koreacarry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or10 pct are, I believe, extremely ill-advised."    Deputy prime minister Kim Mahn-Je told a meeting of localbusinessmen "The government's policy on the question ofrevaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position."    Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise thewon's value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at44.5 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.    Six industrialised nations agreed in Paris last month thatnewly industrialising countries, such as South Korea andTaiwan, should allow their currencies to appreciate.    But local businessmen have said won/dollar parity hasalready reached "a crisis level."    An official of the Korea Traders' Association (KTA) said ifthe won strengthened another five pct, this would mean the lossof profitability for nearly half of all South Korean exporters.    "We are determined not to go the way of Latin Americandebtor nations which have suspended interest payments of theirdebts," the spokesman said. "The only way to keep our good recordis to maintain our exports.+    The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue thewon suddenly Korea would run "a tremendous trade deficit andcould degenerate into a country, like many other developingcountries, which is reneging on its international obligations."    The spokesman said South Korea had been graduallyappreciating its currency, ruling out a major revaluation. Sofar this year, the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against thedollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986.    He said South Korea was selecting "many" of 122 items onwhich Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to helpnarrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details weregiven.    Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158items, including sensitive agricultural products and largecars, effective from July.    South Korea posted its first ever current account surpluslast year, due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1billion dlrs, against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985. It earlierforecast that its current account surplus could reach eightbillion dlrs this year.    But the government official said the surplus would be heldat around five billion dlrs to avoid further pressure byindustrialised nations to push up the value of its currency. REUTER

U.S. TRADE DEFICIT 38.37 BILLION DLRS IN 4TH QTR The U.S. merchandise trade deficiton a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrsin the October to December fourth quarter, the CommerceDepartment said.    The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previouslyreported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.    For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was arecord 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985,the department said.    During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exportsrose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.    The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludessuch factors as military sales and the costs of shipping andinsurance.    The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in thequarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billiondlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger carsfrom Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.    Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pctbecause of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the departmentsaid. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported carsand a nine pct decrease from Japan.    On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrsor nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pctor 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.    Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply becausesupplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, werelimited by drought.    Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin Americarose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.

In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs ornine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.    Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lowerprices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrsfrom 26.41 dlrs.    Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pctto 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct andsoybeans nine pct.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA JUMPS IN LAST QTR The net inflow of foreign investmentinto Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarterof 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billiona year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said.    The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billionturnaround in direct investment.    The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billioninflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account ofgovernment foreign currency borrowings, it said.    Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billiondlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal inthe third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourthquarter of 1985, the Bureau said.    It said the major part of the turnaround reflected aninjection of funds, estimated at around 700 mln dlrs,associated with the previously reported restructuring of theAustralian operations of General Motors Corp <GM>.    GM used the funds to pay out or take over certainAustralian liabilities of its local unit <GeneralMotors-Holden's Ltd>, it said.    However, net borrowings remained the major part of totalinflow, accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarteragainst 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion ayear earlier, the Bureau said.    Net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs againsta net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mlninflow a year earlier.    Total private and semi-public authority net borrowings roseto 4.64 billion dlrs from 4.42 billion in the third quarter and3.51 billion a year earlier. REUTER
FRENCH 1986 CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS REVISED The French 1986 current account balanceof payments surplus has been revised slightly upwards to 25.8billion francs from the 25.4 billion franc figure announcedlast month, the Finance Ministry said.    This compares with a 1.5 billion deficit in 1985, and whileit is the first surplus since 1979, is substantially lower thanthe 50 billion surplus forecast by the previous socialistgovernment before they lost office in March last year.    Net long-term capital outflows rose sharply to 70.5 billionfrancs last year from 8.8 billion in 1985, largely due to amajor program of foreign debt repayment, the ministry said.

AUSTRALIAN CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT SEEN NARROWING Australia's current account deficit forFebruary is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mlnand one billion dlrs, from the unrevised January level of 1.29billion, market economists polled by Reuters said.    Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow.    The economists said a key element in the narrowing would bea reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January,after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598mln dlrs.    As an example they quoted wheat export volume, which roseabout 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January.    A lack of aircraft imports in February should alsocontribute on the trade account although it is still likely toremain in deficit, the economists said.    Other positive influences on the current account balanceshould be a decline in the invisibles deficit following aseasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out ofcertain official aid payments, they said.    They said the Australian dollar, which last week touched aneight-month high of 0.6900 U.S. Dlrs but is now around the0.6800 level, should not react adversely to the figures unlessthe current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs.

DANISH CREDIT DOWNGRADING NOT DRAMATIC - MINISTER Finance Minister Palle Simonsen saidtoday's downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by Standard andPoor's Corp should not be over-dramatised.    Standard and Poor's said it had downgraded the Kingdom ofDenmark's long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, followingthe country's loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983.    "This change is regrettable but there is no reason todramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor'sdefines the AA category as only slightly different from the topAAA rating," Simonsen said in a statement.    "The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowingcapability is unlikely to be very great. But if, againstexpectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external accountdeficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms andcapability," he added.    "Standard &amp; Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a seriesof austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending andencourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect.    "If and when it becomes necessary, the government will beready to take any necessary economic and political initiativesas it has in the past," Simonsen said.   Standard and Poor's said weaker internationalcompetitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean adeteriorating current account balance and a rise in externaldebt.    The external current account deficit rose to a recordpreliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns,according to government statistics.    Government economists forecast that the external currentaccount deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year.

It said a four pct decline in rural exports, despite an 11pct rise in wheat exports, was more than offset by a seven pctrise in non-rural exports, notably minerals and fuels.    On the import side, the main decreases were falls of 17 pctin machinery and transport equipment and 21 pct in fuels, theBureau said.

MARKET WELCOMES LOWER AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS DEFICIT The Australian dollar rose more than 40points and money market interest rates retreated on the betterthan expected improvement in the February current accountdeficit, but economists and dealers were cautious aboutidentifying it as the start of a downward trend.    The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs inFebruary from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billiondlrs in 1985/86 to end-June.    The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded ashigh as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69.    "It's got 69 cents written all over it," one dealer said.    Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long onthe dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release.    The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecastsand analysts said the market would welcome any figure below onebillion dlrs for March.    Banque National de Paris <BNPP.A> senior dealer PeterNicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency andinterest rates were too high for import substitution and exportindustries.    Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow.    <Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd> chief economist Will Buttrose saidthe 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January.    But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coalexports remained poor. "We should remember we are payingsomething like seven to eight billion dollars simply to serviceour foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the nearterm," Buttrose said.    Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mlndlrs, and added "Any figure under a billion dollars will beacceptable (to the markets)."    ANZ Banking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> senior economist Ian Littlesaid the big question was whether the improvement in exportscould be sustained.

EC WARNS U.S. AND JAPAN ON TRADE TENSIONS The European Community (EC) yesterdaywarned Japan and the United States, its main trading partners,that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC's relationswith both countries.    EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan'scontinued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to makea greater effort to open up its markets. They also said theywere disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress thatwould impose permanent quotas on textile imports and wereprepared to react. The U.S. Administration has alreadydistanced itself from the bill.    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has writtento his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,outlining the EC's concerns.    The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S.Moves towards protectionism. "The adoption of such measureswould not fail to have a negative effect on the process ofmultilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateralrelations," it said.    Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option butto react according to the laws of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, it said.    In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers saidthey "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance intrade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more."    The statement said the EC would continue to insist thatJapan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand.    Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare areport on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable themto take appropriate action where necessary.    One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministerswere determined not to let the Japanese question drop. "It willbe back on the table again and again," the diplomat said.    De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said,"There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within theCommunity concerning trade relations with Japan."    The EC is not satisfied with Japan's inability to cut itstrade surplus, and the Commission has adopted a tough approachon imports of goods such as Japanese photocopiers, where it hasimposed 20 pct anti-dumping duties.    But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyoto solve the problem rather than embark on a costly anddamaging trade war, and the ministers called for morecooperation with Japan in industry and research.

Previously, the department said the third-quarter deficitwas 36.28 billion dlrs.    For the full year 1986, the current account, a broadmeasure of trade performance, was in deficit a record 140.57billion dlrs after a 117.68 billion dlr deficit in 1985.    The department said an increase in the merchandise tradedeficit during the fourth quarter to 38.4 billion dlrs from37.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter was the main reason forthe worsening deficit.    Net service receipts declined to 5.5 billion dlrs in thefinal quarter from six billion dlrs in the third quarter.    The current account includes trade in merchandise andservices as well as U.S. financial transactions with the restof the world.    The department said the merchandise trade deficit for allof 1986 grew to 147.7 billion from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985.    Net service receipts were 22.3 billion dlrs in 1986,compared with 21.7 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.    Net unilateral transfers during the fourth quarter lastyear, covering foreign aid and government pensions, were downto 3.9 billion dlrs from 4.2 billion dlrs in the third quarterbecause of fewer U.S. government grants to Mideast countries.    Liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S. banks rose 35.3billion dlrs between October and December after increasing 30.1billion dlrs in the third quarter.    For the full year, these liabilities grew 77.4 billion dlrsafter rising by 40.4 billion dlrs in 1985.    The department said inflows were boosted in the fourthquarter by international activities of Japanese banks andstrong demand within the United States to finance acquisitions.    Net foreign sales of U.S. Treasury securities by foreignerswere 2.7 billion dlrs in the quarter after purchases of 500 mlndlrs in the third quarter.    Net foreign purchases of securities other than U.S.Treasury securities in the fourth quarter were 11.8 billiondlrs, compared with 17.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter.    For all 1986, foreign purchases of securities excludingU.S. Treasury securities were a record 70.7 billion dlrs,surpassing the previous record 50.9 billion dlr total in 1985.   Claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks in the fourthquarter rose 29.9 billion dlrs after a 19.3 billion dlrthird-quarter increase.    U.S. sales of foreign securities rose to 2.7 billion dlrsfrom 300 mln dlrs in the third quarter because of a sharpselloff of foreign stocks and bonds, the department said.    Outflows for U.S. direct investment abroad fell to 5.7billion dlrs from eight billion dlrs in the third quarter.    Foreign direct investment in the United States increased14.4 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.6billion dlrs in the previous quarter, because of stepped-upacquisitions, the department said.    Foreign official assets in the United States increased 800mln dlrs between October and December after rising 15.4 billiondlrs in the third quarter.

ANALYSTS SAY U.K. BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balancedby analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.    A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expectedtomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. Afollow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.    "Worthy but boring would probably sum it up," Peter Fellner,U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. "It wasa very, very prudent fiscal budget."    Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was awell-balanced budget within the confines of the government'sphilosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.    Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscalside, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.    As was widely expected, Lawson split his "fiscal adjustment"between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stgfrom 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to27 pct.    The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, waskept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broadSterling M3 aggregate was dropped.    Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way fora half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but theauthorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a fullone-point cut tomorrow.    "The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action whichit will have to reverse later," Jeffrey said, though he added afurther half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.    The main worry from today's speech is the outlook forinflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy containedin it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.    Holt noted the "rather loose" inflation forecast of 4.0 pctat end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to resultfrom the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.    "A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,"he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back offalling base rates would have an offsetting impact oninflation.    The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence butit was "not a good budget for inflation," he said    Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more aboutthe dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was nottoo concerned about a revival of inflation.    Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the"leading edge" of monetary policy, but said the authorities werelikely to be extremely cautious on this front.    He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interestrates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed anysigns of excessive weakness.    Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibilityof the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.    Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility bythe favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecastto be 4.0 billion stg.    But analysts said the Budget speech did not give anyclear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,which has to be held before June, 1988.    Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that thebenefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raiseduties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.    But others said it kept several options open and it was notpossible to deduce too much from it.    James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election inthat there would be no "chickens coming home to roost."    Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a Juneelection, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone fora Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.

INDONESIA SEES LIMITED CHOICES ON ECONOMY Indonesia cannot spend its way out ofrecession and has very limited economic options due to lowerworld oil prices, Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar wasquoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.    "If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much, such asthrough expansionary monetary and budgetary policies, it mightcreate negative effects not only on price increases, but alsoon the balance of payments," he told bankers and businessmen inthe North Sumatran city of Medan.    Antara quoted him as saying Indonesia is relying on itsexport drive to help narrow its trade deficit.    Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted tohelp boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries,which are centered in Sumatra.    "I see Sumatra has great potential, as in the plantationsector in which family units are employed in great number," hesaid, according to the agency.    Indonesia relied on oil and gas exports for 70 pct of itsexport revenue until last year's fall in crude prices.    It has projected its current account deficit will widen toover four billion dlrs in the current financial year endingMarch 31 from 1.8 billion in 1985/86. REUTER
AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS HELPING TO BOOST GDP The strong contribution of exports tothe growth in Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in thefourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature ofthe data, private economists polled by Reuters said.    Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, afterrising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a yearearlier.    Equally significant was the decline in both private andgovernment spending, they said.    Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourthquarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureaufigures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and governmentspending by 0.2.    Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking GroupLtd said the government's aim of reducing the current accountdeficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cutimports appeared to be working.    However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keepgrowth restrained because if it accelerated too fast importswould increase and worsen the balance of payments.    Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added theresult was positive because growth was export-driven.    But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given thegrowth in exports disclosed in other statistics.    The economists' comments were echoed by Treasurer PaulKeating in a statement issued in Canberra.    Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for areduction in the current account deficit, notably the declinein domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.    A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarterunderscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices andpublic sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia'scompetitiveness, he said.    "It is clear that through the continued application of thatstrategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in itsexternal accounts and return to a more sustainable growthpattern," he added.

KEATING SEES LOWER AUSTRALIAN CURRENT DEFICIT Australian Treasurer Paul Keating saidhe expects the country's 1986/87 current account deficit to beone billion dlrs lower than the 14.7 billion forecast in theAugust budget. Keating told a financiers' dinner thatFebruary's 750 mln dlr deficit, against January's 1.23 billion,was "in the groove" of the government's expectations.    "We will probably bring the current account this year under14 billion, I think, which will probably be about a billiondollars less than we forecast in the budget," Keating said. "I amsure we will see a lower current account deficit for next year... And a fall as proportion of GDP."    Australia posted a 13.82 billion dlr current accountdeficit in 1985/86 and Keating said the latest monthly figuresshowed an encouraging trend.    Keating said the government would maintain responsibleeconomic management regardless of whether it was drawn into anelection, because it would take time to stabilise Australia's80 billion dlr foreign debt.    "We have to build the import competing sector back," he said."We are now trying to rebuild our capital structure. We aretrying to rebuild the culture of productivity andmanufacturing."    Keating said the foundation for a transition of the economyhad been laid with the floating of the Australian dollar andcontinued with wage restraint and deregulation.    The Government would follow with spending cuts in itseconomic statement on May 14, he said. REUTER

Theprovisional January trade surplus narrowed to 7.2 billion marksfrom a record 11.6 billion marks the month before.

 German Feb current account surplus 6.6 billion marks (Jan surplus 4.8 billion) -  West Germany's current accountsurplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in Februaryfrom a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, aspokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.    The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.    The Statistics Office had originally put the Januarycurrent account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.    The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billionmark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the currentaccount surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplusrecorded in February 1986.    A Statistics Office statement said the widening of theFebruary current account surplus compared with January was dueto seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current accountfigures are seasonally adjusted.    February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.    Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pctcompared with January.    The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculatethe real change in exports and imports in February. But forcomparison purposes it noted that in January the average valueof imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the averagevalue of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.    Within the current account, the services account had 300mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln marksurplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion markdeficit.    Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports invalue terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with ayear earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.    The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks forJanuary/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1billion marks in the year-ago period.    The cumulative current account surplus for January andFebruary 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billionmarks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.    Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplusreflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well asseasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlierthis week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct againstJanuary while export prices were unchanged.    "The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trendthat is not expected to change for several months at least,"said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said thesurplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.    An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) inFrankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave amore accurate picture of West Germany's trade position.    He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January andFebruary together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplusposted in November and December.    "The trend is clearly lower," he said.    This economist, who declined to be named, said the Februaryrise was also partly explained by special factors in January,when there had been a number of public holidays as well asextremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.

The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greetedenthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have leftthe voters indifferent, political observers said.    Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warnthat today's improved sentiment could be dented if support forPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.    This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, whichare all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcominggeneral election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,Harwood said. "The news did come as a very, very substantialrelief," he said.    However, on the interest rate front, economists cautionthat Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable byencouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson hadalready got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates inresponse to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons forlower rates have been curtailed. REUTER

TRADE SURPLUS WILL POSE ADDED PRESSURES FOR JAPAN Japan today announced another mammothmonthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure tointensify already mounting pressure on the country for action.    "The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for notmoving more quickly," Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economistEric Rasmussen said.    The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplussoared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion inJanuary and 4.77 billion a year ago.    The current account surplus, which includes trade inservices as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs lastmonth from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago.    After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figureslook a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the tradesurplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs froma record 9.58 billion in January.    "In the medium term we expect this modest improvement tocontinue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward offfurther protectionism or further yen strength," said WilliamStirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.    A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive onworld markets while making imports into the country cheaper.    "On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making someprogress on getting exports down," Jardine's Rasmussen said.    But imports do not seem to be picking up much because theJapanese economy remains sluggish, he said.    Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slowerimport growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners workedoff stocks they had built up in January.    The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume ofexports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increasein January.    This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yenagainst the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impacton exports, they said.    But economists warned that may not be soon enough forJapan's trading partners. REUTER

KENYAN MINISTER FORECASTS ECONOMIC EXPANSION Kenya's economy will continue to expandthis year and the government will do more to encourageinvestment by foreign firms and the local private sector,Planning Minister Robert Ouko said.    He told a news conference that the government would sooncreate a special bureau to expedite processing of investmentapplications by local and foreign investors.    Praising the role of multinational companies and localentrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised tomaintain a close working contact with the private sector.    The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in1985, Ouko said.    This was owing to high prices for the country's coffeeexports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes,he added.    "Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987," theplanning minister said.    "High aggregate demand arising from low inflation, tradeliberalisation and disciplined financial management areexpected to increase output in the manufacturing sector," hesaid.    Agriculture would expand significantly if favourableweather continued and farmers responded to producer price risesannounced in February, the minister added.    Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of thelong rainy season, which is due to start about now.    Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash cropsincreased during the second half of last year.    Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenyarose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period,he said.    Ouko paid tribute to the private sector for itscontribution to the economy and promised to improve governmentcooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contactwith them.    "I wish to pay tribute to the private sector for itscontribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it tomaintain the same spirit this year ... The manufacturing sectorgrew by an estimated 5.8 pct in 1986, in line with the sameperiod the previous year," he said.    Ouko said the "one stop" bureau was intended to stimulateinvestment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involvedin processing applications.    The planning minister presented a review of the Kenyaneconomy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflationfalling to 4.3 pct from 10.2 a year earlier.    This was owing to higher agricultural production and theKenyan shilling's relative strength against other majorcurrencies, the report said.    The average exchange rate was 16.23 shillings per U.S. Dlrlast year, a fall of only 1.2 pct from 16.432 in 1985. The halfyearly report said exports increased about 30 pct inJuly-December 1986, while imports rose by only six pct duringthe period.    This gave Kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of780 mln Kenya shillings (48 mln dlrs) during the period,compared with a 1.4 billion shilling (87 mln dlr) deficit inthe second half of 1985, it said.

PORTUGAL'S GDP FORECAST TO GROW FOUR PCT THIS YEAR Portugal's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)will grow around four pct this year, the same rate as in 1986,according to a Bank of Portugal forecast.    Total investment this year, the country's second as amember of the European Community (EC), will rise nearly 10 pct,again the same rate as last year, the central bank study said.    It added that Portugal's current account was forecast toshow a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year.    Last year's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil andraw materials, lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar.    Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this yearand exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said.    The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that thenon-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the currentgovernment would be maintained, particularly in budget spendingand income and in wage policy.    The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based onthe assumption that the international economic situation andPortugal's world trade relations would remain more or less thesame as in 1986.    The central bank said the high rate of investment estimatedfor 1986 was due to government policies and to increasingoptimism among firms whose financial situation had improvedsince 1985. This tendency was expected to continue this year,especially in the construction and public works sectors.    Financial aid from the EC had also helped to boostinvestment last year, the bank said.

SOUTH KOREA MOVES TO SLOW GROWTH OF TRADE SURPLUS South Korea's trade surplus is growing toofast and the government has started taking steps to slow itdown, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.    He told a press conference the government planned toincrease investment, speed up the opening of the local marketto foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to holdthe surplus "at a proper level."    But he said the government would not allow the won toappreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea hasbeen under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.    The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus withthe U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3billion dlrs in 1985.    Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospectswere bright for the South Korean economy, but the governmentwould try to hold the current account surplus to around fivebillion dlrs a year for the next five years.    "Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, fivebillion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth inexports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But nowthe surplus is growing faster than we expected," he said.    Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of thisyear, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.    Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to asurplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlrdeficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled thecountry to reduce its foreign debt last year for the firsttime.    South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrsin 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largestin Asia.    "This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of themajor constraints on our development... Last year was a majorturning point for the Korean economy," Kim said.    Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio offoreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, fromabout 50 pct in 1986.    "The government, however, does not want to acceleratereducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus," hesaid.    Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflationand lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,particularly the United States.    "We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, butwe are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at aproper level," Kim said. REUTER

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MUST CUT SPENDING, ANZ SAYS The government must announce harsh cutsin spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to givean adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZBanking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> said.    Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against thebackdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthlyBusiness Indicators publication.    "For the past two years, the government has struggled withan economic reality that demands measures beyond those which itsees as politically practicable," it said.    The political climate meant there would be a continuedover-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate andmaintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.    "The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revivalof business investment will be further postponed," it said.    The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted byexport and import-replacement industries which had created afalse suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance ofpayments crisis were past. "Unfortunately, successful adjustmentto Australia's deep-seated economic problems remains along-term process," it said.    In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderateoverall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP)rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.    The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDPthis year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would growstrongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion atend-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.    Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages wereexpected, ANZ said. REUTER
INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY The five leading West German economicresearch institutes have failed to agree about how strongly thedomestic economy will expand this year but revised downforecasts contained in a report published six months ago.    The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essenpredicted in the institutes' joint spring report that grossnational product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, comparedwith 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecastthree pct 1987 growth in October last year.    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlinand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.    The joint report said that the estimates of economicdevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were "markedly lessfavourable" than those of the other three.    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after aslow start to the year. "In the second half of 1987 there will,however, only be a weak upward movement," they said.    The two institutes said external economic factors whichwere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports woulddominate the economic environment throughout the year. They sawexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted nomarked improvement in the course of the year.    The other three institutes, however, wrote: "The decline indemand and production (seen) in the winter months does notindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing."    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporateuncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.But they expected that many investments had not been cancelledbut only put off. "It can be presumed that the braking actions(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year."    They added: "The domestic prerequisites for a continuationof the economic uptrend are still favourable."    These three institutes said diminishing external burdenscombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn indemand and production could be expected by the spring.    However, this projection was clouded by risks including thefurther development of the mark against the dollar.    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said thatwhile exports would continue to be the weak point of theeconomy in 1987, "there is good reason to believe that exportswill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge duringthe course of the year." They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fallin exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.    The three more positive institutes saw private consumptionrising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving butpredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline inunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said thejobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people inwork of about 200,000.    These three institutes said new jobs would be createdmainly in the private services sector and also by the state inthe context of job creation measures. The construction industrywas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980but they predicted either no rise in employment in themanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur onlyin the tertiary sector, while "the number employed in themanufacturing industry will decline."    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw acurrent account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marksand predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.    The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start torise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all fivepredicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct. REUTER
PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS Portugal's economy, which has beenenjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latestgovernment crisis, analysts said.    But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal CavacoSilva's government could slow economic reforms and investmentas Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the EuropeanCommunity, which it joined in January last year, they said.    Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, wastoppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.    The centre-right administration had made economic growthreform a priority in its 17 months in office.    In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its currentaccount surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs andinflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.    Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instabilitywere worrying but they felt the foundations for continuedgrowth had not been badly shaken.    "The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that isnow less dependent on the political situation," said FritzHaser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.    "The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet," economistJorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.    Businessmen have identified political instability over thelast 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lastingeconomic progress.    The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974revolution.    Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remainbuoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surgein economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largelyunderpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.    Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank ofPortugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growthwould remain at similar levels this year.    But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policiesand could slow economic development.    Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the endof the month, can either call early elections or form a newgovernment from parties in the existing left wing-dominatedparliament.    Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quickelections as the best solution. "There is a good chance that amajority government could result from early elections,"Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president PedroFerraz da Costa said.    He said they were optimistic this could mean thecontinuation in the near future of liberalisation policiesintroduced over the last year.    The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, butthe PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion pollssay they could win an overall majority.    A PSD majority would also open the way for morewide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws andpossible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.    Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition partiesof blocking key economic reforms.    The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic resultswere more the product of favourable international conditionssuch as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSDpolicies. REUTER
SOUTH KOREA TO CHANGE POLICIES TO AVERT TRADE WAR South Korea has decided on major changesin its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducingthe growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding atrade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister KimMahn-je said.    Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exportscould make South Korea too reliant on exports, increasenflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, whichmeans abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreigndebt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.    Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said thecurrent account surplus, previously expected to exceed eightbillion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billiondlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisationand rationalising exports.    He said Seoul would try to limit its current accountsurplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next fewyears, although trade volume would continue to grow.    "This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP(gross national product) from the current five pct level tothree pct by 1991," he added.    Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreigndebt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the endof 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5billion dlrs at end-1986.    "But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected toremain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lowerthan the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs," he said.    The policy change was announced two days before thescheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigefor talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.    South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateraltrade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.    Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swingin South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billiondlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mlndlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.    The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, rawmaterials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.    "The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), areconsiderable incentives given to increase imports," Koo said.    Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency."It means they could become interest-free loans if the Koreancurrency continues to rise in value," he said.    He said the South Korean won would be revalued against thedollar gradually, but added "We do not believe in rapid one-shotchanges in the value of the won."    The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen sixpct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986. REUTER

The summary said, "These reforms would result in (domestic)prices much more in line with world prices than is true today,and in a greater degree of import competition and exportrivalry than the nation has ever seen."    The summary said foreign trade must play a key role inIndia's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberalimports of capital goods would help modernise the economy andexpose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exportswould provide the foreign exchange for imports.    "The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the presentprinciple of unlimited protection for all indigenouslyavailable products and to recognise the role of actual orpotential competition from imports as a source of discipline onthe prices and costs of public and private sector domesticmanufacturers," the summary said.    An Indian official told Reuters the government wasdiscussing the report with the Bank. A final report with somechanges was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to givefurther details.    The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank'sfinal report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discussaid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June.    The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grewat an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and1986/87, which ended in March.    It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct ofgdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed bynational savings, mainly from the private sector.    India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowedto 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96billion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86.    But the summary said the improvement was largely due tolower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertiliserswhich make up the bulk of India's import bill.    India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreignexchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, thesummary said.    The Bank's summary said there was little room forcomplacency in the balance of payments position.    It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87,Indian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs.    Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct ayear in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viablebalance of payments, the summary said.    It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued.India "might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting whileundertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives thatinvolve some political costs," it said.    "An example of such a policy would be the adoption of anexchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability,"the summary said.    It said such an approach had been successful in countriessuch as South Korea, Colombia and Turkey. It would maintain thecompetitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduceimport pressures.    Earlier this year, the Indian government denied that theWorld Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boostexports. REUTER
ZIMBABWE BANKING CORP URGES POLICY REFORM A range of substantial policyinitiatives need to be implemented to shift resources fromconsumption to production in the Zimbabwe economy, says theZimbabwe Banking Corporation (ZBC) in its quarterly economicreview.    The state owned banking group says although Zimbabwe'sbalance of payments improved significantly last year theunderlying position deteriorated. Last year's improved tradesurplus was partly the result of sales of stockpiled gold andcontinued import restraint.    It says debt service charges are projected to exceed 35 pctof exports in 1987 and warns against squeezing imports further.    ZBC says mining industry import quotas for the first sixmonths of 1987 have been halved and those for manufacturingindustry cut by a third.    It contrasts the performance of manufacturing industry in1967 to 1974, with that since independence in 1980. Industrialproduction almost doubled between 1967 and 1974, when foreigncurrency allocations almost trebled in real terms.    Since 1980, import allocations have been cut 45 pct and theZimbabwe dollar has depreciated by more than 60 pct. As aresult the bank says the external purchasing power of foreigncurrency allocations is currently only 20 pct of its 1980levels. REUTER
GERMAN GROWTH WILL NOT CUT U.S. DEFICIT -BANGEMANN Economics Minister Martin Bangemann, whoflies to Washington this weekend for high level talks, saidboosting West German economic growth would not have anysignificant effect on the high U.S. Current account deficit.    In a paper prepared ahead of his trip, Bangemann saidBonn's trading partners had been asking whether West Germangrowth was slowing and whether the Federal Republic should notin the future pursue more strongly expansionary policies.    In the paper Bangemann wrote, "It is not possible to reducethe U.S. Current account deficit by any signficant amount justthrough more stimulation of the West German economy."    One U.S. Administration policy maker said in Washingtonthis week that the United States government wanted West Germanyand Japan to reduce their interest rates even further tostimulate their economies.    Bangemann said it was clear the high mark, as well asuncertainty about further currency developments, was makingcompanies here cautious about production plans and investments.    While West Germany did not seek exchange rates whichunilaterally favoured its exports, it favoured more stabilityand realistic rates, which corresponded to "fundamentals."    He welcomed the February "Louvre Agreement" of six industrialnations to stabilise currencies and said, "(We) expect allparties to hold by the accords struck there." West Germany hadfulfilled its pledge of boosting planned tax cuts, he noted.    Despite calls for lower interest rates, BundesbankVice-President Helmut Schlesinger has hinted that central bankpolicy may even have to be tightened.    He wrote in a newspaper article published yesterday thatthe Bundesbank's current accommodative stance could notcontinue in the long term.    During his trip to Washington, which runs from April 26 to29, Bangemann will meet Secretary of State George Shultz, tradeenvoy Clayton Yeutter, World Bank President Barber Conable, IMFManaging Director Michel Camdessus and Paul Volcker, Chairmanof the Federal Reserve Board.

UGANDAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSES NEW TAXES The Ugandan government, in its fouryear investment and development plan, proposed taxing land andfood crops in an attempt to broaden its revenue base away fromdependence on coffee sales.    The government also said in the plan, made available toReuters, that a devaluation of the Ugandan shilling would dolittle to redress a chronic balance of payments deficit.    The plan, the first since President Yoweri Museveni tookpower 15 months ago, seeks to raise 2.4 billion dlrs ininvestment funds from abroad between 1987 and 1991.    It says the government had already secured 1.4 billion dlrsin pledges before Islamic lenders promised a further 494 mlndlrs at a conference in Kampala last week.    Uganda already had an external debt of 984 mln dlrs at theend of 1986 and in the nine months of the current budget debtservicing will cost 204 mln dlrs, almost 50 pct of exportearnings of 431 mln, the plan said.    The new fiscal measures include a proposed tax on largeland holdings, regardless of whether the owners are exploitingthem, and taxes on maize, beans and other crops sold by theProduce Marketing Board.    The plan says the aim is to spread the tax burden, which inUganda has traditionally fallen almost exclusively on coffeefarmers. Coffee provides over 90 pct of foreign exchangeearnings and more than 70 pct of government revenue.    On exchange rate policy, it repeats Museveni's argumentthat any form of fotation would not help allocating resources.    Western governments and multilateral funds say the Ugandanshilling is grossly overvalued and the government must changethe exchange rate if it wishes to encourage investment. Theshilling sells on the black market at more than 15,000 to thedollar, compared with an official rate of 1,400. REUTER

ECUADOR ECONOMY SEEN CONTRACTING IN 1987 The Ecuadorean economy, struck by anearthquake last month, will contract an estimated four pct in1987 and its crude oil output will drop by 42 pct, thegovernment's national development council (Conade) said.    A Conade report, dated April 21 and obtained, said that thecountry's gross domestic product (gdp) would fall by anestimated four pct compared to 1.5 pct growth last year. Conadefunctions as the country's main planning institution.    Crude output will fall to 61.2 mln barrels in 1987 from105.6 mln in 1986, Conade said. It forecast exports of 22.9 mlnof crude and derivatives against 63.3 mln last year.    The March five earthquake killed up to 1,000 people andcaused an estimated one billion dlrs in damage. It paralyzedEcuador's crude output because it ruptured the country's mainpipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of jungle oilfields, tothe Pacific Ocean port of Balao.    It will take until at least end-July to repair the line andreturn output to normal levels, oil officials said. Ecuadoroutput was about 250,000 barrels per day before the tremor.    Conade forecast total 1987 exports of 1.77 billion dlrs,572 mln dlrs of which would be oil and derivatives.    Imports were forecast at 1.70 billion dlrs. Total 1986exports were 2.18 billion dlrs, of which 979 mln dlrs werecrude and derivatives, with total imports 1.66 billion dlrs.    Conade predicted that payments on Ecuador's 8.16 billiondlrs foreign debt will be limited to 947 mln dlrs this yearagainst 1.489 billion dlrs last year. Conade's projectedceiling on payments is not legally binding.    The current account balance of payments deficit was seen at934 mln dlrs in 1987. It was 696 mln dlrs in 1986. Reuter

GERMAN TRADE SURPLUS SHOULD NARROW, BUNDESBANK SAYS Germany's current account and tradesurpluses should narrow sharply in 1987 but they will take along time to get back to normal levels, the Bundesbank said inits 1986 yearly report.    The procedure would be slow as an abrupt turnaround inexternal factors such as oil prices and exchange rates was notexpected. It did not specify what levels it considered normal.    West Germany posted a record trade surplus of 124 billionmarks in 1986, after 86 billion in 1985 and its current accountsurplus widened to 76.50 billion from 44.6 billion.    Signs imports would continue to rise, a factor alreadynoted at the start of 1986, while exports rose only slightly,would lead to a smaller trade surplus, the Bundesbank said.    In real terms, West German imports rose 5.7 pct in 1986while exports only increased by 0.8 pct.    Germany's current account surplus widened to a provisional6.6 billion in February from 4.8 billion in January but wasdown from 6.85 billion posted in February 1986.    The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4billion marks from 7.2 billion in January and was still abovethe 6.84 billion reached in the same month the year before. REUTER
GERMAN CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS WIDENS IN MARCH West Germany's current accountsurplus widened to a provisional 8.8 billion marks in Marchfrom a slightly downwards revised 6.5 billion in February, aspokesman for the Federal Statistics Office said.    The trade surplus fell to a provisional 10.1 billion marksfrom 10.4 billion in February.    The Statistics Office had earlier put the February currentaccount surplus at a provisional 6.6 billion marks. Theprovisional February trade surplus was confirmed.    The Office said the March trade surplus had also risenstrongly from the year-ago month total of 8.5 billion marks,while the March current account surplus compared with only 4.3billion marks a year earlier.    The figures given by the office show nominal trade flows,but an office statement said that the current account surplushad also risen in real terms from February.    However, it attributed this partly to the fact thatpayments to the European Community had been brought forward inFebruary, with the result that transfers abroad in March wereunusually low.    The Statistics Office said March imports totalled 36.93billion marks, a rise of 15 pct from February and of 4.7 pctcompared with March 1986.    March exports of 47.06 billion marks were 11 pct higherthan in February and 7.6 pct higher than in March last year.    Other data reported in the current account balance showedthere was a 400 mln mark deficit in supplementary trade items,a 500 mln mark deficit in the services account and a 400 mlnmark deficit in transfer payments.    The Statistics Office said that in the first three monthsof this year the trade surplus had risen to 27.8 billion marksfrom 22.6 billion marks in the same period last year.    The current account surplus had risen to 20.0 billion marksfrom 15.6 billion. REUTER
U.K. ECONOMY STRONGER THAN AT BUDGET, LAWSON SAYS The U.K. Economy looks stronger than itdid only last month, when the government unveiled its budgetfor fiscal 1987/88, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid.    He told Parliament that "all the indicators that have beenpublished since the budget confirm that, if anything, we aredoing even better than I suggested then." The budget wasunveiled on March 17.    "The PSBR (Public Sector Borrowing Requirement) has come outlower than I forecast in the Budget. Inflation, too, is lowerthan I suggested ... (and) the current account of the balanceof payments is also performing better, so far, than Ipredicted."    The budget foresaw inflation easing to 4.0 pct at the endof this year after peaking at around 4.5 pct. Lawson said atthe time that the overall 1986/87 PSBR would be around 4.0billion stg. It was in fact lower, at 3.3 billion stg.    He had also projected average GDP growth in calendar 1987of 3.0 pct after 2.5 pct in 1986. Lawson today said "outputappears to be rising, if anything, rather faster."    Speaking during a House of Commons debate, he said, "by theend of this year we will have registered the longest period ofsteady growth, at close to 3.0 pct a year, that the Britisheconomy has known since the (Second World) War."    The 1987/88 budget contained a proposal to cut the basicrate of taxation by two pence, to 27 pence in the pound.    Lawson today reaffirmed that the government aimed tofurther cut the standard rate to "no more than 25p." He said thatthat objective "should not take too long to achieve."    Turning to policies proposed by political oppositionparties, Lawson said those advocated by the Labour Party wouldentail extra public expenditure of some 34 billion stg.    That, he said, "would require either a doubling of the basicrates of income tax or more than trebling the standard rate of(valued added tax) VAT," which is currently 15 pct.    On value added tax, Lawson noted that the Conservativegovernment promised back in 1984 not to extend VAT to food.    "Beyond that, the incidence of taxation has to be determinedin the light of the budgetary needs at the time, and noresponsible government could conceivably take any otherposition," he said. Labour MPs have accused the Conservatives ofplanning VAT increases for some essential consumer goods.    Lawson reiterated his belief that reductions in taxationcan often produce higher, not lower, revenues  "thus leading tothe scope for still further reductions in taxation."    Lawson said "inheritance tax is expected this year to yieldalmost 50 pct more in real terms than Capital Transfer Tax didin 1978-79. The yield of Capital Gains Tax is forecast to be 80pct higher in real terms, and Stamp Duty up by 140 pct."    He said that "the greatly increased yield of CorporationTax, reflecting greatly increased company profitability, isclearly connected with the reform of Corporation Taxation Iintroduced in 1984, which brought the rate of tax on companyprofits in this country to the lowest in the industrialisedworld."

However, the government had subsequently revised theforecast to around 13.75 billion dlrs after a series of currentaccount figures indicated a declining trend.

Keating said the main reason for his revision was abetter-than-expected export performance. Recent quarterlyfigures showed export volumes rose 14.4 pct in the half-year toMarch 30 while import volumes rose only 0.9 pct, he said.

OECD SEES GERMAN GROWTH HIT BY LOW DOMESTIC DEMAND West German economic growth will slow to1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domesticdemand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisationfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in itssemi-annual review of the world economy.    This view is less favourable than the West Germangovernment's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct thisyear, but is in line with forecasts by independent economicinstitutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.    The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year,with the gross national product rising by two pct in realterms.    The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passingthrough a period of temporary weakness and there would be somerecovery in business confidence in the near future.    But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economywas higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.    While noting that the government is bringing forward a fivebillion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that "themedium to longer-term performance of the West German economycould be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allowrelatively lower tax rates."    Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German FederalStatistics Office has released figures showing that the GNPactually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter ofthis year compared with the final three months of 1986.    Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appearedlikely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any ofthe Group of Seven leading industrial nations.    West Germany's current account surplus, the target ofconsiderable criticism by the Reagan administration, isexpected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in1988.

JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD Japan's trade surplus is likely tocontinue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroadincrease while domestic demand remains sluggish, theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)said.    In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, theOECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus lastyear, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 whileexport markets rose by only two pct.    But it said this differential between the growth ofdomestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,"thus weakening the international adjustment process."    It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over twopct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pctin 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 willrise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.    The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billionyen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demandand increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said themeasures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quitepossibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects haveworked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.    The OECD outlook said, "Continued large current accountsurpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantialnet external asset position could well lead to upward pressureon the yen." It said that further appreciation could then leadmanufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thusweaken domestic growth.    The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely togorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pctgrowth. But it said Japan would continue its good performanceon inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year. Reuter
OECD URGES ACTION TO CUT U.S. BUDGET DEFICIT The United States should take urgentaction to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possiblereductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs ongrowth of the defense budget, the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development said.    The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congressquickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit "could seriouslyaffect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere."    It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,running until September 30 this year, would substantiallyovershoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billiondlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.    "The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions ofslower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for thefirst half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190billion dollars," it said.    While this would be 30 billion lower than last year'sdeficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate taxincreases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.    The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.    In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exportsboosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.    Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the servicesector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to beheading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumerprices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct nextyear after just 2.1 pct in 1986.    "Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factorsbehind the avoidance of recession," the report said.    The current account balance of payments deficit is expectedto be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, afterhitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.    In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightlyto around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but willstill be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation isexpected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year,unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pctthis year.    Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink toaround four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at aboutthat level in 1988. Reuter
JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS Japan could avoid a sharp rise in thevalue of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. Andother nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, anadvisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency(EPA) said.    The advisory body said in its report that the yen wouldsoar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a globalbasis were delayed.    An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall toslightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed torestructure their economies.    The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cutJapan's current account surplus to two pct of gross nationalproduct (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a changewould slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annuallyduring the seven-year period to 1993.    If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollarwould remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan'scurrent-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993.

AFRICAN RESERVE BANK SAYS GROWTH RATE ON TARGET South Africa recorded annualisedreal growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of thisyear and the economy should achieve the government's target ofthree pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.    The South African central bank said in its quarterlybulletin that confidence in the economy improved from Januaryto May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in thenation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvementin the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.    It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in thethird and fourth quarters of last year.    It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreementreached with international creditors in March as evidence ofimproved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.    The accord effectively extends a moratorium on mostrepayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short termforeign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.    South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualisedsurplus on the current account of the balance of payments of7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplusof 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninthconsecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985. REUTER
ITALY DEFICIT NOT DUE TO LIBERALIZATION-MINISTER Italy's Foreign Trade Minister MarioSarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press,said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not beattributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreignsecurities.    Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month'soverall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decreeabolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreignsecurities purchases.   "The deficit can be better attributed to premature anddelayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags)rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment," Sarcinellisaid in a statement.    Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks bythe Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and saidit had been partly caused by "non-banking capital outflows."    "In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flowof capital to foreign securities or investments outside ourborders," said the newspaper.    But the newspaper added that it was still not possible tosay how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchasedeposits had affected Italy's balance of payments. Reuter
 German May current account surplus 7.5 billi Ivory Coast rainfall this season hasbeen less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffeeproduction has not suffered, the official Ivorian dailyFraternite Matin reported.    The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dryconditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant ifthere is good rainfall in coming weeks.    Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowestin northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop hasespecially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matinsaid.    Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier thismonth 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.    Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculturehad been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does notneed very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants havebeen affected in some regions, it added.    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It describedearly development of the new main crop as patchy.    The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this yearforecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coastdue to drought in the western part of the country. It estimatedthe crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's4.33 mln bag harvest.    Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffeecrop as "normal." REUTER

TURKEY CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT WIDENS IN JULY Turkey's current account deficit widenedin July to 674 mln dlrs from 454 mln in June but fell from 1.22billion in July last year, the State Statistics Institute said.    The cumulative trade position in July showed a 1.85 billiondlr deficit after 1.33 billion in June and 1.89 billion a yearearlier, with exports at 4.91 billion and imports, both FOB, at6.76 billion.    The government aims to narrow the current account deficitfor the whole of 1987 to 975 mln dlrs, compared with 1.52billion last year, up from 1.01 billion in 1985.    Bankers forecast the 1987 deficit will exceed one billiondlrs,  because a spurt in exports is expected to slowconsiderably in the last five months following a massivedrawdown of inventories. REUTER
S.KOREA CURRENT A/C SURPLUS SEEN NEAR 10 BLN DLRS South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap,said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billiondlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for thecountry's cheap cars and electronic goods.    Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny theYonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its ownfigures later in the week.    Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the currentaccount, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled7.03 billion dlrs.    This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for thewhole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks withthe International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapidrevaluation of the won against the dollar.    The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.    "Exports in October could be relatively modest due to manypublic holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus willbe well over nine billion dollars, close to ten," Yonhap said.    The sharp rise in the September surplus came from aresumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previousmonth.    More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrestbetween July and September.    The South Korean government originally targeted a fivebillion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raisethis to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half exportboom.    If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplusseemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the UnitedStates which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit withSeoul last year, government economists said.    The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressureat home, has called on South Korea to open more markets toAmerican goods and revalue the won faster.    The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday,representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year. REUTER
HIGHER SPENDING EXPECTED IN MALAYSIA'S 1988 BUDGET Malaysia's recovery from the worstrecession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when thegovernment announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988after seven years of austerity, economists said.    "Our country is walking on one leg now," said Ismail Salleh,an economist with the Institute of Strategic and InternationalStudies. "It has to depend on public sector investment forfaster growth if the private sector is not moving."    Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinkingone pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.    The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be undertwo pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pctbecause prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin andsemiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.    The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billionringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.    Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pctin 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.    Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmenblaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.    One businessman said too many politicians give theimpression that Malaysia was unstable.    "If we can take care of investment confidence, the potentialto recover strongly is great," a banker said.    Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in theblack with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgitsurplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.    The government has said its fiscal policies will balancethe budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.    The government will also repay some of its external debt,which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.    Political leaders have said the budget will not hurtordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essentialgoods are unlikely to change.    Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut thecorporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia tocompete for investors with neighbouring states. REUTER
