CANADA CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT UP IN QUARTER Canada's current account deficit widenedto a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourthquarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third,Statistics Canada said.    The shortfall for the full year rose to 8.81 billion dlrsfrom 1985's 584 mln dlr deficit, the federal agency said.    The agency said the rise in the merchandise surplus, to2.77 billion dlrs from 2.20 billion dlrs in the third quarter,was more than offset by high deficits in servicies andinvestment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs.    The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourthquarter of 1985.

DUTCH CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS FALLS IN 1986 The Dutch current account surplus fell5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billionguilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.    The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, thestatement said, but gave no details. Earlier today, theofficial planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus tofall to six billion guilders during 1987.    The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining termsof exchange, while more goods were imported as consumerspending and investment increased.    While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billionguilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporaryimprovements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delaybetween the fall in oil and gas prices.    The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit oninvisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the FinanceMinistry said, noting the surplus on transport services wasreduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil pricefalls.    The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, forthe first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said. REUTER
ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT UP China's foreign debt reached 27 billiondlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure toshort-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains verycreditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreignbankers and Chinese officials told Reuters.    Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply froman estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increasedimport commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low,between eight and 10 pct.    China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.    Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relationsand Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loanagreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.    Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs inthe 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers saidthey estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.    A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too muchshort-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as aresult of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractivelow interest rates in the Japanese market.    The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and islikely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.    A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of thecountry's total debt at about 30 pct.    The Peking representative of a Japanese securities housesaid the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.    "Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China,which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to goelsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread," hesaid.    The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans isin part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capitalmarkets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.    "Officials do not think of China but of their own departmentor firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have thefull backing of the People's Republic of China," he said.    "The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in otherareas, is to balance central control with giving reasonableautonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms toexercise indirect controls," he said.    The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over thepast six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not beaffected by a drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrasemeaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal ofCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.    A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China'sforeign exchange reserves have fallen below the officiallystated figure of 10 billion dlrs.    "The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in themarket, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily inadvance of an announcement the reserves were down," he said.    The banker said such buying has not been going on. "Thingsare normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development."    Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.    A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade officialsaid this year's outlook for exports, which account for morethan 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthierthan a year ago.    The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. Itwas quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago.    The official said China has taken measures to improve itsexport performance, including incentive offers to exporters andthe establishment of export production bases.    "We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year," headded.    Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from thedrop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs.    A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs carefulmanagement but its debt service ratio remains very low at sixto eight pct.    "We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchangereserves but on its export performance, just as you assess acompany on its performance, not its bank account," he said.    He said China performed very well in the export field lastyear and remains a very creditworthy country which will havefew difficulties in increasing its borrowing. REUTER

FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA JUMPS IN LAST QTR The net inflow of foreign investmentinto Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarterof 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billiona year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said.    The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billionturnaround in direct investment.    The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billioninflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account ofgovernment foreign currency borrowings, it said.    Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billiondlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal inthe third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourthquarter of 1985, the Bureau said.    It said the major part of the turnaround reflected aninjection of funds, estimated at around 700 mln dlrs,associated with the previously reported restructuring of theAustralian operations of General Motors Corp <GM>.    GM used the funds to pay out or take over certainAustralian liabilities of its local unit <GeneralMotors-Holden's Ltd>, it said.    However, net borrowings remained the major part of totalinflow, accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarteragainst 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion ayear earlier, the Bureau said.    Net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs againsta net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mlninflow a year earlier.

DANISH CREDIT DOWNGRADING NOT DRAMATIC - MINISTER Finance Minister Palle Simonsen saidtoday's downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by Standard andPoor's Corp should not be over-dramatised.    Standard and Poor's said it had downgraded the Kingdom ofDenmark's long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, followingthe country's loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983.    "This change is regrettable but there is no reason todramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor'sdefines the AA category as only slightly different from the topAAA rating," Simonsen said in a statement.    "The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowingcapability is unlikely to be very great. But if, againstexpectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external accountdeficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms andcapability," he added.    "Standard &amp; Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a seriesof austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending andencourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect.    "If and when it becomes necessary, the government will beready to take any necessary economic and political initiativesas it has in the past," Simonsen said.   Standard and Poor's said weaker internationalcompetitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean adeteriorating current account balance and a rise in externaldebt.    The external current account deficit rose to a recordpreliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns,according to government statistics.    Government economists forecast that the external currentaccount deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year.

 German Feb current account surplus 6.6 billion marks (Jan surplus 4.8 billion) -  West Germany's current accountsurplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in Februaryfrom a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, aspokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.    The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.    The Statistics Office had originally put the Januarycurrent account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.    The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billionmark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the currentaccount surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplusrecorded in February 1986.    A Statistics Office statement said the widening of theFebruary current account surplus compared with January was dueto seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current accountfigures are seasonally adjusted.    February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.    Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pctcompared with January.    The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculatethe real change in exports and imports in February. But forcomparison purposes it noted that in January the average valueof imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the averagevalue of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.    Within the current account, the services account had 300mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln marksurplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion markdeficit.    Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports invalue terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with ayear earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.    The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks forJanuary/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1billion marks in the year-ago period.    The cumulative current account surplus for January andFebruary 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billionmarks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.    Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplusreflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well asseasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlierthis week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct againstJanuary while export prices were unchanged.    "The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trendthat is not expected to change for several months at least,"said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said thesurplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.    An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) inFrankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave amore accurate picture of West Germany's trade position.    He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January andFebruary together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplusposted in November and December.    "The trend is clearly lower," he said.    This economist, who declined to be named, said the Februaryrise was also partly explained by special factors in January,when there had been a number of public holidays as well asextremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.

SOUTH KOREA TO CHANGE POLICIES TO AVERT TRADE WAR South Korea has decided on major changesin its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducingthe growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding atrade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister KimMahn-je said.    Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exportscould make South Korea too reliant on exports, increasenflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, whichmeans abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreigndebt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.    Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said thecurrent account surplus, previously expected to exceed eightbillion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billiondlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisationand rationalising exports.    He said Seoul would try to limit its current accountsurplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next fewyears, although trade volume would continue to grow.    "This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP(gross national product) from the current five pct level tothree pct by 1991," he added.    Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreigndebt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the endof 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5billion dlrs at end-1986.    "But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected toremain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lowerthan the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs," he said.    The policy change was announced two days before thescheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigefor talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.    South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateraltrade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.    Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swingin South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billiondlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mlndlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.    The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, rawmaterials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.    "The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), areconsiderable incentives given to increase imports," Koo said.    Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency."It means they could become interest-free loans if the Koreancurrency continues to rise in value," he said.    He said the South Korean won would be revalued against thedollar gradually, but added "We do not believe in rapid one-shotchanges in the value of the won."    The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen sixpct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986. REUTER

KEATING REVISES 1986/87 AUSTRALIA PAYMENTS DEFICIT Treasurer Paul Keating said he nowexpected the Australian current account deficit for fiscal1986/87 ending June 30 to come in around 13.25 billion dlrs.    In a statement released after Statistics Bureau figuresshowed the May deficit was below forecasts at 866 mln dlrs,Keating said the cumulative deficit is now likely to be about1.5 billion dlrs below the Treasury forecast of 14.75 billionissued with the 1986/87 Budget papers last August.    However, the government had subsequently revised theforecast to around 13.75 billion dlrs after a series of currentaccount figures indicated a declining trend.    Keating's revised 1986/87 current account deficit forecastcompares with a record shortfall of 14.40 billion dlrs in1985/86, a level nearly double the 7.29 billion deficitrecorded only two years earlier in 1983/84.    Keating said the main reason for his revision was abetter-than-expected export performance.

 German May current account surplus 7.5 billi Ivory Coast rainfall this season hasbeen less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffeeproduction has not suffered, the official Ivorian dailyFraternite Matin reported.    The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dryconditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant ifthere is good rainfall in coming weeks.    Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowestin northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop hasespecially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matinsaid.    Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier thismonth 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.    Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculturehad been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does notneed very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants havebeen affected in some regions, it added.    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It describedearly development of the new main crop as patchy.    The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this yearforecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coastdue to drought in the western part of the country. It estimatedthe crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's4.33 mln bag harvest.    Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffeecrop as "normal." REUTER

S.KOREA CURRENT A/C SURPLUS SEEN NEAR 10 BLN DLRS South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap,said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billiondlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for thecountry's cheap cars and electronic goods.    Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny theYonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its ownfigures later in the week.    Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the currentaccount, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled7.03 billion dlrs.    This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for thewhole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks withthe International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapidrevaluation of the won against the dollar.    The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.    "Exports in October could be relatively modest due to manypublic holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus willbe well over nine billion dollars, close to ten," Yonhap said.    The sharp rise in the September surplus came from aresumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previousmonth.    More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrestbetween July and September.    The South Korean government originally targeted a fivebillion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raisethis to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half exportboom.    If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplusseemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the UnitedStates which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit withSeoul last year, government economists said.    The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressureat home, has called on South Korea to open more markets toAmerican goods and revalue the won faster.    The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday,representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year. REUTER
