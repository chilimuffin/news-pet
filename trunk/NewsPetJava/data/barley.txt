TRADERS DETAIL FRENCH CEREAL EXPORT REQUESTS French operators last Friday requestedlicences to export 10,500 tonnes of free market maize, 11,950tonnes of free market barley and 13,000 of soft wheat flour tonon-EC countries, at prefixed daily (droit commun) rebates,French trade sources said.    The latest requests for the maize were for export toSwitzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebateprefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20Ecu daily rebate.    The special daily rebate for maize was set in the contextof a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for theexport of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries,in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recentdispute over grain sales to Spain.    If the latest French requests are accepted as expected,this will bring the total of French maize exported in thiscontext to 25,500 tonnes.    The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for thesale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.    Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austriaand Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixedrestitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheatflour were for export to various non-EC countries at anunchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.

U.K. WHEAT AND BARLEY EXPORTS ADJUSTED UPWARDS The U.K. Exported 535,460 tonnes of wheatand 336,750 tonnes of barley in January, the Home Grown CerealsAuthority (HGCA) said, quoting adjusted Customs and Excisefigures.    Based on the previous January figures issued on February 9,wheat exports increased by nearly 64,000 tonnes and barley byabout 7,000 tonnes.    The new figures bring cumulative wheat exports for theperiod July 1/February 13 to 2.99 mln tonnes, and barley to2.96 mln compared with 1.25 and 1.89 mln tonnes respectively ayear ago.    January wheat exports comprised 251,000 tonnes to EuropeanCommunity destinations and 284,000 tonnes to third countries.    The Soviet Union was prominent in third countrydestinations, taking 167,700 tonnes while Poland was creditedwith 54,500 and South Korea 50,000 tonnes. Italy was thelargest EC recipient with 75,000 tonnes followed by WestGermany with 55,200 and France 52,000 tonnes.    Barley exports for January comprised 103,700 tonnes to theEC and 233,000 to third countries. The Soviet Union was thelargest single importer with 133,265 tonnes followed by SaudiArabia with 53,800 tonnes. Reuter
ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC The size of French 1986/87 carryoverbarley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French CerealsIntervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.    He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at theend of February from the previous month while export forecastswere lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.    Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding alarger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets areopened for French barley a large amount could be put intointervention.    A small amount of French barley has already been put intointervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.    The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exportsto non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in1985/86.    The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decisionto hold special export tenders for French maize, he said. Reuter

AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92 A 0/92 program would have verylittle impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle onlyan additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, accordingto a report from the Agriculture Department.    The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acresidled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mlndlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.    The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.    "The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause verylarge acreages to be removed from crop production is quitesmall," the report said.    "The returns on typical farms still favor participation inthe usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permittedacreage," the USDA report said.    The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to foregoplanting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,would be most used by producers in high production/high riskareas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,director of USDA's economics analysis staff.    "In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that muchparticipation," Collins said.    USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheatwould be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.    Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushelsof sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales ofcotton, the report said.    "In determining whether to participate, a producer wouldneed to weigh the expected cash costs of production against theloan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above theexpected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must beconsidered," according to the analysis.    "What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference betweenthe loan rate and the cost of production," Collins said.    For producers with low production costs, that difference isgreater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go alongwith 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be moreattractive.    Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would bemore incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.    "I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal atfirst, but it is a step towards the goal of separatingproduction decisions from government payments," Collins said.    In a speech earlier today before the National Grains andFeed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is toolate to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup willbe over by the end of this month.

Soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of thenon-program crop acreage enrolled, a USDA analyst said. Heavyenrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a bigpercentage would be fallow and non-soybean land, accounted fora large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said.

WEST GERMAN BARLEY, RAPE AFFECTED BY WINTER KILL Winter kill has probably affected WestGerman winter barley and rapeseed to an above average degreethis season, West German grain trader Alfred C. Toepfer said inits latest report.    It is too soon to assess the extent of the damage, but itis likely that northern West German crops are particularly atrisk because of insufficient snow cover, it said.

RAINS PROMISE BOUNTIFUL CROPS IN ETHIOPIA Rain over wide areas has raised theprospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffereda disastrous drought and famine two years ago.    Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's AgricultureDevelopment Department, told reporters prospects were good forattaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the presentgrowing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.    Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnesa year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the "belg"(small) rains which fall at this time of year.    The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops likemaize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affectsproduction in the main rainy season, because farmers eat theirstocks of seed.    Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regionswhich suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sowtheir crops because of the favourable rains.    The government had distributed large quantities of seed andfertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop. Reuter

FRENCH WINTER CEREAL SOWING SEEN LITTLE CHANGED The Ministry of Agriculture left itsestimates of French winter cereal sowings for the 1986/87campaign barely changed at 6.606 mln hectares compared with itsprevious forecast of 6.601 mln.    This compared with the 6.41 mln ha of winter cerealsharvested in the 1985/86 campaign.    Winter soft wheat sowings were put at 4.647 mln ha comparedwith its previous estimate of 4.651 mln and 4.57 mln haharvested last campaign. Winter barley plantings were forecastat 1.46 mln ha, unchanged from its previous estimate andcompared with 1.41 mln harvested last season.    The ministry put hard winter wheat sowings at 246,000 haversus a February 1 estimate of 236,000 and actual areaharvested last campaign of 217,000.    Winter rape plantings were forecast at 627,000 ha against aprevious estimate of 621,000 and 375,000 rpt 375,000 harvestedin 1985/86. Reuter
MANITOBA SEEDINGS PROGRESS WELL IN DRY WEATHER The Manitoba Agriculture Departmentweekly crop report said no measurable precipitation wasreported across the province in the past week, allowing smallgrain seedings to progress rapidly across the south, with fieldpreparation under way in the northern growing regions.    Small grains should be seeded across the Province in one totwo weeks, assuming weather remains dry.    Planting progress was most advanced in the southeast, with30 pct of the spring wheat acres and 40 pct of the barley acresseeded. Cereals plantings were well under way in the southcentral part of the province, with seedings spotty so far inthe southwest.    Summer fallow acres should be in line with the latestStatistics Canada projections, the report said. Reuter
WEST GERMAN TAPIOCA USE SEEN DECLINING West German use of tapioca is likely todecline further despite favourable prices and import licencesfor only 420,000 tonnes have been registered since the start ofthe current agricultural year, compared with 640,000 tonnesduring August/April the previous year, trade sources said.    The 12 European Community (EC) countries have licensed atotal of 4.22 mln tonnes, while at the same year-earlier periodthe EC contracted for 3.17 mln tonnes, they said.    The Netherlands is registering an increase in licences toaround 2.9 mln tonnes, up 400,000 tonnes from last year, theysaid.    Total EC tapioca imports during the current agriculturalyear are expected to stagnate at last year's level of around6.0 mln tonnes, the sources said.    They reported a rise in consumption and in import licencesfor France, Spain and Belgium but said the West German compoundfeed industry was increasingly using grain in feed mixtures.    Sellers quoted tapioca for nearby delivery at around 27marks per 100 kilos against 37 marks in March and 34 marks inApril last year.    Feed barley was quoted at about 42 marks per 100 kilos,resulting in higher West German feed stuff prices, but demandwas seen as slack.    The sources said the West German feed industry was tryingto help cut the grain surplus through increased use of grain infeed mixtures.    Other EC member countries are likely to take advantage ofthe lower tapioca prices, they said. REUTER
