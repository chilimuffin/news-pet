BANKERS SEE SHARP RISE IN THAI FOREIGN RESERVES Thailand's improving economy will likelycause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billiondlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion atend-February, private bankers said.    Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.    Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the <Bangkok BankLtd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relativelyhigh interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market,and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan,contributed to the projected sharp rise.    Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected toexpand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.    A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand couldachieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, upfrom a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.    Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at itscurrent pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stablethe five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.    Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold,special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The targetis equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports. REUTER
U.K. RESERVES SHOW UNDERLYING RISE IN FEBRUARY Britain's gold and currency reservesshowed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.    The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of Englandoperations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net ofborrowings and repayments.    This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.    The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunityof strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumnand said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.    Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.    Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, whilerepayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, aTreasury spokesman said.    Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January,capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuationchange that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to thequarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fundswap.    The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England'smarket operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bankof England intervention to curb upward pressure on the poundtoday.    A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures,said that the government does not want sterling either to risetoo far or to fall substantially from current levels.

FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES FALL SHARPLY IN JANUARY French official reserves fell 45.06billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministrysaid in a statement.    It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreigncurrency that preceded the January 11 realignment of theEuropean Monetary System (EMS).    Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francsduring the month, the ministry said.    This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs throughoperations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting fromthe quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits heldwith the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).    But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion francdeficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as aresult of using very short-term financing instruments.    The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank andother central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchangemarkets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, inan attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flightof funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up thefranc.    On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct againstthe French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.    The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reservesto 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74billion at end December.    Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.    Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billionfrancs from 75.27 billion at end December.    Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mlnfrancs to 19.31 billion francs. REUTER

HUNGARY HOPES DEVALUATION WILL END TRADE DEFICIT National Bank of Hungary firstvice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pctdevaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress lastyear's severe trade deficit with the West.    Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve atleast equilibrium on its hard currency trade.    "It is useful to have a devaluation," he said. "There is now areal push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports."    The official news agency MTI said today Hungary woulddevalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to beannounced later today. Fekete said the rates would come intoeffect tomorrow.    He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary hada higher rate of inflation over the past two years than itsmain partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and5.5 pct in 1986).    This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took toprevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks ofthe 1970s, he added.    Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and bybetween three and four pct early last year.    But the country's hard currency trade balance neverthelessfell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.    Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency tradesurplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that amore likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on totalhard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.    One Western commercial attache here said: "Devaluation ofitself will not change anything. It will only be useful if theyalso make efforts to restructure industry and improve thequality of their export goods."    Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms thisyear to invest in restructuring industry.    It would be his role to persuade international banks tocooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given anAA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samuraibond market.    Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billiondlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of acurrent account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly becausethe fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debtdenominated in marks or yen.    He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly thisyear, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose ofmodernisation.    "I am for credits to invest for that purpose," he said. "I amagainst credits for consumption." He forecast gross domesticproduct growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.   Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debtprofile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium termloans with cheaper long term money for which it was lookingmore and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where heconsidered rates to be low.    Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay ataround 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, whichtripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year afterquadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry wasworking out measures to reduce an approved target deficit forthis year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billionforints.

 German net currency reserves rise 400 mln marks to 87.0 billion - Bu Indonesia's coffee production in1986/87 ending September 30 may fall slightly from last year'slevel of 360,000 tonnes, Dharyono Kertosastro, chairman of theAssociation of Indonesian Coffee Exporters told Reuters.    He said shade trees had been damaged by pests and this mayhave affected the crop, though it remains to be seen howseriously. Indonesia's main crop is harvested next month.    He gave no figure for expected output, except to say itwould probably be down a little from 1985/86. He said stockswere about normal at 90,000 tonnes.    Kertosastro predicted that exports were unlikely to risemuch from last year's level of 320,000 tonnes. "I expect exportswill be a bit more, maybe 330,000 tonnes, but not above that,"he said. Exports in 1985/86 were valued at 944 mln U.S. Dlrs,but the value could fall by 30 pct this year because of lowprices, he added.    Dharyono said production was behind a five year plan targetof 420,000 tonnes for the current year, but Indonesia is tryingto boost output through introduction of higher yielding seeds,better training for farmers and increased use of fertilizers.

TAIWAN CLAMPS NEW CONTROLS ON CURRENCY INFLOWS Taiwan's new controls on currencyinflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a floodof speculative money prompted by the local currency surgeagainst the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said.    The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding onemln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance andbank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from anyother source.    Petitioners have to show their remittances relate togenuine commercial transactions.    Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report alloutward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight,insurance and royalties, to the central bank.    But bankers said they believed the new controls would beineffective since businessmen could split up remittances intosmaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan'sflourishing currency black market.    The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are apanic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over thepast week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar toslow the growth of Taiwan's exports to the U.S.    The government has denied local press reports Washington ispressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs.    The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70.    "I don't think the central bank has a final target," said anexecutive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists saidthey are wary of making any firm predictions about how far theTaiwan dollar will rise.    Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S.Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surpluswidened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billiondlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year.    Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculativemoney flowed into Taiwan in 1986.    This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to morethan 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time lastyear and provided further upward pressure on the currency.    The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct againstthe U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouragingspeculators.    Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last weekWashington's pressure plus rising foreign exchange reservesmeant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable.    Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to thecurrency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allowthe local dollar to find its own level.    "Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but thecentral bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not wantto take the risk," said one local banker.    He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporarymeasure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples withthe exchange rate problem.    The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirtaround the real issue, he said.    Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreignexchange controls, said an executive with a western bank.    "The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bankcharges will not outweigh the profits of speculation," said themanager of a European bank.    Economists criticised the controls, saying they couldantagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economicliberalisation in Taiwan.    "Instead of liberalising outflows, the government hasrestricted inflows," said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickersda Costa.    A local banker, who declined to be named, said, "It'sbasically ridiculous. It's a backward movement and goes againstthe government's liberalisation programme."    Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations toenable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds,treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allowindividuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the countryeach year.

BOLIVIA TO OFFER TO BUY BACK BANK DEBT Bolivia is to make a formal offer duringthe next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt fromcommercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bankpresident Jier Nogales said.     Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steeringcommittee of Bolivia's creditor banks had agreed to considerthe offer at a meeting in New York last month.     He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivianpaper on the international secondary debt market, where it nowtrades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value.    Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy backits commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid thediscounted rate in full.    Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to30 years at interest rates below those fixed in theinternational markets, he added.    Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loansto commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said therewould be no money available to restart traditional debtservicing to them for some time.     Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes tocancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs,but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make aformal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt atdiscounted rates.    Nogales said practical and strategic considerations woulddetermine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made inthe next few months.     He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks overthe price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would makea single non-negotiable offer.    He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendlycreditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The onlytraditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which wouldmean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater lossprovisions, he added.    "We are confident that the banks are going to bereasonable," Nogales said. "Now they can resolve their problemsfor once and for all."    "The most conservative ones who want a little more willwait a year, but I don't know if the window of opportunity willbe open all the time," he added.    Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia's fourbillion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed togovernments and the rest to international agencies, Nogalessaid negotiators had achieved considerable success in recentdiscussions with the Paris Club.     He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to rescheduleBolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, whileaccepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interestrates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under ParisClub rules, he added.     He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregardpenalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing withArgentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt.    He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans frominternational agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400mln dlrs in disbursements this year.    The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changedfrom a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflowof 130 mln dlrs last year, he added.    Nogales said that Bolivia's net international reserves nowstood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs indisposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssorotook office in August, 1985.    Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct ayear in the government's first month in office, was now down to10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and theplan was that it should continue at this level.    He said the government was also expecting at least threepct growth in gdp this year after several years of negativerates. Reuter

TAIWAN SAID CONSIDERING CURRENCY LIBERALISATION Taiwan's central bank is consideringproposals to ease currency restrictions to reduce foreignexchange reserves of 51 billion U.S. Dlrs, a local newspaperreported today.    The China Times, which has close ties with the government,quoted central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng as saying thegovernment had agreed in principle to liberalise financialrestrictions.    The bank was considering proposals to allow firms andindividuals to hold foreign exchange and invest in foreignstocks for the first time, Chang was quoted as saying.    All foreign exchange must now be handed to local banks andexchanged for local currency. Firms and individuals may onlyinvest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills andcertificates of deposit.    Central bank and other government officials were notavailable to comment on the report.    Economists said it was likely that the government wouldease foreign exchange controls, but only gradually.    They said vast foreign currency reserves, earned mainlyfrom huge trade surpluses with the United States, made Taiwan atarget for U.S. Protectionism.    Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 13.6 billionU.S. Dlrs last year compared with 10.2 billion in 1985.    "The central bank has to go in this direction," said SuHan-min, chief economist with the International Commercial Bankof China.

MEXICO'S RESERVES REACH EIGHT BILLION DLRS Additional capital inflows of 1.5billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves toabout eight billion dlrs, director of public credit AngelGurria told reporters.    Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improvedinvestor confidence and because a tight monetray policy hasforced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflowstotalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986.    Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for thesake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool offunds available for badly needed investment.    Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan isdrawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only haveenough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four orfive months, Gurria noted.    Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw onthe commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-supportcontingency facility. That money will be available until April1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fallbelow certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for thefirst two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria saidtoday, "We expect we'll never have to use it."    Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw onthe second contingency facility included in the bank financingpackage - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the WorldBank.    Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signedyesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support thedevelopment of exports of manufactured goods.    He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billiondlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil andexport promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month.    Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from itsInternational Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few daysbased on a successful review of end-1986 economic results.    Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages ofdiscussions which will determine quantitative economic targetsfor 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMFfor the rest of 1987.    Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eightbilateral accords with government creditors within the ParisClub.    Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrellaagreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrsof official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalizepacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks.    In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, hesaid all countries from the Organization of EconomicCooperation and Development have continued to provide exportcredit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.

TAIWAN COMPLAINS ABOUT SIZE OF RESERVES Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves,swollen by strong trade surpluses to a record 53 billion U.S.Dlrs, are becoming a problem, government officials said.    Official figures show the latest level compares with theprevious record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26billion in late March 1986.    Central bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters theincrease in reserves was the result of heavy intervention bythe bank on the local interbank market. It bought nearly twobillion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23, he said.    Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Councilfor Economic Planning and Development, told Reuters the risingreserves were "a big headache for Taiwan."    He said the government expects heavier pressure from theU.S., Where protectionist bills are being proposed againstnations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluseswith the U.S.    Wang said the government would launch new measures withinthe next two months to further reduce import tariffs and openthe market wider to foreign products, especially those from theU.S.    Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan's tradesurplus, which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first twomonths of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. Nearly 90 pctof the surplus was with the U.S.    Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang'sremarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism wererunning out of time. "We must do it quickly or face retaliationfrom Washington," he said.    He said the measures would include removal of tradebarriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies.    Chang Chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buyingU.S. Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fearthe strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses.    He said the bank is studying revision of the foreignexchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls,but declined to give details.    The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the U.S.Dollar since September 1985.

SOUTH AFRICA GDP UP 4.7 PCT IN 1986 LAST QUARTER The South African Reserve Bank,confirming previous estimates, said real gross domestic productin the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annualrate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pctin the 1985 final quarter.    The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominalgrowth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a1.5 pct contraction in 1985.    But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade istaken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pctcompared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985.    GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by aneconomy but omits income from abroad.  GNP includes suchpayments or outflows.    The bank also said there were indications the country'seconomic recovery was becoming more broadly based.    With the exception of commerce all major sectors of theeconomy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domesticproduction.    The bank said major increases in foreign reserves wererecorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987.Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February.    Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the totalannual value of import payments.    The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion randin 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year.    The bank said continuing strength of the current accounthas allowed foreign reserves to be "rebuilt to more comfortablelevels."

 UK reserves rise underlying 1.785 billion dlrs in March -  The new Singapore governmentsecurities market will start trading in late April or early Mayafter President Wee Kim Wee signs the Development Loan Billapproved by parliament last week, bankers said.    But the new market is unlikely to attract many overseasinvestors, particularly as non-residents will be subject to awithholding tax on interest earned, Loh Hoon Sun, generalmanager of <Overseas Union Bank Ltd>, said.    Overseas Union Bank Ltd is one of the five primary dealersapproved to underwrite the auctions and ensure liquidity.    The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which approvedthe five underwriters, aims to issue seven billion dlrs oftreasury bills, notes and bond issues in the first year.    A MAS spokesman said a steering committee has yet todetermine details, but most of the new government securitieswill have a maturity of up to five years and 10-year paper maybe issued if demand emerges. Bonds and treasury bills will beissued in denominations of 1,000 dlrs and treasury bills in aminimum denomination of 10,000 dlrs.    Bankers said these rates will put the securities withinreach of almost everyone and will create a more active market.    Allocations will be made first for non-competitive bidsfrom primary dealers prepared to accept average yields on up to500,000 dlrs worth of notes and bonds and an unlimited volumeof treasury bills. The remainder will be awarded to competitivebidders offering the lowest yields.    The new market should stimulate the local economy. Fundswill come from savings and fixed deposit accounts, "but just howmuch will depend on the bond yields," Loh told Reuters.    Loh said bank interest rates currently stand at 3.0 to 3.5pct for fixed deposits and the prime rate is 5.5 pct, and theserates are expected to remain fairly steady this year.

DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT RISES IN WEEK Loans and advances from the DutchCentral Bank to the commercial banks rose by 1.2 billionguilders to 10.7 billion in the week up to and including April6, the Bank's weekly return showed.    Paper discounted with the Bank also rose, by 477 mlnguilders to 916 mln.

The Bank's gold and currency reserves rose by 484 mln to56.89 billion guilders, while the value of non-gold holdingsrose by 140 mln guilders, analysts said.

EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE European currency markets reacted quietlyto the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealersranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete tosurprise that the markets should have expected so much.    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currenciesand traded in a narrow range after the communique, whichreaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currencystabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remainingbroadly entrenched in its current trading range.    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase BankAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.    However, she said the dollar could break out of the rangewith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltdin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady againstthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,possibly to 140 yen.    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expectsa dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curbunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negativesentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbankoperators to test the downside.    Concern that finance ministers and officials still inWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour ofcurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along withworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in thenear term, the traders said.    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at thecommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar'sdownward trend.    Traders in several centres said the market would look forfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks todefend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadlyconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policyintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." TheU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.    However, some dealers said London-based operators would beunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the longEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers saidthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stablemarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extremevolatility seen in the first few months of this year.    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of thecommunique made clear the leading nations did not want afurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvreaccord's supposed currency target range.    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets wereready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communiquecontributing to greater stability.    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a bigboost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said heexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marksin the next three months.    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, saidthe communique had been in line with realistic expectations andshould not have produced disappointment.    "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and tradepolicies to redress current imbalances are of a differenttimescale than currency markets operate on," the source toldReuters, "This is a political process which takes time."    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp inBasle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident oncurrency markets today. "Did people really expect a patentremedy?" he asked.    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was onlythe first in a series and said the market would watch carefullyin the next few weeks for any changes in positions.    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus wasnow on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move byJapan and West Germany to boost their economic growth couldlead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary inpushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming monthswhile central banks appear resolved to use their muscle tosupport the Paris accord.

CHINA TRADE DEFICIT FALLS SHARPLY, RESERVES RISE China's trade deficit in the firstquarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same1986 period, customs figures show.    Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau,quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.    He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items andmaterials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As aresult, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from theirlevel at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.    Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrsat end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.    Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improvedincentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retainmore foreign exchange from the goods they sell.    He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46billion.

WORLD BANK SUGGESTS MORE OPEN ECONOMY FOR INDIA The World Bank has suggested Indiashould move to a more open economy by gradually removing mostgovernment controls on industry and adopting a liberal externaltrade policy with reduced levels of protection.    A confidential "executive summary" of a draft Bank report onthe Indian economy was made available to Reuters. It suggestsliberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exportsof Indian goods by making them more competitive.    The summary said, "These reforms would result in (domestic)prices much more in line with world prices than is true today,and in a greater degree of import competition and exportrivalry than the nation has ever seen."    The summary said foreign trade must play a key role inIndia's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberalimports of capital goods would help modernise the economy andexpose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exportswould provide the foreign exchange for imports.    "The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the presentprinciple of unlimited protection for all indigenouslyavailable products and to recognise the role of actual orpotential competition from imports as a source of discipline onthe prices and costs of public and private sector domesticmanufacturers," the summary said.    An Indian official told Reuters the government wasdiscussing the report with the Bank. A final report with somechanges was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to givefurther details.    The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank'sfinal report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discussaid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June.    The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grewat an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and1986/87, which ended in March.    It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct ofgdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed bynational savings, mainly from the private sector.    India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowedto 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96billion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86.    But the summary said the improvement was largely due tolower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertiliserswhich make up the bulk of India's import bill.    India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreignexchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, thesummary said.    The Bank's summary said there was little room forcomplacency in the balance of payments position.    It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87,Indian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs.    Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct ayear in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viablebalance of payments, the summary said.    It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued.India "might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting whileundertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives thatinvolve some political costs," it said.    "An example of such a policy would be the adoption of anexchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability,"the summary said.    It said such an approach had been successful in countriessuch as South Korea, Colombia and Turkey. It would maintain thecompetitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduceimport pressures.    Earlier this year, the Indian government denied that theWorld Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boostexports. REUTER

TAIWAN CRITICISED FOR AMOUNT OF DOLLAR HOLDINGS About 20 members of the Taiwanparliament criticised the government for holding too much offoreign exchange reserves in U.S. Dollars and asked the cabinetto diversify these holdings into other major currencies.    A parliament statement said the criticism came from 18Kuomintang (nationalist) legislators and several oppositionmembers, who asked the government to diversify reserves intomark, yen, Swiss franc, other currencies or gold.    It said that from September 1985 to September 1986 thecentral bank's exchange rate loss was about 144 billion Taiwandlrs.    Fourteen local banks lost 12.6 billion Taiwan dlrs duringthe period, it said.    In the same time span the Taiwan dollar rose to 36.77 tothe U.S. Currency from 40.45. It closed at 33.17 today.    The statement said the central bank's loss this year wouldmore than double because of the rising Taiwan dollar andreserves, which had reached 54 billion U.S. Dlrs last week.    Government legislators said they expected the reserves toincrease to more than 60 billion U.S. Dlrs this year and thetrade surplus to increase by about 15 billion U.S. Dlrs,compared with 15.6 billion last year.

TAIWAN RESERVES RISE ON TRADE SURPLUS, SPECULATION Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves haverisen to a new high of 56 billion U.S. Dlrs, and officialsattribute the increase to a surging trade surplus and theinflux of speculative funds.    The reserves, up from 54 billion dlrs on April 19, comparewith 27.3 billion a year ago, the Central Bank said.    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-shien told Reuters: "Therising reserves will certainly intensify our trade frictionwith the U.S."    A central bank official, who declined to be named, saidTaiwan's trade surplus is expected to exceed 5.5 billion U.S.Dlrs in the first four months of 1987, against 4.25 billion ayear ago.    The influx of speculative funds, mainly from Hong Kong,Japan and the U.S., Also played a major role behind the rise ofthe reserves, he said, but declined to give figures.    Banking sources said almost 10 billion U.S. Dlrs hadentered Taiwan since early 1986. About three billion of thefunds were remitted through different channels, including theblack market, since the start of this year, they said.    Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Councilfor Economic Planning and Development, said he expects thereserves to rise in the next few months because of thecontinuing high level of Taiwan's exports and the steadyappreciation of the local dollar against the U.S. Currency.    "The latest government moves to open (the domestic) market,cut import tariffs and lift foreign exchange controls haveachieved little success," he said.    Vice economic minister Li Mo said tariffs were cut on some1,700 products in January and a further 862 this month in a bidto encourage more imports, especially the U.S.    More tariff cuts on about 300 imported products, includingtelevisions, video tape recorders, cosmetics and refrigeratorswill be announced in a month or two, Li said.    Li's colleague, Wang Chien-shien, said the government willsend several trade missions to the U.S. This year to buy aboutone billion U.S. Dlrs of products, including machinery, powerequipment, grains and precision tools.    "We earnestly hope to reduce our trade surplus with theU.S.," he said.    Taiwan's trade surplus rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S.Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985, and it widened to3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 against 2.78 billiona year ago, official statistics show.    The surplus has increased U.S. Pressure on Taiwan for afaster appreciation of its currency, which has risen by about18 pct since September 1985.    It opened at 33.10 to the U.S. Dollar today.

The new cd's, with maturities of six months, one and twoyears, bear interest of 4.03 to 5.12 pct.

TAIWAN CENTRAL BANK DEFENDS DOLLAR RESERVES POLICY Central Bank governor Chang Chi-chengdefended Taiwan's policy of holding a large amount of itsforeign exchange reserves in U.S. Dollars, citing similarpolicies followed by countries such as West Germany and Japan.    The reserves, now a record 56 billion U.S. Dlrs, are theworld's largest after those of West Germany and Japan. About 90pct is held in U.S. Dollars and the rest in yen and marks.    Chang's remarks to parliament were in response to a call onMonday by about 20 members of the parliament who asked thegovernment to diversify into other currencies, including yen,marks and Swiss francs because of exchange rate losses.    The legislators said the bank lost about 3.8 billion U.S.Dlrs between September 1985 and September 1986 as the Taiwandollar rose to 36.77 to the U.S. Dollar from 40.45.    They said they expected the losses to continue because ofthe rising Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Currency.    Chang said the central bank could not sell the U.S. Dollarslike other private banks or enterprises because such tradingwould be speculative and risky.    "The U.S. Dollar is an international currency and is widelyused among trading nations," he added.    Chang said the Central Bank has further revised foreignexchange rules, which would relax most controls or even suspendthem.    The revised rules have been submitted to the cabinet forapproval, he said. He declined to give details. REUTER
U.K. RESERVES RISE UNDERLYING 4.8 BILLION DLRS IN MAY, (2.9 BILLION APRIL) -  Britain's gold and currency reserves rosea record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April's2.9 billion dlrs increase, the Treasury said.    The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank ofEngland intervention on currency markets to curb sterling'sstrength. It was above market expectations which had been for arise of between one billion and three billion dlrs.    The Treasury declined comment on the figures.    Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, comparedwith April's 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April.    Borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mlndlrs, against April's 66 mln. Repayments under the scheme were85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repaymentsof eight mln, after three mln last month.    Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs.    The underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings andrepayments.    It was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrsrise seen in October 1977. The May increase represents theseventh monthly rise, with reserves up 9.947 billion dlrs inthat period, and up 9.816 billion since the start of 1987. REUTER
U.K. RESERVES LIFT HOPES OF FURTHER BASE RATE CUT The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for afurther cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11general election, market analysts said.    Sterling would have risen on the much better than expectednumber but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.    But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves nowavailable to the authorities to support the pound should curbany market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show theruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.    "We have been intervening to a very much greater extent thanwe have done hitherto," Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid at a news conference today, commenting on the news of therecord reserves rise.    He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvreaccord between leading industrial nations to stabilise thedollar, partly through direct intervention on foreignexchanges. "We have been playing a very full part ourselves," hesaid.    But market analysts see the recent upward pressure onsterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp downits rise, more in the light of local factors.    Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britainamid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears lastautumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.    U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreignbuyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields asattractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notablyequities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.    Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lowerinterest rates, as the government is expected to try to reversethe loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.    Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reservesnews, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket ofcurrencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.    "The market doesn't want to do anything because of theelection," commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.    Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts ofa rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs hadoverestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely tohave been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on theforward market.    The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount ofsterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooththe pound's sudden downturn, while some of the interventionreported in May probably occurred in April, they said.    The key three months interbank money market rates easedabout 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrendin U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reservesnews, analysts said.    Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market wasmuted as traders worried about the funding implications ofanother huge rise in reserves, they added.    Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cutfrom the current nine pct level soon after the election, solong as poll projections of another Conservative victory proveaccurate, with another half point later.    Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit SuisseBuckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might bepossible. "Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts infuture, rather than this active intervention," he predicted.    Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautionedagainst over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cutlooked likely.    A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.    "The Bank (of England) is both worried about the politicalproblem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... Andhas signalled some worry about broad money (growth)," said RobinMarshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.    He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves inthe past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into theEuropean Monetary System.    But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they didso. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in. REUTER

TAIWAN PARLIAMENT BACKS FREE CAPITAL OUTFLOWS Parliament approved a proposal to dropall controls on capital outflows, raising the prospect thatTaiwan's vast resevoir of foreign exchange will flow into theworld economy.    A government spokesman said the new law would bepromulgated by President Chiang Ching-Kuo within 10 days andfinancial authorities would then be empowered to lift controlson currency outflows at any time.    Tight restrictions on capital inflows introduced this yearwill remain in place, the spokesman said.    Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-Cheng has said the controlswill be lifted at the end of next month or early in August.    The central bank and finance ministry proposed liftingcurrency restrictions to help reduce Taiwan's foreign exchangereserves, which stand at about 60 billion U.S. Dlrs and haveled to runaway growth in money supply.    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan andWest Germany, also draw attention to Taiwan's huge tradesurplus and the government fears they are making the island atarget for U.S. Trade protectionism.    The surplus rose 34 pct to a record 7.32 billion U.S. Dlrsin the first five months of this year and about 90 pct of itwas with the United States.    Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.9 pct in theyear to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.    Local bankers and economists say when the controls arelifted, businessmen will be allowed to buy foreign currency andinvest it freely overseas. But they warn against expectationsof a sudden outflow of capital.    "I don't think we're going to see a big bang," John Brinsden,the Taiwan manager of Standard Chartered Bank told Reuters in arecent interview.    Bankers said that businessmen have been holding vastquantities of foreign exchange overseas for many years and alsohave been freely buying and exporting currency through aflourishing black-market.    "Obviously there will be an outflow of funds ... But I don'tthink it's going to be much," said Danny Chan, director ofFidelity Securities Investment Consulting Corp.    Economists say the success of plans to encourage capitaloutflow depend on whether the central bank can slow the rise ofthe local currency.    The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 23 pct against theU.S. Dollar since September 1983, prompting an inflow ofspeculative money. It rose by one Taiwan cent today to close at31.08.    The government spokesman said the new law does not empowerauthorities to permanently lift capital controls, but anyproposal to reimpose them would need the approval ofparliament.    Many economists believe that once the controls are liftedit will be almost impossible to reimpose them. REUTER
FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES 420.50 BILLION FRANCS I Vietnam's parliament sacked PrimeMinister Pham Van Dong and President Truong Chinh, but thechoice of their successors indicated the influence of the oldguard may not be over, diplomatic sources said.    Dong, prime minister for 32 years, left in fading health atthe age of 81. He is a popular hero of wars against France andthe United States and a staunch ally of the Soviet Union.    Parliament replaced him with second-ranked politburo memberPham Hung, 74, the Vietnam News Agency said. Hung headed theViet Cong guerrillas in the Vietnam War.    Diplomats in Bangkok said Hung, not a noted supporter ofeconomic and political reforms, had been widely tipped for theless important presidency.    That post went instead to Vo Chi Cong, a technocrat whoranks third in the politburo. Diplomatic sources said Cong wasmore in tune with the national economic and political changesbeing pushed by reformists who apparently had gained the upperhand in the all-important politburo in December.    Chinh, a hardline Marxist and a veteran of the wars againstFrance and the U.S., Was ousted at the age of 80. His politicalstance had recently softened, the sources said. REUTER

TAIWAN DOLLAR AND RESERVES SEEN RISING MORE SLOWLY Recent government moves to curb capitalinflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan'sforeign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollaragainst the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.    Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters thereserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past twoweeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against theU.S. Dollar.    Chang said, "The pace of increase in our reserves is muchslower now than before and our currency is getting more stable."He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surpluswith the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.Dlrs a month between January and May.    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan andWest Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.    On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings oflocal and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bankpurchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90pct of the value of a contract.    Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures haddrastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange toimporters and exporters.    They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollartransactions showed a drastic decline with some banksregistering a fall of up to 30 pct.    Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised againstthe U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanesecents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of fiveto eight cents in May.    The bank dealers said the central bank, which hadpreviously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercialdemand.    They said they expected the government to keep the localdollar stable in the near term to give breathing space tobusinesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise ofmore than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar sinceSeptember 1985.    The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,unchanged from yesterday.    Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,"It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflowis quite successful."    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slowerrise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure fromWashington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.    Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayedimports of machinery and production equipment because ofexchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange ratewould help boost imports, particularly from the United States. REUTER
