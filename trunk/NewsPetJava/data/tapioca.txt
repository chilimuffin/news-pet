EC FARM LIBERALISATION SEEN HURTING THAI TAPIOCA Any European Community decision toliberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapiocaindustry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at theThailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).    He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move tocut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops morecompetitive than tapioca in the European market.    The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing morethan two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported byThailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25mln tonnes a year until 1990.    Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariffloophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pctimport duty.    Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI,suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops.    He said: "If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they areclose to world prices, the tapioca market there will disappearcompletely."    He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because ithad recently joined other major commodity producers in callingon the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies. REUTER
WEST GERMAN TAPIOCA USE SEEN DECLINING West German use of tapioca is likely todecline further despite favourable prices and import licencesfor only 420,000 tonnes have been registered since the start ofthe current agricultural year, compared with 640,000 tonnesduring August/April the previous year, trade sources said.    The 12 European Community (EC) countries have licensed atotal of 4.22 mln tonnes, while at the same year-earlier periodthe EC contracted for 3.17 mln tonnes, they said.    The Netherlands is registering an increase in licences toaround 2.9 mln tonnes, up 400,000 tonnes from last year, theysaid.    Total EC tapioca imports during the current agriculturalyear are expected to stagnate at last year's level of around6.0 mln tonnes, the sources said.    They reported a rise in consumption and in import licencesfor France, Spain and Belgium but said the West German compoundfeed industry was increasingly using grain in feed mixtures.    Sellers quoted tapioca for nearby delivery at around 27marks per 100 kilos against 37 marks in March and 34 marks inApril last year.    Feed barley was quoted at about 42 marks per 100 kilos,resulting in higher West German feed stuff prices, but demandwas seen as slack.    The sources said the West German feed industry was tryingto help cut the grain surplus through increased use of grain infeed mixtures.    Other EC member countries are likely to take advantage ofthe lower tapioca prices, they said. REUTER
