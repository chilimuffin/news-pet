PAKISTAN COTTON OUTPUT REACHES 7.7 MLN BALES Pakistan cotton production during thecurrent crop season (Sept/March) reached 7.7 mln bales of 375pounds each, up 500,000 from last season, Shafi Niaz, Chairmanof the Agricultural Prices Commission, said.    Official sources said Pakistan was likely to use 3.4 mlnbales of cotton during the current financial year ending Juneafter 2.96 mln in 1985/86 and 2.70 mln in 1984/85.    They said consumption would increase due to a rise indemand for cotton yarn in domestic markets and abroad. Pakistanproduced 540 mln kilos of yarn in fiscal year 1985/86 andexported 157 mln.    The State-owned cotton export corporation was likely toexport 3.8 mln bales of cotton during the current fiscal yearcompared with 3.86 mln last year, cotton traders said.

S.KOREA TO BUY MORE COTTON, ESPECIALLY U.S. COTTON South Korea plans to import about 387,000tonnes of cotton this year compared to 225,000 tonnes in 1986,trade ministry officials said.    More than three quarters of the total, some 290,000 tonnes,will come from the United States. That will be a 93.7 pctincrease on 1986 when U.S. Imports totalled 150,000 tonnes, anofficial said.    He said the U.S. Increase is due partly to thecompetitiveness of American cotton and partly to efforts bySeoul to reduce its trade surplus with Washington.

CHINA TRYING TO INCREASE COTTON OUTPUT, PAPER SAYS China's 1987 cotton output must riseabove the 1986 level of 3.54 mln tonnes or supply will fallshort of increasing demand, the China Daily said.    Demand in 1986 rose 10.9 pct over 1985.    Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and arecord 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show. The China Dailyattributed the decline to several factors, including lessfavorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrictcotton production after the 1984 build-up of stocks.    According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985.    To increase output quickly, the state will raise by 10 pctthe price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quotalevels, the newspaper said. Its official purchasing agencieswill buy cotton produced in excess of that originallycontracted for, it added.    The China Daily said all cotton growing areas in southChina should be maintained, and growing in the north should beconcentrated in Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Xinjiang.    It called for comprehensive planning to coordinateproduction of cotton with that of grain, edible oil and othercrops, but gave no more details. REUTER

ISRAEL'S FIVE-YEAR PLAN TO BOOST AGRICULTURE Israel has drawn up a five-year planfor 1987-1991 to raise agricultural production by 500 mln dlrsto 2.7 billion dlrs, an annual rise of 3.4 pct, the IsraeliMinistry of Agriculture said. Agricultural exports are to beincreased by 180 mln dlrs, or 4.8 pct per year on average.    The area planted to cotton is to remain at the 1986 levelof 100,000 to 112,500 acres with exports expected to bring in80 to 90 mln dlrs per year. The 34 pct decline from the 1985level reflects continued water rationing which will remain inforce, the ministry said.    Groundnut production is planned to increase by 13,000tonnes, or 57 pct, by 1991 and exports by 9,000 tonnes, or 82pct. Maize production is targetted to rise by 48,000 tonnes, or48 pct, and exports by 34,000 tonnes, or 45 pct. Reuter

LITTLE RISK SEEN FOR TEXAS COTTON FROM COLD Texas' cotton crop stands littlechance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight inthat state, as very little cotton has been planted, accordingto Texas agricultural sources and cotton market analysts.    "It's still pretty early for cotton planting. Only six pctof the crop was planted as of last week," said Doug Stillmann,a statistician at the Texas Agricultural Statistic Service inAustin, a division of the U.S. Agriculture Department.    Stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting hadbegun in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas areas only, withplanting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated tobegin until next month. The high and low plains accounted for60 pct of the 2.5 mln bales produced in Texas last year,Stillmann said.    Temperatures tonight in most of Texas are expected to dropto freezing to the low 20s, although the lower Rio GrandeValley may see more moderate readings in the middle 30s,according to meteorologists at Accu-Weather Inc.

WEST TEXAS COTTON CROP UNSCATHED BY STORM The West Texas cotton crop was largelyunscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last nightthat packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather expertssaid.    "There might have been some isolated storms, but certainlynothing damaging," said Charles Stichler, an extensionagronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far WestTexas.    Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the NewYork cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.   Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25cents.    "What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, andwhen that happens, everybody sees it," said Dale Mohler, asenior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.    Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, whichproduces about 80 pct of that state's crop.    The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. "That's hurricaneforce. But they were isolated to just a small portion of theWest Texas area, probably less than five pct," Mohler said.    "No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in Julyor August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have beenworse," Mohler said.    About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has beenplanted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend ifweather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.    The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavierthan normal rainfall for several weeks, he said. Reuter
