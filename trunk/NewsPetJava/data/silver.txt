STUDY SHOWS ONLY LIMITED OPTIMISM FOR SILVER Silver looks "unlikely to break out ofgold and platinum's shadow" in the near future, although thisyear is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate thansupply, a study by Credit Suisse said.    The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13,200tonnes this year, against a 50 tonne increase in supply to14,050 tonnes. This should cut the global oversupply to 850tonnes from last year's provisional 1,100 tonnes.    The study noted that the effects of last year's lowerprices were having a dampening effect on total supply, whichwas now back down to around levels of a decade ago.    However, the study said that primary production, likely toreach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls.    Around a third of silver production comes from heavilyindebted Mexico and Peru.    Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that themajority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity.

HANDY AND HARMAN SEES SUFFICIENT SILVER SUPPLIES World stocks of silver are largeenough to accommodate any changes in the supply-demand equationthis year, with industrial consumption expected to again exceedmine production, the dealer house Handy and Harman said in itsannual review of the silver market.    The house estimated that the industry last year withdrew20,000,000 ounces of silver from stocks to bridge a supplydeficit caused by a consumption rate of 403,000,000 ounces andproduction level of 382,000,000 ounces.    However, world stocks are huge, totaling 2,267,900,000ounces at the end of 1986, it said.    The review noted that world industrial consumption has beenon an uptrend since 1980, although offtake is still 14 pctbelow the 1978 level of 442,000,000 ounces.    Handy and Harman said 22,800,000 ounces of silver were usedto produce coins last year, up from 12,700,000 ounces in 1985,with the demand getting a big boost from the production of U.S.coins, including the American Eagle.    It also said that in recent years Communist countries haveincreased their silver imports and estimated that China andEast Germany alone took in 70,000,000 ounces of foreign silverin the last five years.

SUNSHINE MINING CHIEF SEES SILVER AT 9.00 DLRS Heightened concern over renewedinflation is feeding the rally in silver and the upward movecould drive the inflation hedge metal this year to as much as9.00 dlrs per troy ounce, Mike Boswell chairman of SunshineMining Co told Reuters in an interview.    "The anticipated higher inflation is being manifested insilver rather than in gold which is the traditional choice ofinflation hedgers," said Boswell.    The strength could put silver in a range of "8.00 to 9.00dlrs even without any material swings in supply/demand,"Boswell said.    The buying interest for silver on the New York CommodityExchange (Comex) continued strong, with prices rising today toa September 1986 high of 6.465 dlrs per ounce. However goldlagged at 426.30 dlrs, the strongest price since late Januarythis year.    Boswell said silver has been "under-valued for so longrelative to gold but it's closing up the price gap."    He noted that silver last year held at the depressed levelof 5.00 dlrs while gold was soaring to more than 400.00 dlrs onconcern over the heated political unrest in South Africa. "Thestrength was not filtering down to silver last year. Nowwe're seeing a delayed reaction," the Sunshine Mining officialsaid.    Almost a year ago, U.S. producers shut down two of theirlargest silver properties, Sunshine and Hecla mining companies,both located in Idaho.    Boswell estimated that the closings slashed U.S. silverproduction by 10 mln ounces last year to less than 40 mlnounces.    "Low silver prices and high labor costs made ituneconomical to keep the mines opened," he said.    Increased imports from Mexico and Peru have made up for theloss of production in the United States which consumes 160 to170 mln ounces annually, Boswell said. Reuter
U.S. SILVER PRODUCTION ROSE IN DECEMBER U.S. mine production of silver roseto 2,295,230 troy ounces in December from 2,181,082 inNovember, the Interior Department's Bureau of Mines said.    U.S. imports of silver in December were 8,458,000 ounces,vs 19,950,000 in November, and 8,840,000 in December, 1985.    Silver exports totaled 1,549,000 ounces in December, vs2,346,000 in November and 1,504,000 ounces in December, 1985.    Silver mining production in the 12-month period Jan-Dec,1986 totaled 31,720,769 ounces, vs 39,357,197 ounces producedover the same period in 1985.   Imports of silver in Jan-Dec, 1986 totaled 144,890,000ounces, vs 152,601,000 ounces in Jan-Dec, 1985, while silverexports stood at 25,114,000 ounces and 24,756,000 ounces overthe respective periods, the bureau said.

MEXICO YET TO REPLY TO PERU'S SILVER INVITATION Mexico's minister of energy andmines, Alfredo del Mazo, has yet to reply to a Peruvianinvitation for ministerial-level talks on bilateral cooperationin silver marketing, a ministry spokesman said.    Peruvian officials said they extended the invitationearlier this week and that it was possible the talks could beheld within the next 15 days.    Meanwhile, a Banco de Mexico spokesman confirmed thatMexican central bank head Miguel Mancera Aguayo held privatetalks here yesterday with the president of the Peruvian centralbank.    The spokesman said the talks were in line with mutualconsultation agreements made during Peruvian President AlanGarcia's visit to Mexico in march.    Press reports citing diplomatic sources at the meeting saidthe two central bank heads discussed means of coordinatingactions in the silver market.    Mexico is the world's leading silver produer. It producedabout 73.9 mln troy ounces in 1986, according to preliminarygovernment figures.

PERU SAYS IT HELD TALKS WITH MEXICO ON SILVER The heads of the central banks of Mexicoand Peru have met in Mexico city to coordinate actions aimed atconsolidating the upward trend in the price of silver, theofficial newspaper El Peruano said.    It said that Peruvian central bank president LeonelFigueroa met yesterday with the president of the bank ofMexico, Miguel Mancera Aguayo.   Peru, which froze new sales of refined silver and itsgovernment-marketed silver ore on tuesday, is the world'ssecond biggest producer of the precious metal. Mexico is thelargest producer.    Together, the two nations account for nearly 40 pct of theworld's silver output, the official paper El Peruano said.    Peru adopted the move on tuesday in an bid to stablilisethe price of silver bullion, which has climbed in a month fromabout 5.70 dlrs an ounce to over 9.00 dlrs an ounce today.    After the meeting of the Peruvian and Mexican central bankheads, it was understood that Mexico might diversify the use ofsilver, El Peruano said.    It said that Mexico and Peru did not want to speculate withthe price of silver. Instead, they aimed to see that the priceof the precious metal recuperated to adequate levels.    El peruano did not specify what these levels were.    El peruano quoted energy and mines minister Wilfredo Huaytaas saying that Peru did not want to participate in speculativeoperations with silver.    He said the government's aim was to avoid a "brutal fall" inthe price of silver.    Figueroa's office confirmed the Peruvian central bankpresident had travelled to mexico city. It was not certain ifhe had returned to Lima by midday today. Reuter
PERU TO MAINTAIN SILVER SALES FREEZE Energy and mines minister, WilfredoHuayta, said Peru would maintain its freeze on new sales ofsilver until the price of the precious metal reaches "the truevalue this raw material should have."    He spoke to reporters at the presidential palace aftermeeting president Alan Garcia, whom he said recently spoke bytelephone with Mexican president Miguel de la Madrid. Mexicoand Peru are the world's two largest silver producers.    Huayta, asked what the true price level of silver shouldbe, repled: "well, this cannot be predicted."    He said Minero Peru Comercial (Minpeco), the government'sminerals marketing arm, would closely study the price of silverin the world market.    Last Tuesday, the government instructed Minpeco, whichhandles all Peru's exports of refined silver and state-produced ore, to immediately freeze all new silver sales untilthe metal's price reached equilibrium in the world market.   Peru plans to produce 63 mln ounces of silver this year, andis the largest producer of the precious metal after Mexico.   Huayta said both nations' central banks would coordinatetheir work, but did not elaborate how they would do this.   Peruvian central bank president Leonel Figueroa and the headof Bank of Mexico, Miguel Mancera Aguayo, met in Mexico Cityyesterday to coordinate actions aimed at consolidating theupward trend in the price of silver, the official newspaper ElPeruano said today.    Huayta said his Mexican counterpart, minister of oil, minesand parastatal industry, Alfredo del Mazo, should be in Lima ona visit at a nearby date.   Huayta added Peru did not want to see great fluctuations inthe price of silver, but declined to comment on what Peru wouldlike to see as a ceiling for the precious metal's price.   Silver bullion climbed to nearly 10.00 dlrs an ounce todayfrom about 5.70 dlrs an ounce a month ago. Reuter
PERU PRESIDENT WARNS OF RETALIATION ON SILVER The Peruvian government's freeze on silversales, which has contributed to a sharp boost in the metal'sprice, could draw retaliation by rich nations and big tradersseeking lower prices, President Alan Garcia said.    Peru, the world's second biggest silver producer, stoppedselling its refined silver and state-marketed ore on tuesday.Since then, the metal's price has risen to its highest level innearly three years. It closed today at over nine dlrs an ounceon world markets.    Garcia said the move showed that a small nation like Perucould move international markets and did not have to acceptcheap prices for silver, traditionally one of the top revenueearners of the country.    Peru exported its refined silver last year at an averageprice of 5.40 dlrs a troy ounce. As recently as one month ago,silver bullion was trading for about 5.70 dlrs an ounce onworld markets.    "One thing is that Peru, which produces silver, sells itsilently and in a submissive manner at the price world marketswant," he told reporters at the presidential palace.    "The other is that a nationalist government says, 'wait amoment I can't sell silver at these prices,'" he added.    The peruvian energy and mines minister, Wilfredo Huayta,said the government would maintain its freeze on new sales ofsilver until the price of the metal reaches "the true value thisraw material should have." He did not specify this level.    Garcia said rich nations and big traders, faced with Peru'sstance, could try to defend themselves.    "They have some stocks, they have silver deposits, they canmake fictitious sales and that way try to make the price of ourmineral fall in the world market," Garcia said.    "Whatever manoeuvre they take will be answered by Peru," hesaid. "Peru is in a position of action."    President Garcia had recently spoken by telephone withMexican President Miguel de la Madrid, Huayta said. Mexico isthe world's biggest producer of silver.    Mexico and Peru together produce nearly nearly 40 pct ofthe world's silver, the official newspaper El Peruano said.    The newspaper added that Peruvian central bank presidentLeonel Figueroa and the head of the central bank of Mexico,Miguel Mancera Aguayo, met in Mexico City yesterday tocoordinate actions aimed at consolidating the upward trend ofthe price of the metal.    Analysts in Zurich, a major silver trading centre, saidtoday the rally in silver prices was also fuelled by investorsbuying the metal to protect themselves against inflation, whichthey fear could be rekindled by the dollar's weakness.    On an historical basis, silver is still relatively cheapcompared to gold, which some investors believe could set thestage for further rises, they said. Reuter
MEXICO SILVER POLICIES UNCHANGED, OFFICIALS SAY Mexico's policies for silverproduction and sales have not changed despite Peru's decisionlast week to freeze its silver sales, government mining andcentral bank officials said.    The officials also expressed doubt that such a policychange was in the works.    Mexico is the world's leading silver producer and had anoutput of about 73.9 mln troy ounces last year, according topreliminary government figures.    Peru, the world's second leading silver producer, last weeksuspended sales of the precious metal in what authorities inLima said was an effort to protect its price in an unstablemarket.    Since the decision, Peruvian officials have said they willdiscuss cooperation in the silver market with Mexican officialsin scheduled meetings.    Last week, Peruvian central bank president Leonel Figueroaand the head of the central bank of Mexico, Miguel ManceraAguayo met in Mexico City in private talks said aimed atconsolidating the upward trend of silver prices.    Mexican minister of energy and mines, Alfredo del Mazo, isalso expected to meet soon with his Peruvian counterpart,Wilfredo Huayta.    However, no Mexican decision has been made to follow thePeruvian example of suspending new silver sales, Mexicanofficials said.    One Mexican mining sector official working closely with thegovernment's production and sales policy told Reuters therehave been no changes in policy handed down by the central bank.    "The same policy that has been followed will be continued,"said the official, who asked not to be further identified.    A spokesman for the central bank said the bank had noinformation on any silver policy changes.    An energy and mines ministry spokesman and an official inthe ministry's metallurgy department also said no governmentsilver policy change had been made.    The mining sector official also said he doubted Mexicowould follow Peru's policy, reasoning that if the twogovernments had intended to coordinate silver policies, Mexicowould have announced a sales suspension along with Peru lastweek.    "It's very probable a change won't be made," the officialsaid. Reuter
