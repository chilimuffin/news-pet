LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987 Liquefied natural gas imports fromAlgeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though itseconomically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.    Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerianstate petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview inAlgiers that such imports would be made this year.    "Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government andthe time required to restart mothballed terminals will delaythe import until 1988/1989," Daniel Tulis, a natural gasanalyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.    Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its formercustomers, Panhandle Eastern <PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiaryof Cabot Corp <CBT> to resume LNG export, company officialstold Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of BurlingtonNorthern <BNI>, has expressed no interest.    Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG werefeasible. "On a marginal cost basis, the companies that havemade capital investment to handle LNG import can operateprofitably even in the current price environment,"  FrankSpadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.   Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian importson U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trendhigher by the end of 1987.    A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf ofMexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firmprices, Shearson's Tulis said.   In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source ofsupplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.    Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.    Company sources also said that any negotiations withAlgeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relatevolumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot marketvalues. Reuter

FERC ISSUES TAKE-OR-PAY GAS POLICY PLAN The Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission (FERC) issued a proposed policy statement for the recovery of take-or-pay costs imposed by existing natural gascontracts between producers and pipelines.    It put out the statement, by 5-0 vote, for a 30-day commentperiod. It also put out an alternative policy statement byCommissioner Charles Stalon.    FERC said in a press release that "the proposed policystatement estblishes an exception to the commission's generalpolicy that take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs must berecovered through pipeline' commodity sales rates."    FERC added that "specifically, in cases where pipelinesassume an equitable share of buy-out or buy-down costs, thecommission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover theremaining costs through their demand rates."

COASTAL <CGP> SEEKS TO HALT BILLION DLR LAWSUIT Coastal Corp said a federal bankruptcycourt will hear its request today for a restraining order tostop a two billion dlr lawsuit against it by <TransAmericanNatural Gas Corp>.    TransAmerican, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcyproceedings in 1983 to reorganise its debts, filed the lawsuitto block Coastal from taking control.    Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey confirmed the company, whichis an unsecured creditor of TransAmerican, would present itsown reorganisation plan to the bankruptcy court.    Under the plan, Coastal would buy the natural gas reservesand pipeline system owned by TransAmerican in Texas for anundisclosed amount.    TransAmerican lawyer John Nabors said the company valuesits total assets, including an unused oil refinery, at aboutone billion dlrs.    The company, the second-largest natural gas producer inTexas, said it has gas reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet andover 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.    About 80 pct of TransAmerican's gas is available for spotmarket sales in Texas during peak demand, it said.    Nabors said the TransAmerican reorganisation would repayits 770 mln dlr debt with profits from natural gas sales. Thelawsuit seeks one billion dlrs in actual damages and onebillion in punitive damages from Coastal.    Coastal has been trying to break into the Texas gas marketsince 1979, when it was forced to sell <Lo-Vaca Gas GatheringCo> to settle over 1.6 billion dlrs in lawsuits by Texascustomers facing abrupt curtailment of supply.    Coastal, a natural gas producer and pipeline company,earned 71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion in 1986, abouthalf the its 1985 profits, due to slumping energy prices. REUTER

Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiarysaid, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice aproposal to include these costs in the company's most recentpurchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing.    Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denialruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternativefiling if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing toinclude the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA orconsolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filingand permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one.    The company said the alternative filing seeks to recoverabout 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas salescommodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based onrecovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,beginning April 1, 1987.    Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipelinecommodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln.    The company said it orginially sought to include thesecosts in its PGA since the payments to products resulted inalmost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and werenot related to take-or-pay buyout costs.    It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-paybuyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filingunder the Natural Gas Act.    As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average pricepaid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrsper mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April1985.

NORTH AMERICAN GAS MARKET SOUGHT BY FERC Blocking Canadian gas importswould not serve the long-term interests of the United States,said Martha Hesse, chairman of the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission, adding that the development of a freely open NorthAmerican energy market should be encouraged.    "I firmly believe that the long-term interest of U.S.consumers would not be served by any attempt to promote a 'Madein America' label for gas," she said at an oil and gasconference.    She said the commission recognizes the important roleCanadian gas plays in the American market, despite grumblingsamong U.S. domestic producers of the competition from north ofthe border.    Recent figures show Canada shipped 2.48 billion Canadiandlrs worth of gas to the U.S. in 1986, down sharply from the3.91 billion dlr total in 1985.    "But we do seriously recognize the importance in the yearsto come of the supplies of Canadian gas to U.S. markets," shesaid. "And even in the short term, competition is generally agood thing," she added.    She said the commission is concentrating on improving theaccess to U.S. pipelines, something that would be of greatbenefit to Canadian producers.    Hesse said transportation of Canadian gas is alreadyimproving, gas imports rising more than 21 pct in the first twomonths of the year. But Hesse declined to comment in detail onthe controversial December order, known as the "as billed issue",because it is the subject of a new hearing.    The order, which is being fought by Canada, involvesbarring U.S. pipeline companies and consumers from payingcertain Canadian shipping expenses.    Hesse said the order was never intended "as an attempt toextend the arm of U.S. regulations across the border."    However, a senior Canadian government energy officialwarned delegates the ruling could severely weaken Canadian gasproducers. "Besides the extra territorial effect, there is thepotential that Canadian consumers and producers may end upsubsidizing the cost of transportation services originallyincurred on behalf of U.S. customers," said Robert Skinner, anassistant deputy minister in Canada's energy department.

NORTH AMERICAN GAS MARKET RECOVERY YEARS AWAY Better times for the hard hitnatural gas industry remains two to three years away as aseemingly intractable supply bubble continues to depress salesand prices, industry officials said.    An uncertain regulatory environment, disputes over Canadianpricing policies and unusually warm winters are working againsta quick recovery in the sector, a number of corporate andgovernment speakers told an energy conference here.    "We see a tough, tough short-term market, both as to priceand volume," said Michael Phelps, vice president of <WestcoastTransmission Co Ltd>, a major Canadian natural gas carrier.    But Phelps predicted a fall in U.S. supply -- caused by asharp drop in exploration -- and a slight demand increaseshould help to burn off the excess supply by 1990.    As a result, Canadian gas exports to the U.S. market shouldrise to up to 1.5 trillion cubic feet a year by the end of thedecade, nearly double 1986's total.    The health of the Canadian industry is heavily dependent onthe U.S. market where nearly one third of Canada's gasproduction is sent.    Cuba Wadlington, a vice president at Northwest PipelineCorp of Salt Lake City, shared the view that markets could bein balance by 1990.    He said while North American demand for natural gas hasflattened at about 18 trillion cubic feet a year, a return tomore colder winters in the next few years could quickly tightensupplies.    "Things are clearly working towards a shrinking of thebubble," Wadlington told Reuters in an interview.    However, recent decisions by the U.S. Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission (FERC) were sharply criticized byCanadian delegates who suggested the moves could prevent thecountry from participating in the market's recovery.    The key dispute, known as the as billed issue, involves aruling last December by FERC which effectively bars U.S.pipeline companies and consumers from paying certain Canadianshipping expenses.    The Canadian government believes the ruling could severelyweaken the country's gas producers. "Besides theextra-territorial effect, there is the potential that Conadianproducers and consumers may end up subsidizing the cost oftransportation services originally incurred on behalf of U.S.customers," said Robert Skinner, an assistant deputy minister inCanada's energy department.    But FERC Chairman Martha Hesse told the conference theruling was really intended "to assure equal, fair and opencompetition in the pricing of natural gas sold within ourcountry -- whatever the source of the gas."    Hesse maintained Canadian gas was crucial to the emergenceof a freely competitive, continent-wide, energy market.    Speaking to concerns in Canada that the U.S. is seeking tolimit Canadian gas shipments, Hesse said such a move would workagainst the long-term interest of American consumers. "We trulyconstitute a North American market," she said. "Natural gasmoving through pipelines recognizes no boundries." Reuter
GAS GROWTH SEEN HURT BY REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY Demand for natural gas has failed togrow in proportion to the decline in oil deliveries because ofconcerns over unresolved regulatory issues in the UnitedStates, said industry analysts and gas utility company sources.    "Natural gas is not free to compete," said Larry Makovich,director of utilities service at Data Resources Inc, "problemson pipeline open access and take-or-pay liabilities still weighheavily on end-users' decision to switch to natural gas."    A manager with an East Coast gas distribution company,agreed that reluctance among end-users often stemmed from fearof unresolved regulatory issues.    "The fact that at the federal level open access is not yetfirmly in place threatens to impede free flow of natural gasfrom producers to consumers," he said.     Michael German, an economist with the American GasAssociation, said while a significant amount of gas was nowreplacing oil in dual-fuel boilers, the progress of expandingthe marketshare of gas was slow. First quarter natural gasconsumption data is not available until June.    In the first three months of 1987, residual fuel demandfell by an average of 55,000 barrels per day, according to theAmerican Petroleum Institute. Natural gas, however, was notable to take full advantage of the decline in oil consumption.    AGA's German said that while industrial consumers wereconcerned with regulatory issues in their long-range capitalinvestment decisions, in the dual-fuel boiler market relied onspot purchases.    "With all the capability of switching (from oil to naturalgas) already there, price of the fuel is the only concern," hesaid, adding that compared with the same period last year,January natural gas price at burner tip is 16 pct lower forindustrial users and 32 pct lower for utilities.    German attributed the sluggish performance of natural gasto lower demand in the utility sector as a whole.    "March was warmer than normal, which cut down gasconsumption not only in home heating but also in electricitygeneration," he said.     In March, according to API monthly statistics, residualfuel deliveries fell by 13.6 pct to 1.2 mln barrels per dayfrom the same period a year ago.    While API specifically mentioned lower natural gas priceshad put residual fuel at a price disadvantage among electricutilities and industrial users, industry analysts believed therole of natural gas was over-stated.    Makovich of DRI noted much of the decline in oil in thefuel mix was taken up by new nuclear capacity coming on streamin the last few years.    Nuclear capacity rose nine pct in 1986, and he projectedthe same rate of growth for 1987 and 11 pct growth in 1988.     In contrast, oil and gas together represented only 15 pctof the fuel mix in 1986 and should decline to 13 pct by 1989,he said. Within this sector, gas share fell to 66 pct in 1986from 76 pct a year ago due to competition from falling oilprices, he added. But this year, gas was expected to recaptureonly two pct of the share, Makovich said.    Michael German of AGA agreed and said, "Nevertheless,outlet for several hundred billion cubic feet of gas a year issignificant in a glutted market." Reuter
COASTAL <CGP>, TRANSAMERICAN SETTLE GAS DISPUTE Coastal Corp and TransAmerican NaturalGas Corp have proposed settling more than four billion dlrs inlawsuits with an agreement for natural gas sales andtransportation between the two Texas firms, a lawyer forCoastal said.    The proposed settlement also provided for Coastal towithdraw its reorganization plan in TransAmerican's bankruptcyproceedings.    Thomas McDade, a lawyer for Coastal, said the settlementincluded a five-year agreement for TransAmerican to transportup to 100 mln cubic feet of natural gas daily from south Texasfields to major pipeline interchanges. TransAmerican will alsosell Coastal up to 125 mln cubic feet of gas at spot marketprices during the next 10 years.    McDade said Coastal would agree to support TransAmerican'splan of reorganization pending in federal bankruptcy court.    TransAmerican, a Houston-based natural gas production andpipeline company, had sued Coastal for 4.1 billion dlrsalleging that Coastal chairman Oscar Wyatt wrongly interferedwith TransAmerican's reorganization efforts. Coastal is one ofTransAmerican's unsecured creditors. Reuter

PAN-ALBERTA/UNITED GAS SETTLEMENT APPROVED Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd said its1986 proposed settlement with United Gas Pipe Line Co, ofHouston, received unconditional approval by the U.S. FederalEnergy Regulator Commission.    Pan-Alberta said the approved deal authorized terms of atwo-year interim contract amendment, cash payments andtransportation credits for Pan-Alberta's customers, minimumyearly natural gas takes by United and a two-year commodityprice. United will pay Pan-Alberta producers about 50 mln dlrsover the interim period and take at least an average 40 mlncubic feet a day of gas, Pan-Alberta said. Reuter
BROOKLYN UNION<BU> SEEN HURT BY PIPELINE CLOSURE Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gasutility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result ofTransco Energy Co's <E> decision to close its pipelines totransport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.    Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in theUnited States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, ornon-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spotsupplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,analysts said.    Texas Eastern pipelines <TET>, the other competingpipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the Southclosed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union hasrelied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.     In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrsper mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gascosts four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.    Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide openaccess to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fearof accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.    Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers forgas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.    Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount ofsupplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, aBrooklyn Union official said.    Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidmost of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed throughto rate payers.    While net effect on the company will not be known forseveral months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,will end up paying more for gas, he said.    Because the closure takes place in summer months when gasdemand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would besmall, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson LufkinJenrette, said.    If the situation persists into winter heating season, highcost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.    Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco forspot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co <NCNG>,Piedmont Natural Gas Co <PNY>, will face the same high costfactor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager withend users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokeringfirm, said.    "But these companies are not unwitting victims of thetake-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers," he said.    Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's requestfor an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facilityfor spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.    Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas willthreaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting toalternative fuels, he said.    In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is beingnegotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.    Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gasfor them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatoryon the inventory charge, he said.    "Cool heads will prevail," DLJ's Launer said, " but it maytake a while."        Reuter
ALLEGHENY <ALGH.O> FORMING SUBSIDIARY Allegheny and Western Energy Corp saidit was forming a subsidiary to market gas to smaller users inWest Virginia.

TENNECO <TGT> TO TRANSPORT GAS ON OPEN ACCESS Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas PipelineCo, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transportnatural gas under the open access rules of the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission, FERC.    In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transportcompany, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines alsotransport its own gas to customers.    Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co <T> rejected the FERCguidelines, saying it would not offer open access until theregulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces forgas it has bought but could not sell.    The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or paycontracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-termcontracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe ascustomers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.    Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week thatTenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines toopen-access because of the take-or-pay issue.    But Tenneco today said open access "is one of the stepsFERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERCis moving the industry through this restructuring now, evenbefore all transitional problems are solved."    A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposureunder the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figurefor Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines fromLouisiana and Texas up to New England.    "We remain convinced that the most critical transitionalissue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved byFERC in the near future.    "A failure to do so could have grave consequences for theindustry's continued ability to provide its customers withreliable natural gas," said Tennessee Gas Transmission Copresident R.C. Thomas.

BROOKLYN UNION <BU> TO BUY GAS FROM SHELL OIL Brooklyn Union Gas Co said it hascontracted to purchase up to 60 mln cubic feet of natural gasper day from Shell Oil Co, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <SC>subsidiary.    Brooklyn Union said the long-term contract will cover about15 pct of its total supplies.    A spokesman said Shell and the utility agreed to notdisclose the length of the contract or the price of the gas,which he described as competitive with a market sensitiveescalation formula.       Brooklyn Union said the gas from Shell Oil will replaceabout 25 pct of the gas previously supplied by Transco EnergyInc's <E> Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp subsidiary.    The utility said Transcontinental will transport the gasbeing purchased from Shell Oil, possibly beginning as soon asNovember 1. Reuter
