HOUSTON METALS' MINE YIELDS POSITIVE RESULTS <Houston Metals Corp> said thethe first phase of the underground rehabilitation, extensivedrilling and bulk sampling program at its Silver Queen Mine hasyielded positive results.    Houston said representative assays from the 2,750 ft and2,600 ft levels at the south end of the mine established oredeposits in the following ranges: copper, 3.7 pct to 5.08 pct,lead .99 pct to 1.5 pct, zinc six pct to 9.6 pct, silver 15.63pct to 79.92 oz per ton, gold .062 to .19 oz per ton, germanium93 to 103 grams per ton, gallium five to 18 grams per ton.    In addition, Houston Metals said the weighted average of 25diamond-drilled holes 375 ft below the 2,600 foot level and 800ft along the strike assayed gold at .237 oz per ton, silver at10.91 oz per ton and zinc at 8.99 pct.    An apparent parallel vein structure at the 2,600 ft levelreturned similar values, the company said.    It added that preliminary metallurgical tests fromrepresentative bulk ore samples indicate the commercialfeasability of producing a zinc and a copper-lead concentrate.    Houston Metals said gold, silver and the base metals haverecoveries of 90 pct to 95 pct, with 95 pct of gold recoveredfrom better gold ores, while gallium, germanium and indium haverecoveries of between 66 pct to 82 pct and are included in thezinc concentrate.

ZINC PRODUCERS APPROACH EC ON VOLUNTARY CLOSURES A number of individual zinc producingcompanies have approached the European Commission to sound outits reaction to a possible industry plan for a voluntaryreduction of smelting capacity, Commission sources said.    The companies have been told that the Commission could notjudge whether a plan would be acceptable under EuropeanCommunity, EC, competition rules until it had full details,they said.    In 1983, the industry drew up a plan envisaging the loss ofabout 130,000 tonnes of annual capacity, or about 10 pct of thetotal.    However, the industry did not proceed with this plan aszinc market conditions improved in 1984, the sources noted.

SEOUL UNVEILS SHOPPING LIST OF U.S. GOODS South Korea unveiled a shopping list of2.6 billion dlrs of U.S. Goods in line with its new policy ofseeking to limiting its trade surplus to ease trade frictionwith Washington.    The government said this would help freeze this year'strade surplus with the United States at the 1986 level.    "The surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dollars last yearfrom 4.3 billion in 1985, was projected to top 10 billion thisyear but the government has taken steps to constrain it to theseven billion dollar level," one Trade Ministry official toldReuters.    A government statement said the 2.6 billion dlrs was inaddition to about two billion dlrs of purchases made last monthby a South Korean trade mission to the United States.    The announcement follows a visit here this week by U.S.Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who said that if SouthKorea wanted to avoid protectionist retaliation it should notfalter in its policies to open its market and cut its surplus.    The statement said the government, state agencies and otherpublic institutions would buy 480 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Cars,computers, helicopters, ambulances, motorcycles, medical andlaboratory equipment and other products. "This amounts includes89 mln dlrs worth of purchases which were not originallyreflected in their budgets," it added.    The list includes 1.13 billion dlrs of capital goods, 700mln of farm products, 50 mln of aluminium, zinc, polyethyleneand other raw materials, and 250 mln of steel, electronics andshipbuilding parts which would be shifted from other nations.    Agriculture Ministry officials said South Korea had alreadybought 310 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Wheat, raw cotton, corn andsoybeans.    This meant the country would buy from the United Statesnearly all of the 1.27 billion dlrs of its planned imports ofsuch commodities this year, they said.    The government will also take steps to reduce tariffs,accelerate the opening of its markets, voluntarily restrainexports and cut export financing, the statement said.

COMINCO SEEKS MEETING WITH STRIKING UNION LOCALS Cominco Ltd said itexpects to meet today with two of five United Steelworkers ofAmerica locals on strike at its Trail smelter and Kimberley,B.C. lead-zinc mine, a Cominco spokesman said.    It had no meeting scheduled with the other three strikinglocals, which rejected a tentative three-year contractSaturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.    Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost ofliving increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, butno wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.    The three locals represent about 2,600 production andmaintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about600 office and technical workers.    The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since thestrike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare forcemajeure, which means the company may be unable to honorcontracts for products from the smelter and mine.    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all ofwhich expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons oflead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 mileseast of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,most for processing at the Trail smelter.

COMINCO <CLT> SETS TENTATIVE TALKS ON STRIKE Cominco Ltd said it settentative talks with three striking union locals that rejectedon Saturday a three-year contract offer at Cominco's Trail andKimberley, British Columbia lead-zinc operations.    The locals, part of United Steelworkers of America,represent 2,600 production and maintenance workers. No date hasbeen set for the talks, the spokesman replied to a query.    The spokesman said talks were still ongoing with the twoother striking locals, representing 600 office and technicalworkers. Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut downsince the strike started May 9.    Each of the five locals has a separate contract thatexpired April 30, but the main issues are similar.

CONCENTRATION OF ZINC INDUSTRY SEEN CONTINUING The world's zinc mining and smeltingindustry will continue to become more concentrated and moreintegrated in the 1990s, Dr Klaus Goekmann, vice-president ofmarketing and sales for Cominco Ltd, said.    Opening a Metal Bulletin base metals conference here,Goekmann forecast the number of individual businesses in theindustry would continue to decline as companies merged orformed conglomerates with increased market shares.    At the same time, the conglomerates would become moreintegrated, handling the entire chain from basic ore productionthrough marketing, he added.    "The key to future viability will be flexibility. Prices arelikely to remain at current historically low levels at least inthe medium term, and competition with other metals andmaterials will continue to intensify," Goekmann said.    "In the past, we have only reacted to changes in the world'smarket and economics. In the future, we have to act lessdefensively and more aggressively."    The industry also has massive overcapacity and this problemhas to be tackled quickly, he added.    "Attempts in the past to cut out this excess capacity inEurope have all failed miserably. However, there is some hopethat current efforts may be successful," Goekmann said.    At the same time, companies must move to limit theirgeographical and currency risks and become far more marketingorientated, he added.    "With all these changes and rationalization, the industrycan survive to recover its past strength and profitability.Without them, the future does not look very rosy," Goekmannsaid. Reuter
NORANDA <NOR.TO> IN TALKS WITH BRUNSWICK MINERS Noranda Inc said contract talks thatresumed today were continuing with about 1,600 unionizedworkers at its 63 pct-owned Brunswick Mining and Smelter Corp<BMS.TO> lead-zinc mine and lead smelter at Bathurst, NewBrunswick.    A Noranda official said in reply to an inquiry that thetalks involved both the mine and smelter union locals, whichare part of the United Steelworkers of America.    The mineworkers' contract expires July 1. They will vote onJune 22 either to authorize a strike or ratify a possiblecontract offer. The smelter workers' pact expires July 21.    The Brunswick mine produced 413,800 tonnes of zinc and206,000 tonnes of lead last year at a recovery rate of 70.5 pctzinc and 55.6 pct lead. Concentrates produced were 238,000tonnes of zinc and 81,000 tonnes of lead. Reuter

ZINC CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTFALL SEEN IN 1988 Next year is likely to see a shortfallin zinc concentrates of up to 100,000 tonnes, although thereshould be ample supply in 1987, Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltdmetals analyst Stephen Briggs said.    Speaking on the second day of Metal Bulletin's base metalsconference, Briggs said the major factor in his predicted100,000 tonne shortfall in zinc concentrate supply in 1988 wasthe imminent cessation of new mining and termination of millingat Pine Point in Canada.    However, this could be partially offset by some stockpiles.    Nevertheless, despite this predicted shortfall there wasunlikely to be any dramatic change in treatment charges in1988. The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one ofrecord production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipatedin Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacityin South Korea.    "Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are alsoexpected in 1987," Briggs said.    This would partly be due to a return to more normal levelsat existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied withachievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faroin Canada.    Looking further forward, the major event was the probableopening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacityof 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year.    "Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that therewill be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s," headded.    The picture for lead was also closely allied to that ofzinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and thereforesupply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products fromzinc mines.    "On this basis, our calculations point to a modestoversupply of lead concentrates in 1987," Briggs said.    The copper forecast, however, was for a recordnon-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987,increasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988.    Production of primary refined copper metal would alsoincrease, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading toa moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnesthis year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of thedecade, he said.

MAJOR EUROPEAN ZINC SMELTER MERGER SEEN BY 1990 There should be at least one mergerbetween major European zinc smelters before the end of thedecade, Christian Bue, Executive Vice President (commercial) ofSMM Penarroya in France, said.    Speaking on the second day of the Metal Bulletin basemetals conference, Bue said he expected the current talksbetween five smelters including Penarroya to result inintegration between at least some of the companies before 1990.    The five companies, SMM Penarroya, Outokumpu Oy, PreussagAg, Ste de la Vieille Montagne and Boliden Ore and Metals AB,have 22 pct of the world market, Bue added.    "We have no alternative than to integrate out businessesinto large trading blocs if we are to survive the cut-throatprice competition and the trend to forward integration from themining companies," Bue said.    "It is by no means certain that all the five companiesinvolved in the talks will integrate together. It is quitelikely, and even preferable, that the European smelters formtwo or three large integrated blocs.    "In this way we will be better able to negotiate with ourconcentrate suppliers on one side, and with the metal buyers onthe other," Bue added.    In the past, production overcapacity and the intensecompetition between the European zinc smelters has meant theyhave not only been in a very weak negotiating position whenbuying concentrates, but in an even weaker one when selling themetal, Bue noted.    Although the apparently easy solution is to simply shutdown excess capacity, the burden of this on individualcompanies is far too heavy and no one can be expected tovolunteer, he added.    Another possible but very risky solution is to investheavily in more modern and lower cost facilities, he said.    "My answer to this suggestion is that individual companieswho do not invest will surely die, and those that do investmight survive, but only might, " Bue said.    "The only real option in my mind is integration,rationalization and stabilization. We have no alternative, " headded.    Bue also said that the European smelters were completelydissatisfied with the tradition of pricing concentrates andmetals in US dollars, and suggested moving either to a basketof the world's major currencies or pricing in European currencyunits (Ecus) to protect against exchange rate volatility.    Bue's views on integration between European smelters weremet by general approval from the conference audience comprisingrepresentatives from many of the world's major mining, smeltingand trading companies, although some of the miningrepresentatives were somewhat sceptical in view of their ownindustry's move towards integration with smelters.    However, some concentrate traders did express worry abouttheir own position if the metals industry does make the move tolarge trading blocs.    The currency basket suggestion cropped up constantly, butfew said they thought matters would change in the near future. REUTER

FORCE MAJEURE LIFTED AT CAJAMARQUILLA Peru's state minerals marketing arm, MineroPeru Comercial SA (Minpeco), lifted a force majeure on zincingot shipments from the country's biggest zinc refinery atCajamarquilla, a spokesman said.    The spokesman said the problems affecting sulphuric acidand roaster plants that had halted production since May 4 hadbeen resolved.    However, he said production of zinc ingots this year wasexpected to fall to around 86,000 tonnes this year atCajamarquilla, from 94,000 tonnes in 1986 because of thestoppage.    The refinery has an optimum annual production capacity of100,000 tonnes but its highest production was 96,000 tonnes ofrefined zinc ingots in 1985, the spokesman said. Reuter
