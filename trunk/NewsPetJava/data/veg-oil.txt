OILS/FATS STOCKS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY IN 1986/87 Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats areprobably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.    Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cutto only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with10.6 mln a year earlier.    Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun,rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin andcastor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil,lard and tallow/greases.    Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight productionincrease of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987,compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in theprevious two seasons.    It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusuallylow prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demandfor both food and non-food purposes, it said.    World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mlntonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higherif the Indian government did not artificially curb domesticdemand.    Oil World said it did not expect the European Community(EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax wereintroduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption. Reuter
U.S. REAFFIRMS OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX PLAN A meeting among government agenciestoday reaffirmed the strong opposition of the United States toa proposed new tax on vegetable oils and fats in the EuropeanCommunity, U.S. trade officials said.    Representatives of the major government agencies agreed ata trade policy review group meeting, which includes officialsof the deputy secretary rank, to continue diplomatic pressureon EC member states.    "We (all agencies) are together on this," said one U.S.trade official.    One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear tomember states and to the EC commission that if Brusselsproceeds with the vegetable oils tax "there will be a greatcost."    U.S. officials said no formal list of European products onwhich the U.S. might retaliate, has yet been drawn up.    "I don't think we're at that point yet," said one tradeofficial, adding that the EC has only begun deliberations onits farm price package.    Suzanne Early, assistant trade representative, told Reutersthe interagency meeting was to discuss U.S. strategy on thevegetable oils issue. Asked about retaliation, she said"sometimes its better not to be specific."    U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Monday warnedanother major transatlantic trade row will develop if the ECproceeds with the vegetable oils tax. Reuter
BRITISH MINISTER CRITICISES PROPOSED EC OILS TAX A British minister said that a proposedEuropean Community tax on vegetable oils and fats would raisethe price of fish and chips and he pledged the government wouldfight against it.    Lord Belstead, a junior agriculture minister, told theHouse of Lords the tax would raise the price of raw materialsused in many processed foods by about 100 pct.

CCC REALLOCATES CREDIT GUARANTEES TO EL SALVADOR The Commodity Credit Corporation,CCC, has reallocated two mln dlrs in credit guranteespreviously earmarked for sales of U.S. protein meals to coversales of vegetable oil and tallow to El Salvador, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    The action reduces coverage for sales of protein meals to14 mln dlrs from 16 mln dlrs and creates new lines of one mlndlrs for tallow and/or greases and one mln dlrs for vegetableoils, the department said.    All sales under the credit guarantee lines must beregistered and exported by Sepember 30, 1987, it said.    The guarantee rates include a charge to provide for ayearly interest rate coverage of up to 4.5 pct on theguaranteed value, the department said. Reuter

YEUTTER REPEATS RETALIATION THREAT ON EC OIL TAX U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said the United States will retaliate if the EuropeanCommunity adopts a proposed tax on vegetable oils, but he didnot say what EC products would be singled-out for reprisal.    Speaking to the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA)convention here, Yeutter said he is "cautiously optimistic" thecontroversial oils tax proposal will be rejected by the ECCouncil of Ministers.    Yeutter said the proposed tax is a "flagrant violation ofthe spirit of GATT" because it would imperil the zero bindingduty on U.S. exports of soybeans to Europe.    He said the Reagan administration has yet to decide on aretaliation list. The administration would not reveal aretaliation list unless the EC approved the proposal, he said. Reuter

EC OILS TAX NO LONGER MAJOR ISSUE - ASSOCIATION The proposed European Community (EC) taxon vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on theagenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat, theWest German Feed Stuffs Industry Association (MFI) said.    Association chairman Ulrich Wagner told a news conferencethe West German feed industry believes the EC does notseriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because itwould end in another transatlantic trade war.    "We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And theCommission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies."    American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect WayneBennett said yesterday in The Hague that U.S. Soybean producerswere confident the tax would be rejected.

BELGIAN MINISTER TO REVIEW EC OILS/FATS TAX PLAN Belgian Agriculture Minister Paul deKeersmaeker said he would review EC Commission proposals for atax on imported and EC produced vegetable oils and fats in thelight of objections made by certain EC member states.    De Keersmaeker, current chairman of the EC farm ministers'council, was speaking after a three-day meeting of ministers atwhich the tax proposal was one of the key themes.    He said he would review the position as part of plans topresent compromise proposals for the 1987/88 farm price packageto the next meeting, starting in Brussels on May 18.    De Keersmaeker, who said there was "a great deal ofresistance in many delegations" to the tax, declined to say whataspects of the proposals he would review.    However, EC Commission sources said they are expected toinclude the question of whether it should apply to marine oils.    They said Denmark and Portugal might agree to the tax, tobe set initially at 330 Ecus a tonne, if these oils, of whichthey are major producers, were excluded.    The sources said, however, that Britain, the Netherlandsand West Germany continue to have strong objections to the tax,partly because of fears that its impact on U.S. Soybean exportscould provoke transatlantic trade friction.    They said that, if these three countries held firm to thisposition, they would be able to block the proposal under theEC's majority voting mechanism. Reuter

EC farm ministers have been unable to agree the tax, one ofthe main items proposed by Andriessen for the 1987-88 farmprice package.

ACP STATES SAY EC OILS TAX PLAN BREAKS ACCORDS Developing countries said the EuropeanCommunity (EC) would breach two international agreements if itwent ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.    Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific(ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit theexports of 26 ACP countries.    They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedureslaid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relationsbetween ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affecttrade between the two sides.    They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertakingnot to bring in new protectionist measures during the currentPunta del Este round of world trade negotiations being heldunder GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.    The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 Europeancurrency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-producedvegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which couldraise up to two billion Ecus a year.    EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax,are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at amarathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg onJune 15.    Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries areconvinced this would lead to EC industry substituting productsmade within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimatesthis would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in itsmember country exports.    "We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures toundermine our countries, but such would be the impact of thesemeasures," Wilson said.    The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hitby the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if itis approved.    Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only "as a verylast resort," but added that the ACP is in touch with othercountries which oppose the plan.    Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clearJamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does notexport oils and fats.    Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast,Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says. Reuter
EC FARM CRISIS LIKELY TO GO TO END-JUNE SUMMIT Plans for key reforms of the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) controversial farm policy will almostcertainly have to be referred to the bloc's heads of governmentat a summit meeting on June 29 and 30, Belgian finance ministerMark Eyskens said today.    Eyskens was speaking at a news conference after chairing ajoint meeting of EC finance and agriculture ministers which wasdesigned to help break a deadlock over this year's EC farmprice package which has endured since March.    Diplomats quoted EC Executive Commission president JacquesDelors as saying at the same meeting that it would be adisaster if the two most difficult issues at the farm talks hadto be referred to heads of government.    These issues are a Commission plan for a tax on marine andvegetable fats and oils, and proposals to change the system bywhich EC farm prices, expressed in European currency units(Ecus), are translated into the currencies of member states.    The oils and fats tax is opposed by a group of countrieswhich fears it could provoke trade retaliation by the U.S., Amajor exporter of soybeans to the EC.    West Germany, meanwhile, is strongly against the technicalcurrency move, which would result in additional price cuts forfarmers in countries with strong currencies, such as the mark.    Commission sources said Delors is anxious that the twoissues are not referred to the summit because this would meanheads of government diverting their attention from much moreimportant world and Community issues.    Eyskens said decisions from heads of government were alsolikely to be less sound since they do not usually interestthemselves in such technically complex questions.    However, Eyskens said today's meeting had thrown up somenuances in member state positions "which may make the dialoguemore constructive in the next few weeks."    If farm prices are not decided by the end of this month,the Commission could use its own powers to impose a seven pctcut in cereals prices, farm trade sources said. It originallyproposed measures to cut farm spending by 1.1 billion Ecus thisyear, with effective price cuts of over 10 pct for some crops.    Diplomats said farm ministers might be able to agree aprice package cutting spending by around 340 mln Ecus but fortheir disagreements on the oils/fats tax and on currencyreforms.    The finance ministers were called in to emphasise the needfor budgetary restraint in the face of an almost certain ECbudget deficit of over five billion Ecus this year.    Although Delors was said by aides to have found today'smeeting very useful, diplomats said there was little sign of amajor shift in the position of member states, or of financeministers adopting a different line from that of theiragriculture colleagues.    The farm ministers are expected to meet for most of thisweek in Luxembourg in a pre-summit attempt to bridge theirdifferences. REUTER
SPAIN COMES OUT AGAINST EC FATS TAX Spain has joined the group ofEuropean Community countries opposed to the proposed tax onmarine and vegetable oils and fats, diplomatic sources said.    They said the Spanish position was clarified at a jointmeeting here of EC finance and agriculture ministers to discussthe budgetary situation surrounding this year's EC farm pricenegotiations.    Previously, West Germany, Britain, Portugal and Denmarkhave declared themselves against the tax with Spain's positionunclear, the sources said.    The sources said Spanish junior finance minister Guillermode la Dehesa said Spain was against the tax because of itsimplications for world trade talks within the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade and because it was discrimatory byexcluding butter.    They said the countries now opposed to the tax have farmore votes than needed under the EC's majority voting system toblock the proposal. Reuter
GERMANY PLANS TO RUSH SPECIAL CREDITS TO FARMERS Bonn is expected to rush throughlegislation this month creating special credits to protect WestGerman farmers from a proposed European Community, EC, paymentsfreeze, government sources said.    The new measures are apparently designed to shield WestGerman farmers from the consequences of the looming EC budgetcrisis and give Bonn scope to keep up its opposition to the ECexecutive commission's farm policy reform plans, politicalsources said.    EC finance and farm minsters held an unprecedented jointsession in Luxembourg today to try to solve the stalemate overfuture farm financing.    West Germany has proved the main obstacle to Commissionattempts to raise fresh funds for farm financing by taxingimports of vegetable oil and fats, for fear of U.S.retaliation.    Bonn has also opposed the abolition of an agri-monetarymechanism that acts as a subsidy for West German farm exports.    The draft legislation, which the ruling centre-rightcoalition will present to parliament tomorrow, would providetemporary credits for farm subsidies usually paid by Brussels.    The Commission, facing a five billion European CurrencyUnits (5.73 billion dlrs) budget deficit by the end of theyear, has threatened to start phasing out payment of somesubsidies and premiums from August, unless EC member statestake urgent measures to provide fresh funds.    West German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle gave the newlegislation top priority after last month's failure to agree toa farm price package for 1986/87.    Political sources in Bonn said Kiechle decided to take thesting out of proposed Commission measures to cut back subsidiesby creating a buffer for West German farmers.    The opposition SPD has agreed to back the Kiechle bill andallow its hasty passage through parliament by July 1, ahead ofthe summer recess, SPD sources said.    SPD farm policy spokesman Jan Oostergetelo said his partywould support the bill, even though it would further swellmassive government spending on agriculture. He said the billwas an admission that the government believes the farm pricetalks will fail and the EC faces bankruptcy.    According to a copy of the draft bill obtained by Reuters,government authorities will have over two billion marks (1.1billion dlrs) available to pay farmers advance subsidies andpremiums for grains and other crops harvested this summer.    The Commission has agreed to pay the subsidies eventually.But paying farmers on time will cost Bonn about 100 mln marks(55 mln dlrs) in interest payments, farm policy sources said.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet is expected to support thebill when it meets tomorrow. Reuter
EC CONSIDERS NEW PROPOSALS TO END FARM DEADLOCK The European Community (EC) executiveCommission will today urgently consider whether to take a newinitiative to break the current deadlock over reform of thebloc's farm policy and to ease its budgetary crisis.    The Commission will meet in Strasbourg following whatdiplomats described as a largely fruitless special jointmeeting of farm and finance ministers on the issue inLuxembourg Monday.    Commission officials said farm commissioner FransAndriessen will ask the 17-man body for permission to presentfarm ministers with a compromise plan revising proposals for1987/88 farm prices which have divided them since they werefirst announced in March.    The most controversial aspects of these proposals are aplan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to financerapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measureswhich would change the way common EC farm prices are convertedinto member state currencies.    West German delegation sources, who have opposed both plansfiercely, said if the Commission dropped the oils and fats taxplan and modified the currency proposals, there would be achance of agreement on other aspects of the package.      These include measures to cut the effective price paid tofarmers for cereals and some other crops by over 10 pct.      But a Commission spokesman said any new proposals wouldinclude plans for revising the current oils and fats andcurrency regulations.     The Commission is anxious to avoid a complete deadlock inmeetings of EC farm ministers here this week as it fears issuescould then be referred to the EC heads of government summit atthe end of the month.    Commission president Jacques Delors, who wants to ensurethe summit has ample time to consider proposals for new meansof financing the cash-strapped EC, said yesterday it would be"disastrous" if farm issues had to be discussed by governmentleaders.    However, with a five billion European Currency Unit (5.75billion dollar) EC budget deficit almost inevitable this year,the Commission will be wary of making major concessions to thetraditionally free-spending farm ministers, diplomats said    Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens, who chairedyesterday's joint meeting of ministers, said afterwards someaspects of the farm price package will almost certainly have tobe referred to the summit.    Although Delors' aides described the joint meeting asuseful in clarifying the issues, some diplomats said it seemedto have merely confirmed member states' long held positions.    Indeed, they said an extra state, Spain, seemed to havelined up with the four others already opposing the oils andfats tax, West Germany, Britain, Denmark and Portugal. Reuter
EC COMMISSION MODIFIES OILS TAX PLAN The EC Commission has proposed amodified plan for a tax on marine and vegetable oils and fatsin its revised 1987/88 farm price proposals, an officialdocument detailing the proposals shows.    The document, made available to journalists, says thecommission proposes that the tax should start at levelsoriginally proposed for vegetable oils on October 1.    However, the tax on marine oils and fats would be cut by 50pct from originally envisaged levels, the document said.    In addition, the Commission proposes that the level of thetax, expected to start at 330 Ecus per tonne, could be reviewedevery three months rather than annually.    Diplomatic sources said the change to the proposals forfish oils appears to be an attempt to overcome objections tothe tax from Portugal and Spain, major fishing nations.    Other countries opposing the tax include Britain, WestGermany and Denmark.    The new proposals retain most of the Commission's originalplans in other sectors.    However, they mark the Commission's recognition that itcannot get proposals to reduce the period of intervention forcereals, diplomats said.    Instead the Commission proposes to cut the monthlyincrements applied to cereals during the November to May periodwhen intervention is open to 2.7 Ecus a tonne for durum wheatand two Ecus a tonne for other cereals.    The document shows the Commission has also changed itsgreen currency proposals in the light of heavy opposition,notably from West Germany.    West German and Dutch positive monetary compensatoryamounts (MCAs) would be immediately cut by 0.5 points, with afurther one point cut at the beginning of the 1988/89 season.    The Commission originally proposed a complete dismantlingof positive MCAs.     For other countries, the Commission makes the followingproposals for dismantling negative MCAs     Denmark and Benelux - reduction of around 1.5 points foranimal products and just over two points for crops.     France and Ireland - proposals unchanged except for anextra 1.5 point cut for beef.     Italy - dismantling of all MCAs except those created sinceJanuary 12.    Britain - five point cut for most products, 6.5 points forbeef.    Greece, Spain and Portugal - for most products, dismantlingof seven, 14 and 5.5 points respectively. Reuter
DUTCH PARLIAMENT BACKS STAND AGAINST OILS TAX Dutch parliamentary parties havere-affirmed their support for the government's opposition tothe proposed European Community tax on oils and fats,parliamentarians said.    A broad cross-section of members of parliament voiced theiropposition to the tax during a debate in the lower houseyesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the U.S.And on the potentially damaging effect on Third Worldcountries.    State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Rene Van Der Lindensaid the government was against the tax although it noteddeepening EC financial difficulties.    "It is difficult to be against the tax and against extrafinance. The EC members have to make a choice," Van Der Lindensaid.    However, he denied the government had dropped itsopposition to the proposed tax or altered its position. REUTER
RPT - OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX INTACT - MINISTER A minority group of EuropeanCommunity countries strong enough to block the adoption of atax on vegetable and marine oils and fats is still intact afterthe EC Commission proposed changes to its proposals earliertoday, British agriculture minister John MacGregor toldjournalists.    He said Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands and Denmarkcontinue to oppose the tax after the Commission proposed makingit temporary and promising compensation to any third countrieswhose exports suffered.

DUTCH CONSUMERS/INDUSTRY SEE VEG OILS TAX THREAT Dutch consumers and food processorswould be hit hard by the proposed EC tax on oils and fats, Dickde Bruyn, chairman of the commodity board for margarine, fatsand oils, MVO, said at the annual meeting.    The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine andfourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC.    The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers andsteeply increase the costs of industries such as potatoprocessing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de Bruyn said.    "A move by these industries to countries outside the ECcannot be ruled out," he added.    De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fatswould be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugelyexpensive administratively.    He also said the proposed tax contravened not only articlethree of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), theLome Convention, and the United Nations Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAO) guidelines, but also the EC's own Treaty.    The proposed tax would not only be inflationary but alsohave consequences for employment and investment, he added. Reuter
EC PRESIDENCY PREPARED TO DROP OILS AND FATS TAX Belgium, current holder of the EuropeanCommunity presidency, appears ready to drop a controversialoils and fats tax from this year's hotly-contested farm pricepackage, diplomats said.    In a discussion document prepared for today's summitmeeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called"stabilising mechanism" be the subject of "further study andconsultation with the Community's main trading partners."    The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne onboth imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marineoils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.    The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row atthe summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm pricetalks, contained the first formal reference to dropping themeasure.    Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency onJune 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They aresupported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesserextent, Spain.    Although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomatssaid, the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for afurther six months was certain to survive any redrafting. REUTER
EC FARM MINISTERS TO MEET TOMORROW AFTER SUMMIT European Community agricultureministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of atwo-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attemptto agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commissionspokesman said.    He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will containnotice of special agricultural measures of a purely technicalnature which will come into effect on July 1 unless theministers reach an accord.    The spokesman declined to detail these special measures butsaid they would not be the sort of "dynamic" moves which EC FarmCommissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in thecase of complete deadlock among farm ministers.    These moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting ofministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, ECsources said.    Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals pricesby seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sourcessaid.    EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 stillsplit over the Commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable andmarine oils and fats.    In addition, West Germany said it would veto plans forcereal price cuts and for a change in the green currencysystem.    Earlier today, diplomats said Belgium, the current holderof the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop theplans for the controversial oils and fats tax. REUTER
FRANCO-GERMAN PARLEY FAILS TO UNBLOCK FARM TALKS A specially convened Franco-Germanmeeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed tomake any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that hasdeeply split the two former EC allies, diplomats said    The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreignministers from both countries and by French President FrancoisMitterand, his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, and by ChancellorHelmut Kohl of West Germany.    The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key toproviding a solution to a long-term settlement of theCommunity's worst-ever budget crisis.    "The Germans clearly do not want to budge," an aide to Chiractold reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visiblyangered as he the hour-long meeting.    Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal forthe Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically theEC's complex "green" currrency system, designed to translatecommon EC farm prices into national currencies.    Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax whichWest Germany is against, along with Britain, Denmark and theNetherlands.    EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on thepackage, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadlinetomorrow.    Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could haveinjected fresh impetus into those talks.    The Commission proposed its package to save one billiondollars on the EC's ever-rising farm budget.    The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves toalter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, andplugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987. Reuter
LYNG SAYS INDIA FOOD AID PACKAGE NOT READY The United States and India havenot yet agreed on a food aid package to help thedrought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said.    Lyng told Reuters in an interview that the two countrieshave been discussing a package but that he did not expect thespecifics of the offer to be announced during Indian PrimeMinister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week.    "We have been talking about the potential needs that Indiamight have for both their commercial market and purchases needsas well as the possibilities of assistance," Lyng said.    "At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. Theamounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we haveindicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist inwhatever way they deem most valuable," he said.    There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA wouldoffer India subsidized vegetable oil under the exportenhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419of an amended 1949 law.    Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agreeon the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and thatWashington would prefer the package include something otherthan donated food.    "The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking careof themselves. India is a country that has come a long way inits ability to produce food and they have a great pride inthat," Lyng said.    "We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses westill have of many commodities..., would like to share in theimport business the Indians do, and then we have some, as wealways do, compassion for the people of India and would like tocooperate with them," he said.    Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officialsduring Gandhi's visit here, adding, "I just don't know ofanything that might be announced specifically."    Asked if "the ball was in the Indians' court," he said, "Yes."    Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening. Reuter
COPA URGES TAX ON VEGETABLE PROTEINS The European Community's farmers'pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a taxon vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats taxwhich has already been proposed by the EC Commission.    Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference onTuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanismfor cereal substitutes.    He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with theDanish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chairmeetings of their EC colleagues.    Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would helpthe EC's budget problems and would provide some price stabilityfor producers.    This would in turn help the market position for certaincrops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peasand beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severeoutput restrictions.    A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats taxon imported and domestically produced oils and marine fatssucceeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual ECprice fixing.    However, the EC Commission has said it maintains itsproposals for a tax.    Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursueinternational negotiations on farm trade with the aim ofbridging the gap between EC and world prices. Reuter
