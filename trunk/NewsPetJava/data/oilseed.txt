FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT The sharp decline in soybean crush ratiosseen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, haspushed margins below the cost of production at most soybeanprocessing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybeanmeal and oil.    The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by theNational Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen overthe past two months when crush margins surged to the bestlevels seen in over a year.    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushedsoybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in theweekly crush number.    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surgein shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the nextfew months.    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feeddemand is very light for this time of year due to the milderthan normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices inan attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recentweeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in thenearby March contract today.    "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and soldMay, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crushtrader said.    "But they've been bailing out this week because the Marchhas been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if nottomorrow, then later in the month," he added.    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crushratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents perbushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last twodays.    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so noprocessors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitablelevel, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cutback production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.    With futures down, processors are finding they must bidpremiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 centsfor every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, downsharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and belowthe average cost of production, cash dealers said.    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, withlittle talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. Butprocessors will start halting production in the next few weeksit they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added. Reuter

JAPAN BUYS SOME 95,000 TONNES SOYBEANS FROM CHINA Japanese importers bought some 95,000tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to Septembershipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sourcessaid.    The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrsfrom the premium for the November to April shipment, but downfrom 13.80 for the last May to September shipment.    Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures pricesin Chicago plus the FOB premium.    Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spotbuying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.    Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected toremain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, thesources said.    In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chineseedible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers,but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase ofChinese origin beans for crushing, they said.

INDONESIAN SOYBEAN IMPORTS FORECAST TO RISE Soybean imports are forecast to rise to425,000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated300,000 in 1986/87 and 375,000 in 1985/86, the U.S. Embassysaid in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture.    It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal ofself-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because itdid not meet a planned increase in area planted and becauseyields have remained below target.    Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000tonnes in 1985/86.    Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.    Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but torise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due tocome on stream in early 1988.    China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while theU.S. Provides the rest, it said.    "This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 sincedomestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and arewilling to pay a premium for them," it said.    Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both1986/87 and 1987/88.    "Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficientsupply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems,"the report said. REUTER

YEUTTER BLASTS PROPOSED EC OILS AND FATS TAX U.S. trade representative ClaytonYeutter today said that if the European Community's Council ofMinisters approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, anothermajor transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture.    In a statement issued by the trade representative's officefollowing a speech to the American Soybean Association's boardof directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severeimpact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billiondlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.    "This is an unacceptable situation for us and its(vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but tovigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access tothe European market," Yeutter said.    Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violateEC obligations under the GATT.    He said the effect of the tax would be to double the priceof soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarinemade from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine,and closer in price to expensive European butter.    "I am astonished that the EC commission would propose sucha provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolvedthe agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC toinclude Spain and Portugal," Yeutter said.    "It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontationalcourse before the recent wounds have healed and as we arebeginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of globaltrade talks)," he said.

CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS Chicago Board of trade grain traders andanalysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned tohandle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of newcrop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeansin the futures markets.    Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers willbe more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans becausecorn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That givesdeficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if theysign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thingrather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new cropsoybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans moreattractive under normal circumstances.    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift thelimited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mlnmore oat acres this year than last without being penalized,traders said.    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking ofshifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to themore attractive deal from the government, they added.    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just sixmonths ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South toput soybean land back into cotton.    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybeanproduction in recent years has been a general shift of acres intraditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST Torrential rains throughoutArgentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarsegrain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.    Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularlyaffected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid tosoybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April orMay.    The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghumcrops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yieldsand cut the total volume of this year's harvest.    Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.    No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.    Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume ofthe coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.    Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central SantaFe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct oftotal planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.    Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest wasestimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two toseven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the1985/86 harvest.    Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according toofficial figures.    The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and ninepct of total planted area.    Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowersfor this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figureof 3.14 mln hectares.    Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mlnand 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the1985/86 harvest.    Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two andfour pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mlnhectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.    Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.    Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit arecord 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figuresput last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.    Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very goodcondition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.    Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest isexpected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares. Reuter
AMERICAN FARM BUREAU OPPOSES FARM BILL CHANGES The directors of the American FarmBureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesdayto urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place withoutalterations.    "We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,"said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has beenin place for just a little over a year and in our judgmentthere is more to be gained at the present time from maintainingthe legislation.    "Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farmbill is better on balance than any of the alternatives beingadvanced," Kleckner said.    The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much ashe deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeanscompetitive in the world market.    A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should beeligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIKcertificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel andthe new loan rate.    The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiencypayments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheatbecause of adverse weather. Reuter
USDA WOULD SCRAP COTTON, RICE, BEAN PRICE FLOORS The package of proposed farm policychanges that the Reagan administration sent to Congress todayincludes a provision that would eliminate minimum price supportlevels for upland cotton, rice and soybeans.    The package, obtained by Reuters, also includes aprovision, outlined in advance by USDA officials, that wouldincrease the annual permissible cut in the basic price supportlevels for all major crops to 10 pct from five pct.    Under current law, the basic support prices for uplandcotton, rice and soybeans between 1987 and 1990 cannot be cutbelow 50 cents per lb, 6.50 dlrs per hundredweight and 4.50dlrs per bushel, respectively.

SOYBEAN GROUP HEAD URGES USDA ACTION ON LOAN The Agriculture Department must makea decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loanor more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to thegovernment and foreign soybean production will increase, thepresident of the American Soybean Association, ASA, said.    "The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another... USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) asmuch as they want, but they have to eventually address thisproblem," David Haggard, ASA president, told Reuters.    USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, andAgriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on thesoybean loan, Haggard said.    "I don't know if USDA is really very serious aboutaddressing the soybean loan problem," he said.    At ASA's annual winter board of directors meeting here, ASAleaders refused to change their official position on the  loan-- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs.    The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson,R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment.    Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backedproposals have but said, "in all honesty, we do not want to seethe farm bill be torn apart."    He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition toa market loan, there are still numerous ways the USDA couldchange the loan without new legislation.    Making the loan partially in certificates which would nothave to be paid back would be one option, he said. Reuter
CHINA ADDS, CANCELS WHEAT COMMITMENTS - USDA China has added 90,000 tonnes of U.S.wheat to its purchases for delivery in the 1987/88 season andcancelled 30,000 tonnes of wheat purchases for delivery in the1986/87 season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.

USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES  Corn sales gained 2,494,900 tonnes inthe week ended February 26, the highest weekly total sinceAugust 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week'slevel, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department saidsales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reportedunder the daily reporting system -- were the first sales fordelivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSRGrains Supply Agreement, which began October 1.    Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and salesto unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.    Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half fromthe previous week's combined sales, it said.    Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers fordelivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1.    Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled thepreceding week, but were nearly a third below the four weekaverage. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexicoand Italy, it said.    Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct lessthan the four week average.    Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy andAustralia were partially offset by declines to unknowndestinations.    Soybean oil sales of 5,400 tonnes were the result ofincreases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes forunknown destinations.    Combined sales activity in cotton of 75,200 running bales-- 44,700 bales for the current year and 30,500 bales for the1987/88  bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's goodshowing, the department said.

BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS Brazil's recent announcement of asuspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreigndebt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed viewsamong many international economists and commodities analyststhat Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.    The developing world's most indebted nation is also itsmost prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such ascoffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchangerevenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.    "That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is noway they can trade their way out of this situation," AldoRoldan, Vice President for International Services at ChaseEconometrics, said.    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle theproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on gluttedworld markets, but also had to work to make its position onforeign exchange markets more profitable.    "Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) andexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchangerates," Roldan said.    The Chase economist also said commodities markets weredepressed and generally did not appear very promising for acountry like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23billion dlrs.    But he added: "They are always pretty aggressive and theyhave good foreign marketing channels."    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will becoffee, and even without background pressure from foreigncreditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit themarket this year with a vengeance.    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke upearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusingeach other of intransigence.    "Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,which others wanted changed," one senior coffee dealer said.    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted topreserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he saidBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and otherswould suffer.    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario butas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, thedealer said.    "If they do come into the market at this level it will golower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,"he said.    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 centslower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distantdeliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Daustertold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil hasno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown ofthe ICO talks on export quotas.    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be thefocus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. "Theywill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,"according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc.    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plusdifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of theBrazil soybean crop. "Brazilian farmers also need cash flow andthey can't afford to store the crops," he said.    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some timeabout large South American crops developing under near idealconditions towards record yields.    "We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier thanusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports," Loewy said.    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American SoybeanAssociation (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvestcould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when pricesare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to thevulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of areduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered tofarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about thesoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for pricesby keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers canforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay theloan.    "We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) arestarting to harvest and starting to export," Eshleman said. Buthe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.    Jose Melicias from the research department of DrexelBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as muchas it can this year because of its economic situation.    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. "TheBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay forstorage," he added.    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazilwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias saidit would not make a big difference.    On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may bemuted no matter its need to generate capital.    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, whichcould limit exports to the world market, analysts said. Thecountry may have oversold and be unable to honor exportcommitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused byconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, willgive it little room to stretch exports, they said.    Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year ofsurplus. "Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year itfell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa andfind many more markets for it," one analyst said.    "If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market wouldcollapse and they can't afford to do that," she added. Reuter

JAPAN MAY INCREASE ITS BRAZILIAN SOYBEAN PURCHASES Japanese crushers are likely to buy atleast 200,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans this year andanother 100,000 to 200,000 if quality and shipping conditionsare good against 128,089 tonnes in 1986, trade sources said.    A Japanese trading house recently bought about 31,000tonnes of soybeans for April 10/May 10 shipment, they said.

VEGETABLE OILS MAY TIGHTEN DESPITE SEED SURPLUS Lower production of coconutand palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocksthis year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseedsanalyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.    Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at AlbertaAgriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the worldvegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.    "Prices for edible oils appear to have more upsidepotential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedenteddecline in the production of tree oils," Balletto said.    Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palmkernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mlntonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.    He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearanceat 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.    Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said,disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.    "If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting thecrush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing inthe edible oils sector could develop," he said.    "This would be relatively favorable for the prices of highoil yielding seeds," Balletto said.    Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed pricesbecause of burdensome supplies, he said.    World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increasefor the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes,compared with 25.4 mln last year.    The increase should result from lower disappearance, asproduction is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7mln last year, he said.    World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mlntonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said,while production of other oilseeds was lower.    Higher soybean production in South America and Europe madeup for lower production in the United States, he said.    Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S.stocks make up most of those, Balletto said.    The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes,about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.    Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased13.1 mln tonnes.    "During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire worldsurplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificiallyhigh prices caused by the U.S. loan program."    "Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseedsprices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as longas the U.S. soybean surplus continues.    For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in arange tied to the U.S. loan program.    "Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supplyoverhang while strong underlying support is provided by theU.S. loan rate."    The problem is likely to become worse as the artificiallyhigh prices encourage producers in South America, Canada andAustralia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said. Reuter

BIG U.S. CONSERVATION ENROLLMENT EXPECTED Enrollment in the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's fourth conservation signup is expected to beannounced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may behigher than total enrollment for the first three signups.    Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres,USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far inthe 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.    Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres intothe program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA'sAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at acongressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will beaccepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.    As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area isexpected to attract the greatest enrollment.    "The Great Plains area will be the predominate area whichwe'll get signup in," a USDA conservation specialist said.    Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of theacreage pulled from that area, he said.    Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreagein the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production,but the USDA source said this would be a relatively smallpercent of the total.    A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll partof their corn base acreage into the program has sparked moreinterest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.    Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to takeland out of production for 10 years. The average rent paymentaccepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre. Reuter
MORE HEAVY RAINS IN ARGENTINE GRAIN AREAS Heavy rains fell again inArgentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday,trade sources said.    Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularlyhigh volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa andSanta Fe provinces.    Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires,heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in LaPampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe.Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.    Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mmin Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm inChaco.    Growers said it was still too early to tell whether therains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflowercrops may have suffered.    Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed bythe bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rainswould have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allowfarm machinery to operate.    The rains caused flooding in western and northwesternBuenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areasthere since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.    Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares,Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said afterflying over the flooded area.    Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said largeparts of the flooded areas were not planted because they arelow-lying and flood easily.    Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by theheavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent ofthe damage. They said it was likely rain combined with highwinds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.    The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and southof Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolatedareas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pcta week ago.    Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop wererevised downward in light of the bad weather.    Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes,down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mlntonnes.    Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a weekago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated aweek ago.    Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes,according to official figures.    Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mlntonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mlntonnes, according to official figures.

U.S. SOYBEAN MARKETING LOAN NOT NEEDED - LYNG U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no presentpurpose because the U.S. price is not above the world price.

However, the USDA secretary said that if current conditionsof surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate toconsider a marketing loan.

GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0/92 FARM PLAN Implementation of a one-year 0/92pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promotedtoday by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommitteeas a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmersanother option when making their planting decisions.    "We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame,but we are locked into this," said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains. "We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt thefarmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both."    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 billfor 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickmansaid that it will probably be introduced next week.    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer toforego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiencypayment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided underthe current bill.    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meetbudget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better thansharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply adifferent type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from governmentpayments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at thispoint, he said.    "I don't think there is any interest in pursuing adecoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal," Glickman saidat the hearing.    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of theBoren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. Hisplan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment toparticipating farmers, require that idled acreage be put toconservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extraidled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acresin a county and provide tenant protection provisions.    "I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, butwe can at least move in that direction," Boschwitz said.    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testifiedin favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current biasin U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'dependency on the government, he said.    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnsonsaid, and would still encourage farmers to plant.    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association andthe National Cattlemen's Association said their groups opposeany 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening thefarm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.    But when asked if his association were forced to choosebetween a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, LarryJohnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

U.S. MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE-BOSCHWITZ A marketing loan for U.S. wheat,feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplusproduction situation and would be extremely costly, Sen.

Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of amarketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focusedsupport on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.

The USSR has purchased 1.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn fordelivery in the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR grain agreement.     Total shipments in the third year of the U.S.-USSR grainsagreement, which ended September 30, amounted to 152,600 tonnesof wheat, 6,808,100 tonnes of corn and 1,518,700 tonnes ofsoybeans.    Shipments to the USSR in the second year of the agreeementamounted to 2,887,200 tonnes of wheat and 15,750,100 tonnes ofcorn.    Reuter
U.S. SOY PRODUCERS THINK EC OILS TAX UNLIKELY American soybean producers areconfident the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetableoils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing tochance, American Soybean Association (ASA) president-electWayne Bennett said.    Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean producerdelegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, was speaking ata lunch.    After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries thismorning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it wouldvote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries.    "Our information suggests we will have the required numberof votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward,"he said.    "The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20years, and dropped every time. What we want now is to kill itonce and for all," Bennett added.    Backing up the soybean producers' active lobbying, the U.S.Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliatewith penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, hesaid.    The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fightthe proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.    U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account forone-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billiondlrs a year, Bennett said.    The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producersbadly while at the same time virtually doubling the price ofsoyoil in the EC, which would suffer far worse than otherhigher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax,he added.    The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used tofinance the EC's own oilseed subsidy machine, he said.    "We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeatthe Wine Equity Act two years ago, but we will not stand by andwatch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist ECmeasures," Bennett said.    "The mood in the U.S. Is turning increasingly protectionist,and the EC's actions are fueling the chances of a trade war,"he added. Reuter

USDA DETAILS CONSERVATION CROP ENROLLMENT Farmers enrolled over 6.5 mln acresof program crops in the latest conservation reserve programsignup and around four mln acres of non-program crops,Agriculture Department conservation specialists said.    Soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of thenon-program crop acreage enrolled, a USDA analyst said. Heavyenrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a bigpercentage would be fallow and non-soybean land, accounted fora large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said.    Wheat and corn acreage comprised slightly over 40 pct ofthe total 10,572,402 acres accepted into the ten-year program.    USDA analysts gave the following enrollment breakdown:    -- wheat  2,615,140 acres    -- corn   1,894,764 acres    -- barley   705,888 acres    -- sorghum  585,552 acres    -- cotton   417,893 acres    -- rice       2,035 acres    -- peanuts      611 acres    -- tobacco      285 acres    -- total program crops  6,512,700 acres    -- total nonprogram     4,059,702 acres    -- total enrollment    10,572,402 acres    USDA analysts are currently working on a complete statebreakdown of crop acreage enrollment and should have it readyfor publication later this week, they said.

SOYBEAN GROUPS MEET WITH LYNG TO DISCUSS LOAN A high-level meeting last week whichincluded the Secretary of Agriculture and other senior  USDAofficials, along with leaders of the major soybean lobbyinggroups, failed to reach any decision on what should be doneabout the soybean loan level, participants at the meeting toldReuters.    "We didn't feel a lot was accomplished last week, but wewere delighted to meet with the Secretary, and he didn't closethe door on anything," a member of the soybean delegation said.    At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that atthe present level of 4.77 dlrs (without Gramm-Rudmanreductions) it encourages foreign soybean production by makingsoybeans more profitable to grow than corn.    But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high inrelation with corn, soybean groups have pledged their supportto maintaining current price supports for soybean growers.    Leaders of the American Soybean Association and theNational Soybean Processors Association offered specific loanoptions to USDA Secretary Lyng in last week's meeting, butparticipants would not reveal what those options were.    "There were no surprises in our package," one participantsaid. Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea ofoffering producers soybean loans partially in cash and incertificates.    The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4.77 loan with77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would nothave to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash.    This would have the effect of lowering the world price,maintaining domestic support levels and reducing thegovernment's soybean inventory.    A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at lastweek's meeting, participants said.    One member of the soybean delegation said that the meetingwas a "listening session" for USDA, and that the proposals willnow be studied further by the Department.    USDA officials, however, would not commit to any timeframe. Participants in the meeting do not look for changes inthe soybean loan to be announced in the near future.    "USDA is very sensitive about saying anything that couldinfluence the market, so the Secretary was very non-committal,"a participant said. Reuter
EC COMMISSION DEFENDS FARM PROGRAM The European Community's (EC)executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of itsambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farmsurpluses, after strong attacks from northern states.    Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands andDenmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats whichhas already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC ledby the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said.    But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen toldjournalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree thetax, proposed last month as part of the Commission's annualfarm price package, would leave a large hole in the group'sbudget.    He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mindup for good. "I hope the debate is still open, if not there willbe a formidable hole in the budget," he said.    The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 andwould be only slightly less this year, he said.    Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax aheadof farm ministers in a move described by diplomats asunprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministersrecognised the importance of reforming the EC's farm policy.    The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extracash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levelsand to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption bymaking it more competitive with other oils.    Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oilproducers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by thetax.    "What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be betterunderstood not just outside the community but at home," he said.    Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in theEC's costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal toimpose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fatscould seriously damage the EC's trade relations with othercountries.    Britain also warned that the tax could hit developingcountries already receiving aid from the EC, they said.    The Commission also defended proposals to dismantleMonetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross bordersubsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuationsfor farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism.    In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to ECexecutive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clearsuch a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers.    Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism atthe talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany hadbeen alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect ofthe Commission's farm price proposals, he added.   Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid theEC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portugueseopposition.    The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes ofunwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning itinto animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices.    National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out ofsavings from another plan to curb milk production.    Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by thescheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massivesurpluses built up before they joined the community last year,but the two countries did not block today's vote.

BRAZIL CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA Wet weather covered Rio Grande doSul, Brazil in the week ended March 14, benefitting soybeanswhich are mostly setting to filling pods, the JointAgricultural weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture andCommerce Departments said.    In its International Weather and Crop Summary, the agencysaid minimal precipitation covered soybean areas in SantaCatarina, Parana, and southern Matto Grosso do Sul.    Adequate soil moisture in these areas met crop moisturedemands, reducing the potential for crop stress, it said.    The agency said February precipitation was above normalover most soybean areas of Brazil.    Weekly temperatures were below normal, it said. Reuter
FARM PROGRAM CHANGES OUTLINED BY USDA OFFICIAL Upcoming changes being considered inthe U.S. Agriculture Department's transportation and loanprograms were outlined by a USDA official today.    Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain andFeed Association, Tom VonGarlem, assistant deputy administratorfor USDA's state and county operations, said the followingchanges are under consideration by USDA.    Termination of USDA's Transportation Assistance Program forwheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week.    Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also underconsideration, VonGarlem said. While the department has notmade any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grainin reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said.    Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for nextyear's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loanspartially in cash and in certificates under consideration.    VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 cropprogram signup, saying he sees no reason to do so at this time.    He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonusunder the Conservation Reserve Program. Reuter
ARGENTINE MAIZE, SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL Argentine grain growers reducedtheir estimates for maize and soybean production in the currentharvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.    Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reachbetween 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnesestimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated inmid-February.    But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, accordingto official figures, and would be a new record.    The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was arecord 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pctcompared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.    The change in yield estimates is due to very hightemperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year inthe soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe andnorthern Buenos Aires province.    The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybeanpods empty, especially in Cordoba.    Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, sincerainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.    Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak inBuenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. Therewas no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields wereable to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recentweeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,sunflower and sorghum harvesting.    Crops were considered in generally good condition, thoughit is still too early to judge whether the intense rains ofrecent weeks caused any long-term damage.    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of thetotal area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.    Total production for the current maize harvest is expectedto reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mlntonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pctlower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,according to official figures.    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct oftotal planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was twoto 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.    The current harvest's volume was again expected to bebetween 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower thanlast harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers fearedthat heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll oncrops and, consequently, on total production volume.    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct oftotal planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mlnhectares planted in the previous harvest.    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvestremained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mlntonnes. Reuter
U.S. SOYBEANS HAVE COMPETITIVE PROBLEM - AMSTUTZ Soybeans produced in the UnitedStates face a competitive price problem because of the loanrate provisions of the 1985 farm bill, U.S. Undersecretary ofAgriculture Daniel Amstutz said.    Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriationssubcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a "squeeze"because the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rateswhile limiting the soybean reduction.    As a result, he said U.S.-produced soybeans "have a priceproblem" in competing with other soybean producing countries.    Amstutz called the situation a "dilemma" for the USDA, andsaid "we have spent hours in ASCS (Agriculture Stabilizationand Conservation Service) looking at this."    He did not say what may be done to rectify the situation. Reuter
U.S. DELEGATION HOPES FOR VEG OILS TAX DEFEAT American soybean producers and processorsare hoping the proposed EC tax on vegetable oils and fats willnot be imposed, but say the U.S. Is prepared to retaliate if itis introduced.    Wayne Bennett, the American Soybean Association's firstvice president, told a news conference the U.S. Administrationwould not hesitate to retaliate, but both producers andprocessors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation.    U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letterto EC officials that U.S. Retaliatory measures would cover morethan agricultural products if the tax was imposed, Bennettsaid.    The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association (NSPA)delegations will meet top West German government officialstoday and tomorrow to lobby for support.    Bennett said West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands,Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax, but Italy and Belgium seemto have taken a hardline view on the issue.    "Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to theiradvantage economically, but that is not correct because wewould hit back," NSPA chairman Jack Reed said.    This step would be very expensive for all and no one wouldemerge as a winner if the tax were introduced, he said.    Reed pointed out the U.S. Administration and the soybeanindustry view the EC proposal as violating the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.    The proposed tax also violates the zero duty bindingsagreed between the EC and U.S. In 1962, he said.    Under the zero duty bindings pact U.S. Soybeans andproducts can be exported to the Community duty-free. REUTER
CONGRESSMEN URGE U.S. SOYBEAN PROGRAM CHANGES Several leading farm-stateCongressmen said they will press the U.S. AgricultureDepartment to implement some kind of marketing loan to makesoybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income.    Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairmanDan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen andrepresentatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on thesubject in the next two weeks.    "Let's see if we can try to push them (USDA) to dosomething without legislation," Glickman told the hearing.    The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs perbushel with no income protection, or marketing loan.    David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, presidentsaid USDA must make changes in the soybean program.    The current soybean program "gave us the worst of bothworlds," ASA's Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate istoo high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion ofsoybean production in South America, he said. At the same time,the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any incomesupport for soybean farmers, Haggard said.    "We need some kind of market loan," he added.    The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the AgricultureSecretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDAso far has resisted pressure to use the authority.    Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA,but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if theywould seriously consider offering a marketing loan.    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said thesoybean situation is a "dilemna" which has been studiedextensively by the department. But he did not say what, if anychanges, are under consideration.    In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways otherthan a marketing loan which should be considered to helpsoybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment,or a direct payment program.    Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity CreditCorporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will riseto 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu ofsoybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.    "Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entiresoybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987," Haggard said.    However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious inmaking soybean program changes that might allow the EuropeanCommunity to challenge the U.S. program under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.    He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybeanproduction and loss of that market would be devastating.    The Reagan administration has given "mixed signals" onwhether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could besuccessfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.    While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per buloan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorseda proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a sixdlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.    The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the rankingRepublican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. EdwardMadigan of Illinois.    Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to takesome action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loancould mean a substantial increase in budget costs.    Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut oneto 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and thereforemust fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.    Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bucombined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price mightfall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost thegovernment a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costswould decline as market prices recovered. Reuter
E.C. OFFICIAL SAYS FATE OF VEG OIL TAX UNCERTAIN Whether the European Community'sCouncil of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetableoils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain,an EC official said.    "It is very far from certain that it will go through," SirRoy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, toldreporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association.    Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and WestGermany has opposed it in the past.    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatenedretaliation if the tax is approved, as it would limit U.S.soybean exports to the EC. Council action is expected soon.    Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate aboutagriculture in a new round of trade talks, it is unwilling tosingle out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or putagricultural policy on a special fast track.    "The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in theframing of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)wording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers onboth sides of the Atlantic," he said.

BONN EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR U.S. ON EC VEG OIL TAX The West German government expressedsupport for the U.S. Position in opposing the proposed EuropeanCommunity tax on vegetable oils and fats, a U.S. Embassyspokesman said.

Several top government officials told the American SoybeanAssociation and the National Soybean Processors Associationdelegations there was no reason for American producers andprocessors to pay for EC agriculture, the spokesman said.    European agriculture was facing severe problems, but boththe Community and the U.S. Should work closely within theframework provided by the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade, he said.    The delegations will continue their top level meetings inBonn today but will not issue a statement before returning tothe U.S. At the weekend.

U.S. EXPORT INSPECTIONS, IN THOUS BUSHELS  SOYBEANS 13,417 WHEAT 12,003 COR West Germany's banking authoritiesare being drawn into the currency scandal surroundingVolkswagen AG <VOWG.F> as the repercussions and allegations inthe financial community widen, banking sources said.    The Bundesbank has seconded one of its currency experts tohelp the state prosecutor investigating the currency fraud atVolkswagen, VW, in Brunswick, a Bundesbank spokesman said.    The Federal Banking Supervisory Office in West Berlin alsois considering press allegations that several banks "parked" openpositions with VW, breaching banking regulations.    Earlier this month Volkswagen said it had incurredpotential losses of 480 mln marks in an alleged fraud involvingthe hedging of open currency positions.    The foreign exchange activities of a large non-bankcorporation would not normally attract the attention of WestGerman banking regulators.    Their strict foreign exchange rules, set up after theHerstatt banking crash in 1974, apply only to banks.    "This strict banking supervision aims to protect specialinterests -- creditors and depositors," the Bundesbank spokesmansaid, adding company shareholders were not covered.    "The Volkswagen case, in so far as it involves Volkswagen'snormal foreign exchange business, lies far outside the area ofthe Bundesbank," he said.    The Bundesbank's decision to send a currency expert toBrunswick to help investigations into activities involvingVolkswagen's foreign exchange dealing room was part of thenormal assistance rendered by one public authority to another.    The expert will count as part of the state prosecutor'sstaff and not report back to the Bundesbank, he said.    But the Bundesbank could get more closely involved inallegations that banks used VW to circumvent regulations.    Section 1a of the Banking Law requires banks at the closeof business each day to hold no more than 30 pct of theircapital and reserves in open positions.    The section was introduced after the Herstatt bank crash in1974 due to currency speculation.    The Platow Brief financial newsletter said on Friday thatabout 16 banks, mainly foreign, had been circumventing section1a by "parking" such excess open positions with VW.    This would mean that the bank concerned would sell theposition temporarily to VW, buying it back a day or so later.    However, such repurchase agreements are expressly includedin section 1a as still counting as open positions.    A spokesman for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office inWest Berlin said it was following the allegations butinvestigations were difficult because the 16 banks had not beennamed. He declined to say what steps were being taken.    But banking sources said the Supervisory Office as aninitial step had approached the Platow Brief for the identityof the banks, but this had been refused. The Platow Briefdeclined comment.    If the Supervisory Office ascertains that the bankingregulations have been infringed, it will pursue the case withthe assistance of the Bundesbank.    The Office, subordinate to the Finance Ministry, does nothave branches outside Berlin.    The independent Bundesbank however operates 203 branches inWest Germany, closely monitoring local banks.    Banks deposit statistics, including currency position data,once a month with the Bundesbank's regional administrations atfederal state level, the Landeszentralbanken (LZBs).    Currency dealers said parking excess positions withnon-banking corporates was frequent practice.    Such positions would often be sold for tomorrow/nextdelivery, with a verbal agreement to buy it back the next dayat the same rate.    A VW spokesman said it was company policy not to undertakecurrency hedging but he confirmed that arbitrage was allowed.    He declined to estimate the volume of currency arbitraging.German press reports have put it at 80 billion marks a year.    The spokesman declined to comment on how it would have beenpossible to carry out a fraud involving currency hedging giventhe company's policy not to conduct this kind of business.    VW finance director Rolf Selowsky accepted responsibilityand resigned. VW has suspended six other officials and firedits former foreign exchange chief, Burkhard "Bobby" Junger.    Management board chief Carl Hahn told a ceremony todaymarking VW's 50 millionth vehicle that personnel changes didnot mean any of those involved was guilty. REUTER
1987 U.S. SOYBEAN LOAN SHOULD STAY SAME-AMSTUTZ Congress should give the U.S.Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybeanloan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushelin order to help resolve the problem of soybean exportcompetitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said.    Speaking to reporters following a Senate AgricultureAppropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out ofthe current soybean program "dilemma" would be for Congress toallow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if theloan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to makeU.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates tofurther buydown the loan rate.    Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot beless than 4.77 dlrs per bu.    Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change thefarm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.    The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.    Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision onsoybean program changes will be the budget costs.    He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is thatthe U.S. loan rate provides an "umbrella" to foreign productionand causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.    Asked about the American Soybean Association's request forsome form of income support, Amstutz said "the competitiveproblem is the most severe." He said USDA is still studying thesituation and "no resolution" has yet been found. Reuter
U.S. CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW U.S. corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassedacreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as oneof the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixtyyears, Agriculture Department officials said.    USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures willlikely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.    Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. cornproduction will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987corn production could drop by over one billion bushels toaround seven billion bushels.    Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grainsprogram, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservationprogram, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrainanalysts said.    "There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease incorn acreage," one said. "It's difficult for any farmer to notgo along with the program this year."    Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year butat a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.    Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, theysaid, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.    If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then thedrop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 whenfarmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.    Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. Asevere drought that summer in major producing states causedyields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2billion bushels.    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analystssaid the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billionbushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.    "This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significantreduction in production," an analyst said.    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would notincrease significantly, a specialist said.    High producing corn belt states are expected to show thegreatest acreage reductions, based upon historicalparticipation in government programs, analysts said.    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the mostin marginal producing areas of the southeast and the westerncorn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.    "Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,"he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts inhigher-producing delta areas.    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, hassteadily declined in the 1980's.    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been inthe low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. Thehighest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA haskept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mlnacres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yieldsaveraging 119.3 bushels per acre.    "We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billionbushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so," an analyst said.    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres aslong as government program provisions remain the same, analystssaid.    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required toset aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligiblefor payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15pct of their acreage.    "To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have toprovide more incentives," an analyst said. Reuter

ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER Argentine grain producers againreduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April,trade sources said.    They said growers now forecast soybean production thisseason at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week'sestimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mlntonnes forecast in mid-February.    The new forecast is still higher than last season's recordtotal production.    Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecastfor the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.    Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean podsin the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Feprovinces and northern Buenos Aires.    The crop since January has been hit by high temperaturesand inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more emptypods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86record of 3.34 mln hectares.    The state of the crop continued to be good in general untillast week but intense, heavy rains since could have causeddamage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.    Where the rains were less heavy they were consideredbeneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops insouthern Buenos Aires province but are not expected toinfluence production forecasts.    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, whererainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maizeand sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week byrains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, LaPampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mlnhectares in 1985/86.    The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast atbetween 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 productionand 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of thearea sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Airesalthough at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage isimpossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days ofsunshine dries the fields.    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.    Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln tonnes.    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by therains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and startingin La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes. Reuter
LOWER U.S. SOYBEAN LOAN IDEA SHARPLY CRITICIZED U.S. soybean lobbyists andcongressional aides criticized a proposal from a seniorAgriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S.soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs perbushel next year.    "I don't know who in Congress would propose that happening.Politically it would be totally unacceptable," an aide to asenior farm-state senator said.    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week thatCongress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel ratherthan increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.    "I'm convinced that Congress will not go along with this,"American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.    Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that ifthe soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then considerways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.    His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  theadministration's position is in the debate over what should bedone to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protectsoybean farmers' income.    Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown theloan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have beenpointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean pricescompetitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues tomaintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a movewould be too costly.    "There will be alot of other options that will beconsidered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutzproposal," said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan(R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.    "Anybody representing large groups of soybean producerswould not be very excited about supporting a lower soybeanloan," O'Conner said.    Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan anddecide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlrbasic rate, but that there has to be something mandated toincrease soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen.Thad Cochran (R-Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of asoybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said. Reuter

GRAIN REPORTS IMPROVE U.S. FARM OUTLOOK-ANALYSTS The U.S. grain planting intentions andstocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, agrain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.    The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocksare "the first report we've had for a long time that shows anyoptimism for anybody," said John "Bud" Frazier, grain analystand executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.    "I'm really excited about it," Frazier said.    The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend toplant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted lastyear, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.    The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels ofsoybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushelsof wheat, all below trade guesses.    Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analystwith AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst withShearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Tradepanel to discuss the reports.    Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendlyfor the market, and soybean prices would jump three to fivecents a bushel "if the bell rang right now."    "We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn andsoybeans) than we thought we had," he said, noting that hog andpoultry production is up.    "We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,"said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and15 pct in the preceding quarter.    However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceedconsumption.    She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres camein southeastern states, where yields are usually low.    "We have the potential for record breaking soybean yieldsthis year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow'sopening," she said.    Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and thecrop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down fromlast year's 8.25 billion bushels.    "We'll need very good disappearance next year to reducestocks," she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last yearat 6.7 billion bushels.    Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the longterm, "But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks downto where we could start rebuilding prices."    Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage reportcould prompt farmers to change their plans and plant moresoybeans.    The panelists agreed that the reports should discouragetalk of revising the 1985 farm bill.    "There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm lawwe're working under today, and this report should reinforcethat," Frazier said.    "We are seeing the program beginning to work," said Meyer.

MIDWEST CASH GRAIN - SLOW COUNTRY MOVEMENT Cash grain dealers reported slow countrymovement of corn and soybeans across the Midwest, with evencorn sales from PIK-and-roll activity seen earlier this weekdrying up.    Some dealers said the USDA may further adjust the postedcounty price at the Gulf to take into account high bargefreight rates as a way to keep corn sales flowing, but addedthe current plan probably will be given a few weeks to see ifit will work as hoped.    Corn and soybean basis values continued to drop on theIllinois and MidMississippi River due to the strong bargefreight rates. Toledo and Chicago elevators were finishingloading the first corn boats of the new shipping season,supporting spot basis values at those terminal points.

FRENCH FARMERS PLAN TO CUT MAIZE PLANTINGS French farmers are planning to cut theirmaize sowings by between 100,000 and 150,000 hectares this yearfrom the 1.87 mln ha harvested in 1986, the French MaizeProducers' Association, AGPM, said.    It said its first estimate of planting intentions indicatedcuts of 15 to 20 pct in plantings in the northern region ofPicardy and the Paris Basin, which harvested 192,000 ha lastyear.    In the centre-west region of Poitou-Charentes, plantingswere estimated four to seven pct up on last year's harvested244,000 ha.    Planting intentions in the south-east ranged between ninepct less and two pct more than last year's 125,000 ha. In thesouth-west the AGPM said producers intended to plant a similararea to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided watersupplies are adequate in the Midi-Pyrenees region after thelast two years of drought.    Meanwhile, the oilseed plant breeding association, AMSOL,said sunflower plantings in France this year are indicated atbetween 900,000 and 950,000 ha against 829,000 harvested lastyear, while soya plantings are indicated at 80,000 ha againstlast year's harvested 48,000.

U.S., ARGENTINA SETTLE SOYPRODUCT CASE - YEUTTER U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a case brought by the U.S. soybean crushing industry allegingunfair subsidies to Argentina's crushing industry.    Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here lateyesterday, Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting withArgentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during atrade ministers' meeting in New Zealand last week.    Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers,Argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans andproducts, U.S. and Argentine officials said.    The U.S. case brought by the U.S. National SoybeanProcessors Association alleged Argentina, through differentialexport taxes, implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers.    The U.S. crushing industry, in its complaint under Section301 of trade law, said higher Argentine export taxes onsoybeans than on products encourage the export of products andrepresented an unfair trade practice.    Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the U.S.government supported the U.S. complaint and unless Argentinatook steps to eliminate the taxes, the United States wouldconsider taking further action in the case, U.S. and Argentineofficials said.    An Argentine official here said no timetable was given forremoval of the Argentine export taxes. Reuter
SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER Speculation the United States willoffer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to havereached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary ofState George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheatmarkets since officials from the two countries held theircustomary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow'sdecision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn marketstrengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand inthe way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export EnhancementProgram, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit toMoscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representativeshere as a clear signal that the Reagan administration waspreparing an offer.    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lippedabout the prospects of a subsidy offer.    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned thecontention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,while not a "done deal," is a live possibility.    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whomasked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that anoffer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,are saying they would not rule one out.    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as topredict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten daysto two weeks.    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaderswho had been in contact with administration officials.    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancementoffer would be made by the middle of this month.    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would endup being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier thisyear when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrsper tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheatsubsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases ofU.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat dealwould appear to be price.    Last summer the administration took the controversial stepof offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but wereembarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the groundsthat the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat pricesfar above world market prices.    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level upfront instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be ameans of controlling the price while attempting to dampencriticism, grain trade sources said.    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultzfrom saying the Soviets were "chortling" because Washington wasoffering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available toU.S. housewives.    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representativeshere is that a general warming of relations between the twocountries since last summer, combined with continued hard timesin the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would considerbuying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstancessurrounding the administration's announcement of the wheatsubsidy offer last summer.    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional andindustry leaders were led to believe the White House haddecided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include notonly the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer toinclude only the Soviets.    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure ofuncertainty even to the predictions of those most convincedthat the administration will not now pass up the opportunity tosell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP Fresh, heavy rains caused furtherdamage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the weekto yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, tradesources said.    They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum cropswere damaged and yield estimates affected. New productionforecasts were made for all these crops.    The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registeredmore than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires andworsened the flooding in various parts of the province.    The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aireshave surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.    The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.    In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres areabordering on Uruguay.    In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mmin places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.    The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.    Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also befurther delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.    The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of thecrops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.    Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa andBuenos Aires provinces.    The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has beenlowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lowerthan the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.    The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.    The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of thearea sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Itwill begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weatherpermitting.    Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mlntonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which privateproducers put 1985/86 production.    The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the officialfigure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production.    The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers'targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.    The production forecast was reduced to between three and3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.    The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mlnhectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.    The forecast for soybean yield this season was the leastchanged in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.    These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season'srecord of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources,and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.    The adjustment to the production forecast is due to therains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced thesunlight needed for this crop, sources said.    Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted downfurther.    The humidity could induce rotting and growers are stillfinding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlierin the season.    Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southernCordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Reuter
U.S. FARM REORGANIZATIONS PROVING COSTLY - GAO U.S. farmers who reorganize theiroperations to circumvent a cap on federal payments could add2.3 billion dlrs to the cost of the government's agriculturalprograms by 1989, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said.    "We estimate that should the trend in farm reorganizationscontinue, reorganizations since 1984 could be adding almost 900mln dlrs annually to program costs by 1989," GAO SeniorAssociate Director Brian Crowley said.    "Cumulative costs for the six-year period, 1984 to 1989,could approach 2.3 billion dlrs," he said.    Between 1984 and 1986, reorganizations added almost 9,000new persons to U.S. Agriculture Department payment rolls,Crowley told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat,Soybeans and Feedgrains.

U.S. ACREAGE CUTS SEEN LIMITING STOCK BUILD Sharp cuts this year in U.S. plantedacreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile butwill at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, AgricultureDepartment and industry commodity analysts said.    "The scenario is turning around on stocks. The wholesupply/demand picture could finally be getting more inbalance," a USDA analyst said.    The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicatedthat U.S. farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annualacreage reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mlnacres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program,bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres,almost a third of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base.    Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 willprobably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup instocks, analysts said.    "It's a substantially different story from last year whenwe added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile," VernonMcMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said.    Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here,McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likelytranslate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields,final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels.    McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resultingin a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpileof 5.45 billion bushels.    "To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we'reat least in a holding pattern," George Hoffman, director ofcommodity analysis for Pillsbury said.    Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to "significantly less"domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices.    USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage andsaid wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least notincrease. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, nextyear's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said.    "We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now,so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreagereductions, that would be an improvement," an AgricultureDepartment wheat analyst said.    Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be thesmallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lowerfinal production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to100 mln bushels, analysts said.    As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in theconservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programswill be more effective because they will force more highproducing land out of production, a USDA analyst said.    "We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very longtunnel," the analyst said. Reuter

To be eligible under the new seed credit guarantees, allsales must be registered by September 30, 1987, and shipped byDecember 31, 1987, USDA said. Reuter
JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S. Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market," he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table," the officialsaid. REUTER
MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET Malaysia is unlikely to meet itstargeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.    Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliserand overstressed palms, they said.    The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil Worldnewsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely todrop sharply this year.    Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell morepalm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage theindustry, a leading grower told Reuters.    The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnesagainst about 800,000 last March, the growers said.    The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this yeardue to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.    The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.    In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expectedto enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oiloutput peaks.    They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new treesagainst 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reductionwill not be felt for about another three years.

FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, whichwill be sown between May and August or September, has so farnot been as intense as in previous years. Reuter
BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS Storage problems with Brazil's recordgrain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mlntonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of thisyear's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable inharvesting, but that most of it would stem from storageproblems.    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,theoretically sufficient for the crop.    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badlydistributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande doSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but wereresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-Westgrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storagecapacity.    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya andmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grainsproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared tostoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable forstoring loose grain, Brito said.    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport thecrops.    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crophas been evident from television reports, which have shownenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries. Reuter

INDIA OILSEED OUTPUT FORECAST TO RISE India's oilseed output is expected torise to 12.25 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ending October, up on 11.15mln in 1985/86 but down from 12.95 mln harvested in 1984/85,the Agriculture Ministry's 1986/87 report said.    But the forecast for 1986/87 is well below a target of 14.8mln tonnes fixed for the year, it said, adding bad weather hitgroundnut and other oilseed crops.    The National Oilseeds Development Program will invest 300mln rupees in 1986/87 on supplying improved high-yielding seedsand other support services to help boost production, it added.India imports about 1.2 mln tonnes of edible oils a year.

BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT Based on field travel in theBrazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be aboutaverage or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.    It said generally favorable weather from early Decemberthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness.    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 daysfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the secondweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeanswhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, thereport said.    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will createserious storage problems, the report said.    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased bymore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields areexpected to be above average, it said.    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn cropcrop has been harvested.    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grainelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, thereport said.    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Paranaaccounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasonsfor the decline are expected reduced government support priceand good summer crop harvests. Reuter

In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, thedepartment said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largestbuyers.    Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.    Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season andnet reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season werefour-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and thefour-week average, it said.    Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination withpurchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.    Other significant purchasers for the current year wereMexico and Honduras, it said.    Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below theprior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.    Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the majorpurchasers, the department said.    Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-weekaverage. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, theNetherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset byreductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.    Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, theDepartment said.    Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's levelbut nine pct below the four-week average.    Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followedby Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.    Sorghum sales of 143,300 tonnes were 25 pct less than theprior week, with Japan and Venezuela the main buyers.  Reuter
GRAIN SHIPMENTS TO THE USSR -- USDA There were 287,700 tonnes of U.S.corn shipped to the Soviet Union in the week ended April 2,according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's latest ExportSales report.    That compares with 106,200 tonnes shipped in the priorweek.    There were no wheat or soybean shipments during the week.    The USSR has purchased 2,825,600 tonnes of U.S. corn, as ofApril 2, for delivery in the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR grainagreement.    Total shipments in the third year of the U.S.-USSR grainsagreement, which ended September 30, amounted to 152,600 tonnesof wheat, 6,808,100 tonnes of corn and 1,518,700 tonnes ofsoybeans. Reuter
CHINA RAISES GRAIN PURCHASE PRICES China has raised the state purchaseprices of corn, rice, cottonseed and shelled peanuts from April1 to encourage farmers to grow them, the official ChinaCommercial Daily said.    The paper said the price paid for corn from 14 northernprovinces, cities and regions has increased by one yuan per 50kg. A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take theprice to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.    The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10southern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.    The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwestChina has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave nomore price details.    It said local authorities must inform farmers of the priceincreases before farmers begin planting, to encourageproduction of grains and oilseeds.    Chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to growgrain because they can earn more from other crops. REUTER

SPANISH SUNOIL EXPORTERS SEEK SEED CLEARANCE Spanish exporters are asking thegovernment to clear 33,200 tonnes of sunflower seed authorisedfor export by the European Community (EC), a spokesman for oneof Spain's major sunflower oil producers said.    He told Reuters in a telephone interview the government washolding back on authorisation to hold prices low.    "They are deliberately keeping prices down to help meet thisyear's inflation target despite the threat of a surplus on whatlooks like a bigger harvest than we expected," he said.    He said the policy of allowing stocks to accumulate hadcaused a price drop, with raw oil prices falling to 147 pesetasa kilo from 160 at the start of the 1986/87 marketing yearending July 31.    Sunflower oil output was expected to rise to 370,000 tonnesthis year from 340,000 last year, with seed output up at905,000 tonnes from 860,000 last year.    He said domestic consumption was falling due to imports ofother edible oils. "We estimate demand at 296,000 tonnes thisyear, leaving a 124,000 tonne surplus with the 50,000 tonnesnow stockpiled," he said. "If we discount 24,000 tonnes held forstrategic purposes, this still leaves us with 100,000 tonnes." Reuter

SEOUL UNVEILS SHOPPING LIST OF U.S. GOODS South Korea unveiled a shopping list of2.6 billion dlrs of U.S. Goods in line with its new policy ofseeking to limiting its trade surplus to ease trade frictionwith Washington.    The government said this would help freeze this year'strade surplus with the United States at the 1986 level.    "The surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dollars last yearfrom 4.3 billion in 1985, was projected to top 10 billion thisyear but the government has taken steps to constrain it to theseven billion dollar level," one Trade Ministry official toldReuters.    A government statement said the 2.6 billion dlrs was inaddition to about two billion dlrs of purchases made last monthby a South Korean trade mission to the United States.    The announcement follows a visit here this week by U.S.Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who said that if SouthKorea wanted to avoid protectionist retaliation it should notfalter in its policies to open its market and cut its surplus.    The statement said the government, state agencies and otherpublic institutions would buy 480 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Cars,computers, helicopters, ambulances, motorcycles, medical andlaboratory equipment and other products. "This amounts includes89 mln dlrs worth of purchases which were not originallyreflected in their budgets," it added.    The list includes 1.13 billion dlrs of capital goods, 700mln of farm products, 50 mln of aluminium, zinc, polyethyleneand other raw materials, and 250 mln of steel, electronics andshipbuilding parts which would be shifted from other nations.    Agriculture Ministry officials said South Korea had alreadybought 310 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Wheat, raw cotton, corn andsoybeans.    This meant the country would buy from the United Statesnearly all of the 1.27 billion dlrs of its planned imports ofsuch commodities this year, they said.    The government will also take steps to reduce tariffs,accelerate the opening of its markets, voluntarily restrainexports and cut export financing, the statement said.    South Korea will also reorganise the country's 3,600 tradeagents to deliver better after-sales services for importedproducts and hold a trade show in November for U.S. Products. Reuter
SOY PLANTS MIGHT BE USED TO DRAW CADMIUM FROM SOIL Effective extraction of the toxicmetal cadmium from soil may at last be feasible using soybeanplants, research in the Netherlands by a Belgian-basedenvironment group shows.    Cadmium, naturally drawn up by plants and passed on toconsumers, has been shown to produce kidney damage andresulting calcium loss as well as causing high blood pressureand cancers, a spokesman for the Ecological Life andCultivation (VELT) said.    Three years of experiments by the organization showedsoybean plants extracted up to 16 pct of soil-borne cadmium,which went into the leaves and not into the beans themselves.    Cadmium is present in the soil because of emissions in thepast by factories producing non-ferrous metals, the spokesmansaid.    "Although many of these factories are now using far safermethods of manufacture, the cadmium is already in the soil anduntil now there has been no way to get rid of it," he said. Reuter
EC OFFICIALS PLAN NEW EFFORT ON FARM PRICE TALKS European Community (EC) leaders hopeto make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks onreforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when ECagriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions herethis morning.    Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessenmet Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night toplan a new initiative.    Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker, who currently chairs ECfarm ministers' meetings, were said to be disappointed by thelack of progress in the talks so far this week.    The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a toughpackage involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct infarmers' returns for many crops this year.    Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 butare only this week getting down to serious negotiations.    Yesterday, they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by2.5 pct, and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to ECstores, to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by largermargins, and to impose a tax on EC-produced and importedoilseeds, a proposal which would be likely to sour EC traderelations with the United States.    Diplomatic sources said ministers, all of whom are opposedto at least one of these propositions, maintained entrenchedpositions yesterday, making the task of de Keersmaeker insteering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one.    They said he could also be treading a minefield if hesought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers overplans to change the system by which EC farm prices, expressedin a notional common currency, are translated into thecurrencies of member states.    West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday hewould veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area,saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currencynations.    The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present apaper to his colleagues which, while not having the status of acompromise proposal, would attempt to narrow their options.    But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministerslike Kiechle, with his commitment to maintaining traditionalrural patterns, and others who see runaway farm spending asunacceptable economically, is likely to prove extremelydifficult to bridge.    They agreed with EC farmers' union association presidentHans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in Juneappeared to be the best that could be hoped for. Reuter
EC FARM MINISTERS END PRICES MEETING STILL DIVIDED European Community (EC) agricultureministers ended a three-day meeting in Luxembourg still deeplydivided over plans by the EC Commission to curb the cost of theEC's farm policy through sharp cuts in farm returns.    Their chairman, Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker, told a newsconference after the meeting he would work on a paper settingout possible compromise solutions in the next two weeks, withthe hope that the ministers can get down to detailednegotiations at a meeting in Brussels on May 18.    But diplomats said the talks this week had served littlemore than to clarify member states' positions on the complexpackage of measures proposed by the commission.    The executive body has proposed measures which would resultin price cuts this year for many crops of upwards of 10 pct.    Other controversial plans include a tax on EC-produced andimported oilseeds and fats to bring in two billion Europeancurrency units, to help the EC's cash crisis, and changes inthe conversion of EC common farm prices into nationalcurrencies which would inflict extra burdens on West German andDutch farmers.    De Keersmaeker attempted yesterday to narrow differencesbetween EC states on the oils tax proposal, the currencymeasures and the key question of cereals prices and associatedmeasures.    But he told journalists, "We have used this meeting to reachthe point at which real negotiations can start at the nextmeeting. Ideally they should have started now but ourprocedures took much longer than planned."    Ministers are in theory supposed to agree a price packageby April 1 each year, although this target is seldom reached inpractice.    Diplomats said on all the points there were widelydiverging views, with Britain and the Netherlands, thecountries most supportive of commission proposals for cerealsprice cuts, strongly opposed to the oils tax.    However, de Keersmaeker said West German objections to themonetary proposals could prove the most difficult issue toresolve. "This is a very tough political nut, and because of thevery nature of the problem there is no technical solution," hesaid. Commission sources said farm commissioner FransAndriessen was prepared to alter some technical aspects of hisproposals to make an agreement easier.    However, because of the EC's budgetary crisis, he hadlittle room for concessions to pleas for a cut in the impact ofhis proposals on farmers' incomes as several ministers, led byGermany's Ignaz Kiechle, are demanding.    EC Commission president Jacques Delors has warned that theEC will have an accumulated budgetary deficit of over fivebillion Ecus by the end of this year, even if the commissionfarm price package is adopted in its entirety.

SOYCOMPLEX COULD RALLY ON TIGHT U.S. FEED SUPPLY Nearby months in soybean and soymealfutures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply oflivestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep thenew crop outlook bearish, traders said.    "A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worriedabout where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,"one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.    Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers forthe few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with aDecatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bidanother two cents today to 10 over July futures.    Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willingto sell, dealers said.    Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the beliefthat even if futures rally back to last month's highs, countrymovement may remain light because farmers in many areas aresold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern halfof the Midwest.    Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtimefor maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducingthe weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping thespot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.    Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help Julysoybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal hasalready moved to a premium over the August through Octobermonths and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may alsomove to a July premium later this month, they added. Reuter
RAINS AID MANITOBA CROPS DURING WEEK Widespread, soaking rains aided cropdevelopment across the province, with the northwest cropproducing region receiving the most precipitation, according tothe Manitoba Agriculture weekly crop report.    The rains replenished formerly low soil moisture reserves,with reserves in all areas now rated good, the report said.

NO YIELD DAMAGE YET IN U.S. CORN, BEANS - USDA The U.S. corn and soybean crops arein mostly good condition and have not suffered any yielddeterioration from recent hot, dry weather, AgricultureDepartment and private weather and crop analysts said.    "I don't see any reduction in yield potential yet," NortonStrommen, chief meteorologist at USDA told Reuters. "The (cornand soybean) crop is actually in mostly good condition and isprogressing ahead of normal, which is good," he said.    Abnormally hot, dry weather in midwestern crop areassparked a sharp rally in Chicago futures today, causing newcrop soybeans to advance the 30 cent daily limit to 6.14 dlrsper bushel and September corn to go up 12 cents to 2.81 dlrs.    "This rally is amazing," a private crop analyst said. "Corn,soybeans and wheat are in excellent condition."    The USDA meteorologist said the only effects of the warm,dy weather on crops so far has probably been to speed updevelopment of the crop, which will help the crop better copewith stress later in its more critical growing period.    "What this weather will do is simply push the crop towardsrapid development of a good, deep root system to draw on thesubsoil reserve. It actually strengthens the crop to go througha little stress early on," Strommen said.    Strommen noted that subsoil moisture is in good shape inmost growing areas.    Strommen and other private crop analysts noted corn andsoybeans will not enter their critical growth stages until Julyand August.    But because of its early development this year, Strommensaid the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproductionperiod by the first of July.    "Weatherwise, if the market is truly concerned about corn orsoybeans, it should be more concerned about corn. But thedryness still has to last for another two to three weeks," ananalyst said.    Soybeans, on the other hand, can withstand several moreweeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating, cropanalysts agreed.    August and September are the critical yield-producingmonths for soybeans, Strommen said.    "The sole purpose of the soybean plant is to simply surviveduring May, June and July until the August rains whichdetermine the crop," a crop analyst said.    Some analysts contend, however, that in certain growingareas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensurethat there will not be problems later.    Strommen noted the USDA's current six to 10 day weatherforecast calls for above normal temperatures and below normalprecipitation in much of the corn belt.    "This opens up all sorts of speculation," he said. Reuter
HOT WEATHER PUSHES CBT GRAINS TO NEW HIGHS Hot, dry weather over the Midwest, withmore forecast, pushed grain futures prices to new highs todayon the Chicago Board of Trade.    Soybean futures led the advance, closing up the30-cent-per-bushel daily trading limit in contracts fordelivery after this year's fall harvest. All months setlife-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs abushel.    "The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter thannormal for some time out," said David Bartholomew, assistantvice president for Merrill Lynch. "We have probably gone ashigh as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how tomeasure the euphoria level."    Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week,posted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limitin new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs.    Corn futures set contract highs in March through September,with December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4dlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improvedharvest conditions in the southern Midwest.    The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybeanplants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefityoung plants by encouraging the development of deep rootsystems, Bartholomew said.    European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed toactive buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybeanorders went unfilled at the close, traders said.    After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)meteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have notsuffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather.    Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of thedollar, which can depress prices by making grains moreexpensive for foreign buyers.    But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York'sCOMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settlesteady.    Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that theweather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears ofinflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures,which closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S.trade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices.    A USDA report released after trading said the number ofcattle being fed in seven major producing states was abovelevels expected by traders. Traders said the report wouldprobably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the ChicagoMercantile Exchange.    USDA put cattle-on-feed in the seven major states at 7.52mln head, 106 pct of a year ago and at the high end of tradeforecasts.    A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May,up 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said.    Cattle futures closed mixed in choppy trading today as hotweather slowed consumer demand for red meat, traders said. Reuter

TAIWAN, URUGUAY IN PRICE DISPUTE OVER SOYBEANS Uruguayan suppliers have agreed to supplyTaiwan with only 25,000 tonnes of soybeans out of a total70,000 tonnes agreed in April, a spokesman for the jointcommittee of Taiwan's soybean importers told Reuters.    He said a rise in world prices had made the Uruguayansreluctant to ship any soybeans at the agreed price of 226.56U.S. Dlrs per tonne.    The Uruguayans agreed to supply part of the shipment afterthe Taiwan committee threatened last week to cancel the order,but they postponed delivery to July 1-20 from the original June5-25, the committee spokesman said.    Government sources in Montevideo confirmed that Uruguayangrain exporting firms would ask Taiwan to reconsider prices onthe soybeans but said the government would not intervene in thedispute.    "The deal was agreed to between two private companies,without any participation whatsoever from the Uruguayangovernment," Uruguyan Agriculture Ministry spokesman AndresBonino said.    He added, "Uruguay is not going to export 70,000 tonnes ofsoybeans, since total production this year has been lower thanthat figure."    The contract called for the Uruguayans to deliver the70,000 tonnes in two shipments between June 5 and August 10.    Taiwan's ambassador in Montevideo, Henry Wang, toldreporters, "Both countries are finishing details to arrive at asatisfactory price."    He said the price would be "very advantageous (for Uruguay)because it will be above the international price."    Taiwan bought some 36,000 tonnes of soybean last year,making it Uruguay's biggest customer for the oilseed.    Taiwan's joint committee holds a tender today for twoshipments of U.S. Soybeans totalling 87,000 tonnes. REUTER
JAPAN BUYS 50,000 TONNES OF CANADIAN RAPESEED Japanese crushers have so far bought50,000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed for shipment in lateJuly/August and total purchases for the period are likely to bearound 130,000 tonnes, trade sources said.    Crushers reduced their Canadian purchases for late June andJuly to 111,000 from 120,000 tonnes due to seasonal maintenancework at oil mills.    But estimated crushers' buying for July/August was slightlyabove monthly average and is likely to keep to this level for awhile due to a better crushing margin compared with that ofsoybeans, they said.

JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pctto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pctfrom 2.1 pct. REUTER

RAINS HELP U.S. WESTERN CORN BELT, MORE SEEN Weekend rain over the Western Corn Beltbrought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlierthis month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcomemoisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-WeatherInc.    "There is going to be more rain for the next two, threedays," he said. "We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal toabove normal moisture this week."    Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southernMinnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in easternNebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.    Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend butwere receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.    Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio withthudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.    "Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, apretty good rain," Mohler said.    Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparkingan early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board ofTrade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.    Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt isexpected to move over the central Midwest, then move northlater in the week. That could bring new rain patterns acrossthe Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions asearly-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stagein early July, he said. Reuter

OILMEAL DEMAND STILL STRONG IN U.S., SOVIET UNION Oilmeal demand remained strong in theUnited States in July and August and six pct up on levels seenin the same months last year, with most of the rise coming insoymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose toa record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pcton the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal atseven pct, it said.    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago monthsfollowing a huge increase in soymeal imports.    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediatelybut went into stocks. With imports again large in September, itestimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes byOctober 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a yearearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due tobumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposalswere reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mlnat that time last year.

ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT The American Soybean Association (ASA)denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegalunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, andthreatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does notremedy the situation.    ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsoredOutlook 87 conference: "It will be filed unless the EC takesdrastic and immediate steps."    "These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,since they were established after the zero soybean duty wasestablished in 1962," he said.    The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would askfor an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies tomake the regime non-discriminatory.    The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, inan effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds productionhas risen dramatically since then.    The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above worldmarket levels and is considering implementing a controversialoils and fats tax.    The subsidies "are obvious attempts to circumvent the zeroduty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell," Adamssaid.    The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support itstrade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes anEC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in theEC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.    U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct involume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result ofEC policies, Adams added.    Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker atthe conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products. Reuter

US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT A proposal to require importedtropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrowand possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopesthe plan would be adopted this year.    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as anamendment to a farm spending reduction package.    "I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as givingAmerican consumers the information they need," he said.    Proponents of the measure, including the American SoybeanAssociation, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oilsare high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicatingtropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourageconsumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,Indonesia and the Philippines.    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal"blatantly discriminates" against imports, would be impossible todefend under international trade law and would harm relationswith the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of theirsaturated fats from meat and dairy products and relativelylittle from tropical oils.    The committee voted largely along party lines, with threeDemocrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure. Reuter
U.S. DRAFTS SANCTIONS IN ARGENTINA SOY CASE The U.S. is drafting options includingpossible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute overthe differential between soybean and product  taxes whichBuenos Aires levies on exports.    The drafting of retaliation options follows the failureof high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filedby the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differentialexport taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports incompetition with the U.S.    "Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict(Argentine) access to our market," said one U.S. source.       The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year afterTrade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed toend the differential.    But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.    Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agricultureminister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroilleon September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could notnarrow the differential further for 1987/88.    As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is consideringrestrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beefand finished leather, the U.S. sources said.    A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reaganadministration soon, they said. Reuter
