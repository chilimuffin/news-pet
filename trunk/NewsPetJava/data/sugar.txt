INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW Indonesia"s agriculture sector will growby just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pctin 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates ordeclines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.    Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast tofall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report onIndonesia"s agricultural performance.    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in1987.    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mlntonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because ofa drawdown on stocks.    "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not lookpromising as rice production is forecast to decline and theproduction of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or nogain," the report says.    "The modest overall increase which is expected will be dueto significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oiland palm kernels."    Constraints to significant overall increases inagricultural output include a shortage of disease resistantseeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance byfarmers to shift from rice production to other crops, thereport underlines.    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak ofpests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 whichlargely offset gains in yields.    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are nowresistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, moreresistant rice types.    The government is depending on increased production ofexport commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood andpalm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crudeoil prices.    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pctin 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports risingto an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, thereport says.    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) willrise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports willalso rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybeanmeal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of lastSeptember"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a risein domestic demand.    The report said that Indonesia"s overall economicperformance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slightnegative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pctin 1984.    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsiblefor the slump. REUTER
INDONESIAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN SHORT OF TARGET Indonesia's raw sugar output is likelyto be 1.8 mln tonnes in calendar 1987, unchanged from 1986 andbelow the government's 1987 forecast of 2.5 mln, the U.S.Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987.    Indonesia bought 162,500 tonnes of raw sugar on worldmarkets in late 1986, the report said.    The embassy estimated Indonesia's calendar 1986 raw sugarproduction at 1.8 mln tonnes, against a government estimate of1.99 mln.    It said that Indonesia's move into sugar self-sufficiencyin 1984 may have been short-lived.    The report said, "The government continues to promotesugarcane production through its smallholder intensificationprogram and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcaneproducers.    "However, there are considerable indications that farmersare reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is notas good as that of other crops." REUTER
INDIAN SUGAR OUTPUT RISES IN FIRST FOUR MONTHS India's sugar output to January 31 inthe 1986/87 season (October/September) rose to 3.66 mln tonnesfrom 3.46 mln in the same 1985/86 period, the Indian SugarMills Association said.    Total offtake in the first four months of the current yearwas 2.71 mln tonnes (including 241,000 tonnes imported) fordomestic use and 4,000 tonnes for export, against 2.81 mlntonnes (including 993,000 imported) for domestic use and 3,000tonnes for export in the corresponding period of 1985/86.    Factory stocks at end-January were 3.05 mln tonnes (96,000imported) against 3.13 mln (96,000 imported) a year earlier. REUTER

CUBA TELLS TRADERS SUGAR EXPORTS MAY BE DELAYED Cuba has told international sugaroperators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March thatthese contracts will take second place to Cuba's directshipments to its export markets, dealers here said.    Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said thelanguage of the message was not totally clear and some believedshipments would be honoured if the traders declare the SovietUnion as the destination of their contracts.    The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the lastweek and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's exportavailability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said.    Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediatelyavailable raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets wasprobably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tenderlast month.    Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forwarddelivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in thesale of several cargoes.    Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receiveMarch shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to exportmarkets, traders said. Reuter

CUBAN CATTLE THREATENED BY DROUGHT Over 750,000 head of cattle are sufferingthe effects of a severe shortage of feed as a result of aprolonged drought in the normally rich sugar and cattleproducing province of Camaguey, the newspaper Granma reported.    The province produces 23 pct of Cuba's beef and is theisland's number two province in milk production. Granma said20,000 head of cattle are now in imminent danger.    The newspaper said a "cattle emergency" had been decreed andthe cattle are being rounded up.    Some 110,000 head have been transferred to the sugar caneconditioning centers where newly harvested cane is cleanedbefore being sent to the mills.

BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS Brazil's recent announcement of asuspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreigndebt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed viewsamong many international economists and commodities analyststhat Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.    The developing world's most indebted nation is also itsmost prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such ascoffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchangerevenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.    "That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is noway they can trade their way out of this situation," AldoRoldan, Vice President for International Services at ChaseEconometrics, said.    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle theproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on gluttedworld markets, but also had to work to make its position onforeign exchange markets more profitable.    "Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) andexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchangerates," Roldan said.    The Chase economist also said commodities markets weredepressed and generally did not appear very promising for acountry like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23billion dlrs.    But he added: "They are always pretty aggressive and theyhave good foreign marketing channels."    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will becoffee, and even without background pressure from foreigncreditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit themarket this year with a vengeance.    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke upearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusingeach other of intransigence.    "Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,which others wanted changed," one senior coffee dealer said.    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted topreserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he saidBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and otherswould suffer.    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario butas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, thedealer said.    "If they do come into the market at this level it will golower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,"he said.    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 centslower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distantdeliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Daustertold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil hasno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown ofthe ICO talks on export quotas.    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be thefocus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. "Theywill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,"according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc.    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plusdifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of theBrazil soybean crop. "Brazilian farmers also need cash flow andthey can't afford to store the crops," he said.    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some timeabout large South American crops developing under near idealconditions towards record yields.    "We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier thanusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports," Loewy said.    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American SoybeanAssociation (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvestcould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when pricesare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to thevulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of areduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered tofarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about thesoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for pricesby keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers canforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay theloan.    "We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) arestarting to harvest and starting to export," Eshleman said. Buthe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.    Jose Melicias from the research department of DrexelBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as muchas it can this year because of its economic situation.    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. "TheBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay forstorage," he added.    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazilwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias saidit would not make a big difference.    On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may bemuted no matter its need to generate capital.    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, whichcould limit exports to the world market, analysts said. Thecountry may have oversold and be unable to honor exportcommitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused byconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, willgive it little room to stretch exports, they said.    Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year ofsurplus. "Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year itfell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa andfind many more markets for it," one analyst said.    "If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market wouldcollapse and they can't afford to do that," she added. Reuter

MGE PLANNING APRIL 6 START UP OF HFCS CONTRACT The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE)will start trading futures contracts in high fructose cornsyrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.    Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchangeexpects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It hasbeen under review since the exchange submitted the proposal inDecember, 1985.    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tanktruck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wetmilling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is mostcommonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and otherbeverages.    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from productionfacilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designatedby the symbol "HF," would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Monthstraded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months ofMarch, May, July, September and December.    Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with aminimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuationof one dlr per CWT.    "We hope the producers and users of fructose will beactively involved, those producers being the large processors,the corn wet millers, and the users being the beveragebottlers," Henderson said. "But there are potentials for alltypes of people to use it. There is quite a list of industriesthat utilize fructose." Reuter

EC COMMISSION DECLINES COMMENT ON SUGAR OFFER The European Community (EC) Commissiondeclined to give an official reaction to reports that a groupof european operators plan to offer one mln tonnes of sugarinto intervention in protest at Commission export policies.    However, a spokesman for the Commission confirmed theoffers had been made to intervention agencies in various memberstates, and said it would now take up to three weeks for theagencies concerned to complete all necessary documentation.    The spokesman said that under current regulations, the ECwould have to accept all the offers if there were no technicalproblems.    The spokesman said the Commission would only have toreimburse the member state for the cost of buying-in the sugarafter the product was sold out of intervention stores at alater date.    He said that at present there was virtually no sugar heldin intervention stores.    Last year, 45,000 tonnes were sold into intervention andduring the 1984-85 campaign 108,000 tonnes. REUTER
TRADE SAYS EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO FORECAST Traders here and in Paris said theresults of today's EC white sugar tender are hard to forecastbecause of plans by a group of French, West German, Dutch andBelgian operators to sell one mln tonnes of sugar intointervention.    London traders said bids for licences have been reportedbetween 43.00 and 44.00 Ecus per 100 kilos and if any licencesare granted they are likely to be towards the lower end of thatrange, possibly 43.30/43.50 Ecus.    Traders in Paris said they expect maximum rebates ofbetween 43 and 43.50 Ecus.    Other than the Commission releasing no sugar for export,the likely tonnage is expected to be very small, the Londontraders said, while the French sources declined to estimatevolume in view of the psychological impact of the planned salesinto intervention in protest against EC export policies.    Last week licences for 60,500 tonnes were awarded at amaximum rebate of 43.147 Ecus. REUTER

AGENCY TO REVIEW JOHNSON AND JOHNSON SWEETENER Johnson and Johnson said the U.S.Food and Drug Administration has notified the company its foodadditive petition for a high-intensity sweetener has beenformally accepted and now will be reviewed by the agency.    The company said the product, with the generic name ofsucralose, is made from sugar and tastes like sugar, but isabout 600 times sweeter.    It yields no calories and does not promote tooth decay.    Johnson and Johnson said the sweetner is being jointlydeveloped with Tate and Lyle PLC <TATL>.    Tate and Lyle is seeking approval in Canada, the UnitedKingdom and other European countries, Johnson and Johnson said.The company noted its petition covering the product and itssafety evaluation were submitted to the FDA last month.    While awaiting FDA approval, the company said, it isproceeding with plans for commercialization through its McNeilSpecialty Products Co subsidiary.    Johnson and Johnson said it is operating under a licensingagreement with Tate and Lyle, whose collaborative research withscientists at Queen Elizabeth College in London led to thediscovery of Sucralose in 1976.    Patents and licensing agreements control the use ofsucralose through the year 2001, Johnson and Johnson said.    Sucralose is a chlorinated derivative of ordinary sugar.The carbon-chloride bonds in sucralose are stable and are notbroken during digestion or metabolism.    Sucralose is essentially not metabollized by the body. Thechlorine content enhances sweetness without providing calories. Reuter

THAI SUGAR PRODUCTION INCREASES Thai sugar production totalled 960,788tonnes in January, an increase of 12.7 pct on January 1986,according to figures received by the International SugarOrganization.    November and December production figures also exceeded lastyear's totals with the result that output in the first threemonths of the season showed a 23.1 pct increase over 1985/86.Production in the November 1986 to January 1987 period totalled1.29 mln tonnes.    Thai exports in December and January were down, however.January exports fell from 73,164 to 35,910 tonnes.

LICHT SEES STAGNANT EUROPEAN BEET AREA The overall area devoted to sugarbeet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West Germanstatistician F.O. Licht said.    It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar priceswould have a marked effect on planting intentions this year,Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect wasprobably minimal.    The total beet area in the European Community is forecastto fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986.    The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha,against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln.    Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares(with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114(118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44),Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138),Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52),Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136).    Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows, USSR 3400(3440), Albania 10 (9), Bulgaria 52 (50), Czechoslovakia 195(196), East Germany 210 (205), Hungary 108 (96), Poland 460(440), Romania 295 (280).    On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said thesearea forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mlntonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly highlast season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increasesthe chances of a significant reduction in production in1987/88.    Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production couldfall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mlnin 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9mln tonnes against 18.1 mln.

HUNGARIAN 1987 SUGAR BEET AREA LITTLE CHANGED Hungary is to grow sugar beet on105,000 hectares of land this year compared with some 95,000 in1986, the official MTI news agency said.    Diplomats said this reflected Hungary's policy of keepingthe sugar beet area stable under the current five-year plan(1985-89) and producing enough to cover only domestic demanddespite the recent rise of world prices to 10 month highs.    Drought cut the 1986 harvest to 3.58 mln tonnes from 4.07mln in 1985. But a record yield of 130 kilos per tonne of beetkept production at 454,000 tonnes, with 30,000 extra refined inYugoslavia from Hungarian beet. Output was 483,000 in 1985. REUTER
CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS China has to decide if it will increasesugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output andrising demand, in view of market predictions that internationalsugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and theofficial press said.    He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry andFisheries, said this week that China has adjusted thepurchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop inproduction last year but he gave no price details.    One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidlybecause of improving living standards and rising demand forsweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods.    "It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in astate-controlled economy. China may have to import," he said.    Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes inJanuary 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986.    The official Economic Information newspaper last month saidproduction in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April)will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand.    The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes.    "In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beethas fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has droppedand cannot meet demand that is rising every day," it said.    "The country will have to continue imports of sugar and drawdown stocks to meet market demand," it added.    It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming thedrop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for caneand beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmersrefusing to grow them.    The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to threetimes more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up toseven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He couldsell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane.    Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices havenot changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said.    In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuanin 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added.    The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losingmoney. China has 521 sugar mills.    A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in caneacreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct inGuangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct ofChina's sugar in calendar 1985.    He said both provinces are more developed than othersugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities.    But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87,because cane-growing is more economic there, he said.    He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986.    A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mlnat end-January. "Now they are falling but (they) have notreached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,"he said.    "China has options not easily available in westerncountries. It controls stocks strictly and can release lessinto the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly," he said.    The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will beslightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world pricesand serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, arelikely to continue until at least end-1988.    He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-ownedmills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers.    "Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many ofthem using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s," he said.    He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annualfour pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct. REUTER
CUBA SUGAR CROP SEEN AT LEAST SAME AS LAST YEAR Cuban sugar export figures for Januarysuggest that this year's crop may be at least as large as lastyear's 7.35 mln tonnes, according to sugar analysts.    Exports in January totalled 733,000 tonnes raw value, upfrom 725,000 a year earlier, according to figures received bythe International Sugar Organization.    January is the first major export month and the figuresthus give a good indication of the current crop, they said.Fourth quarter exports fell to 622,000 tonnes from 909,000tonnes a year earlier, but this was because Cuba was destockingat the end of 1985, they added.    Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production thisyear at 7.50 mln tonnes.    Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mlntonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes.    There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba, buta hurricane meant that last year's crop was extended.    Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at362,000 tonnes from 489,000 in January 1986, but other Comeconcountries received 210,000 tonnes, against 80,000 tonnes in thesame month last year, figures received by the ISO show.    Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania all tooksubstantially more Cuban sugar.    Cuba's November 1986 exports totalled 158,000 tonnes,compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985, and December's total was237,000 tonnes, down from 518,000 tonnes the year before.Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 6.69 mlntonnes against 7.21 mln in 1985 -- the lowest level since1980's 6.19 mln tonnes, the figures show.

He said the production fall was due to typhoon damageto more than 6,000 hectares of canefields last year. REUTER
EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED European sugar beet plantings areexpected to show little change from last year, despite recentfirmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said.    A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while,so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lowerareas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations.    Trade analysts said their private reports give similarresults and do not differ significantly from the first estimateof stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by WestGerman sugar statistician F. O. Licht.    Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agriculturalexperts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improvedseed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this.In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a lateboost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointingstarts to growing seasons.    Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producerswill grow so-called "C" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the worldmarket. This is what is produced in excess of the basic areaneeded to meet the EC "A" and "B" quotas, which receive full andpartial price support, respectively.    Some analysts said the open row that broke out last weekbetween producers and the EC commission over its export policycould have serious implications for future sugar output.    Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearlyone mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks asthey feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate forthe gap between high EC internal and low world market prices.    However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point,this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resistinghigher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a futurecut in the basic "A" and "B" quotas, they added.    In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quotasugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said firstplanting intentions indicate an area about the same as lastyear's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year.    "The basic trend is towards stability," a FIRS spokesmansaid. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, whitesugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are notencouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar outputlast year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlandsbut below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11.    In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans,since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industrysources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is stillvalid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmedby just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average.    Licht last week estimated West German plantings at areduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year.    British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signedup U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This shouldyield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's cropequalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes.    British Sugar has "A" and "B" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnesof whites and its "C" output is due to improved yields from moreconsistent disease-resistant seed types.    Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, WincentyNowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated SugarIndustry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polishproduction costs and there is no way to convince farmers toincrease the area above the already signed contracted level.    The national plan, set before prices began to rise, putplantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes.    World prices have less impact in Italy than in France orGermany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared tothe domestic market, an official at the national beet growers'association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete butsurveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especiallyin the north where some farmers have switched to soya.    Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higherthan expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar.    Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from arecord 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comesinto force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largestDutch sugar processor, said.    The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnesof white sugar and to cut output of "C" sugar. Last year, theNetherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugaragainst a combined "A" and "B" quota of only 872,000 tonnes.    "The world price of sugar would have to rise much higherthan it has done recently to make planned production of "C" sugarreally worthwhile," the spokesman said.    Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet plantingintentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year'sSoviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year.    Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, butdiplomats said policy is to balance supply with domesticdemand.    The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings areestimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year.    A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De DanskeSukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchangedfrom 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha.    In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domesticdemand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 haagainst 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugarcompany Svenska Sockerfabriks AB.    Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due tolate sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, downfrom 37,600 in 1986.

INDONESIAN SUGAR OUTPUT FORECAST TO RISE IN 1987 Indonesian sugar output is forecast bythe government to reach 2.126 mln tonnes in calendar 1987against projected consumption of 2.039 mln tonnes, AgricultureMinister Achmad Affandi said.    Production in 1986, when Indonesia was forced to importsugar, is officially estimated at 2.016 mln tonnes against1.728 mln in 1985.    The U.S. Embassy said in its annual Agriculture Report onIndonesia there were growing signs that actual output was lowerthan official figures.

Out of this, traders in France received 18,000 tonnes, inDenmark 15,000, in West Germany 12,250, in the Netherlands12,000 and in Belgium 3,250 tonnes, it added.    Earlier today, London traders had expected the subsidy forthe current season whites campaign for licences to end-Aug tobe between 44.10 and 44.50 Ecus per 100 kilos.    Traders had also forecast today's total authorised sugartonnage export awards to be between 60,000 and 70,000 tonnesversus 71,000 last week when the restitution was 43.248 Ecus.    Cumulative export authorisations for the current 1986/87season now stand at 1,915,270 tonnes (40 weeks). REUTER
SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT Latin American sugar producersare awaiting further rises in world market prices before movingto boost production, official and trade sources said.    Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S.Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below theregion's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.    The recent rise in prices has placed producers on thealert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of LatinAmerican and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA),told Reuters.    However, Rico said, it would require another five to sevencents to stimulate notable increases in output.    "Producers are taking measures for increasing theirproduction when the prices are profitable," he said.    Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continuedrise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leadersin Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.    "The prices are ridiculous," said Julian Mateo, vicepresident of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-AgriculturalLeague. "At current prices nobody is going to considerincreasing production."    Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasingoutput, given the instability of world markets.    An official at Colombia's National Association of SugarCane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets."The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yetgiving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modifyanything."    In 1985, the latest year for which full figures areavailable, Central and South American nations produced 28 mlntonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. Ayear earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000more, according to the London-based International SugarOrganization.    Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugarindustry in many countries in the region into a recession fromwhich it will be hard to recover.    Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic'sNational Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boostproduction even if prices recovered sharply.    Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transportand badly maintained plantations were barriers to any shortterm recovery in output, he added.    Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugarexporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the endof the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output isrunning well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.    Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problemsand poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countriesunder special deals. Last year, bad weather added to itstroubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in1985.    The low world prices of recent years have led manycountries in the region to cut exportable production to levelswhere they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbeancountries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for whichthey receive prices well above free market levels.    Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led toproduction stagnating or falling rather than being shifted tothe free world market.    Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. Inboth 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this yearits quota is only 37,000.    A national cooperative official said that, as long as worldmarket levels continue at around half of Peru's productioncost, the future of the industry is uncertain.    At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officialsstressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar canewhich, according to the group's executive-secretary EduardoLatorre, "grows like a weed" throughout the region.    Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane inexcess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined intosugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.    The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and AlcoholInstitute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives fromforeign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.    Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over thepast year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meantBrazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments tonext year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking pointbeing how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery ofsugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which wouldcost eight cents to replace.    Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar exportsales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, withthe Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages ofeither alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuilddepleted reserve stockpiles.    However, the situation could change dramatically if theeconomy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.    Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold littlehope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitabilityunless the U.S. And EC change their policies.    "The agricultural policies of the European Community and ofthe United States have caused our economies incalculable harmby closing their markets, by price deterioration ininternational commerce and furthermore by the unfaircompetition in third countries," Brazil's Trade and IndustryMinister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEAmeeting.    The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA forwhat the group charges is its continued dumping of excessoutput on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is themain cause of low prices.    GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement whichwould regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling theregion's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreementwould have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialisedcountries would have to see it as a political rather than amerely economic pact.    "They have to realise that the more our economies suffer,the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay theregion's 360 billion dollar foreign debt," GEPLACEA's Latorresaid. Reuter
CZARNIKOW EXPECTS LOWER EUROPEAN SUGAR OUTPUT European sugar output on the basis ofthree year average yields will be over half a mln tonnes whitevalue down on last year although yields do vary widely fromyear to year, broker C Czarnikow said in its market review.    European Community sowings are likely to be down comparedwith last year. There have been suggestions these sowings mightrespond to the recent upsurge in world prices, but Czarnikowsaid "it is not the sort of fact that easily becomes known."    The broker bases its forecasts on Licht planting estimateswhich put W Germany, the Netherlands and USSR lower butHungary, Romania, Poland, Turkey and Yugoslavia higher.

CUBAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN AT 7.5 MLN TONNES Cuban sugar output this season (1986/87)is put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikowin its monthly sugar market review.    Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year'sdomestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for exportof which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will betaken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries andthe remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations.    Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln importsfrom Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and exportneeds of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes tobe acquired from the world market. Soviet purchases to date maynot be far short of that quantity, Czarnikow said. Reuter
EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET Sugar which EC producers plan to sellinto intervention may be offered by the European Commission forsale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in itslatest sugar review.    The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a verynominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to theintervention price, with detrimental consequences forproducers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as anattempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrenderedsugar.    The Commission may also take other steps to dissuadeproducers from their chosen course, such as removing the timelimit on storage contracts, which presently means thatintervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September,Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of productionquotas being reduced.    If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders forexport, the restitutions would have to be higher than those atrecent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the differencebetween the EC price and the world market price, the extracosts might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says.    The producers might have to repay these costs throughproduction levies and the proposed special elimination levy,Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costscould be recovered under EC rules.    The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes ofsugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with theEC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed tobridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price,Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form ofprotest designed to force the Commission's hand.    In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered forintervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensurethat the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price,West German producers face a further price reduction in Julywith a probable revaluation of the "green" mark.    Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem isnot expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared totraders for some years that the EC's export policy isinsufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, itsays.    The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand byincreasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says,suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cutdown the amount of "unnecessary bureaucracy" surrounding theexport tender system.

COSTA RICA SELLS SUGAR TO SOVIET UNION Costa Rica has agreed to sell morethan 32,000 tonnes of sugar this year to the Soviet Union, aspokesman for local producers said.     Miguel Alfaro, president of the agricultural league of thesugar cane industry, said the sale follows a recent 50 pct cutin Costa Rica's quota for sugar exports to the U.S.    Alfaro said up to 45,000 tonnes of sugar could be exportedto the Soviet Union this year under the deal, which is similarto one the Soviets made recently with the Dominican Republic.    A Soviet ship will load 25,000 tonnes at the Pacific portof Punta Morales Monday, Alfaro said, and a second ship willtake an additional 7,107 tonnes two days later.

NEW CHIEF ELECTED FOR WORLD SUGAR ORGANISATION Dominican Alfredo Ricart will take overas executive director of the International Sugar Organization(ISO) in mid-April, ISO officer in charge Constantin Politoffsaid.    Previous ISO chief William Miller retired at end-Februarylast year.    Ricart told Reuters his first aim is put the "house in order"by having a new administrative sugar pact with improvedallocations of voting rights and financial contributions.    Once this is done, time can be dedicated to working towardsa new International Sugar Agreement (ISA) with economicclauses, he said.    Ricart, currently the Dominican Republic's ambassador toAustria, the Netherlands and the UN in Geneva, said he willvisit the four major exporters - Australia, Brazil, Cuba andthe European Community - to talk to governments and producersand find out about problems that are preventing these countriesfinding common ground for a new sugar pact.

INTERNATIONAL SUGAR PACT TO BE RENEGOTIATED The International Sugar Agreement (ISA)will be renegotiated, International Sugar Organization (ISO)officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after aspecial session of the pact's council.    A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISOsix monthly session in May. The alternatives are between anautumn London conference for another pact without economicclauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or aGeneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economicclauses, he said.    But delegates said the latter would only be considered ifthe world's four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba andthe European Community -- can resolve differences over howprices can best be supported and how to share the world    Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlierindicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share ofthe ISO budget.    At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would tryand find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg laterthis year. Currently, about three quarters of this year's ISO800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said theU.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its fullcontribution in the last year of the current pact.    The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISObudget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importersand exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of theimporter half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only asingle category of members who would all share the costs prorata to their share of world sugar trade.

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS Three geographically diverse droughtsin Asia are being linked by some scientists to areintensification of the complex and little-understood El Ninoweather pattern, <Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weatherforecasting service, said.    Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcanegrowers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all faceserious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrivein time to break the droughts, offical reports, governmentofficials and meteorologists said.    Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, saidthe drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinceshave been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.    Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.    Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuanwas 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure forover 20 years, the paper said.    The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pctcompared with last March and lowered the water levels of manyrivers, it added.    This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causingshortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of theYangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing manyships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.    Unusually high temperatures have also been reported acrossChina, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan hasrecorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than averagesince early February.    The New China News Agency said the average Decembertemperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higherthan last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.    Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lankaand threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry ofPlantation Industries officials told Reuters    In Australia, concern is growing about below-averagerainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along theQueensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, localMeteorological Bureau officials said.    For many farmers and government officials the fear is thatwhile the present low rainfall does not yet pose a majorthreat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when thewheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.    Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 droughtwhich devastated the wheat crop and coincided with theoccurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known asEl Nino, they said.    Although meteorologists are cautious about linking theAsia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any singlecause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.    Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data foragriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event'was unique.    The El Nino does not always produce the same effects andthe present occurrence is much less pronounced than the lastmajor event in 1982/83, it said.    El Nino, Spanish for "Christ Child" because it appears aroundChristmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing cloudsand rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coastof Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated withthe Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the tradewinds, meteorologists said.    The winds, strengthened by El Nino's "pump" effect, raise thesea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.    When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sendsa surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where itcollides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.    One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect therain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into thePacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.    The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weathersaid.    China, where the affected areas have received between 40and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for theMay-September rains, it said.    The May-September rains normally provide thedrought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.    In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip havereceived less than half the normal rainfall during the currentwet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishingas the rainy season draws to an end.    In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should beat its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usuallyoccur between April and June, although it is not possible atthis stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual. REUTER

U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA The U.S. Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal todrastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growersfor the cut with targeted income payments.    In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanyingthe "Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987", Peter Myers,Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administrationwants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginningwith the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.    Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by thegovernment for the price support cut with targeted incomepayments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments wouldcost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.    The administration sugar proposal is expected to beintroduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.John Porter, R-Ill.    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic itis unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate becausepolitically-influential sugar and corn growersand high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and graduallylowers payments over four years. It also excludes from paymentany output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a growerwould receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.    The income payments would be based on the amount ofcommercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changesin the sugar program because the current high price support iscausing adverse trends in the sugar industry.    He said the current program has artificially stimulateddomestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowedcorn sweeteners to make market inroads.    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a"progressive contraction" of the sugar import quota to only onemln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugarrefiners who rely on imported sugar processing.    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program givesoverseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products acompetitive advantage. The result has been higher imports ofsugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processingfacilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost onU.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA saidconsumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more thannecessary for sugar.    "Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap betweensweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverseimpacts and trends which the sugar industry is currentlyfacing," Myers said.    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts perlb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tonsrecoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal tocompensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

BEGHIN-SAY SEES SOLUTION TO EC SUGAR DISPUTE A settlement could soon be reached in thedispute between European sugar producers and the EuropeanCommunity over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes,president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leadingthe protest, told journalists today.    "Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few daysindicate that we are moving towards a solution," he said, addingthat if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention.    Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes ofsugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC'spolicy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failedto give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtainby offering sugar into EC intervention.    At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparentconcession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 Europeancurrency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producerssay is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate whichwas 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.    Vernes would not say what form any compromise between theproducers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed thelong-term desire of producers to export to the world market,providing they were not losing money by doing so.    Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, orat any time over the following five weeks before the officialpayment date.    The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internalmarket if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers. REUTER

WEST GERMAN 1986 SUGAR OUTPUT RISES West German sugar production last yearrose 38,000 tonnes to an estimated 3.17 mln tonnes, theAgricultural Ministry said.    It said the increase was exclusively due to higher beetsugar content, which went up to 17.93 pct from 17.3 pct in1985.    Last year's beet deliveries totalled 20.22 mln tonnes, down554,000 tonnes from the previous year.

EC COLD AID FOOD SCHEME MAY BE MADE PERMANENT Emergency action to distributeEuropean Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has provedso successful that the EC executive Commission may propose apermanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said.    Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC storesbetween January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved thescheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures.    The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnesof sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, hasbeen distributed to the needy through charities.    The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure tohelp poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winterand will end on March 31.    But the spokesman said the commission will consider whetherto propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system.    The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporaryscheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units(72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr)ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers.    However, commission sources said the real cost was small ifaccount is taken of the expense of keeping food in store untilits quality and value deteriorates.

JAPAN'S 1986/87 SUGAR CANE OUTPUT SEEN FALLING An Agriculture Ministry survey hasestimated the nation's 1986/87 crop sugar cane output at 2.14mln tonnes, down from 2.62 mln a year earlier.    Ministry officials said the decline was due to bad weatherand a reduction in the land under sugar cane this season, whichtotals 34,800 hectares, down from 35,700 in 1985/86, they said.    Harvesting stretches from December 1986 to April 1987    Japan's final output will be announced at the beginning ofJune, they said. REUTER
UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDS EC SUGAR TENDER RESULT-TRADE Considerable uncertainty surrounds theoutcome of today's EC white sugar tender, traders here said,noting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats tomove over 800,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.    They said that due to the dispute between the Commissionand producers over the issue, it is not clear whether theCommission will authorise any exports at all or grant licenceson a large tonnage.    The subsidy is seen being set above 45.00 Ecus per 100kilos, although traders are reluctant to predict a preciselevel after prices fell yesterday.    Earlier, traders in Paris said they expected the Commissionto award licences for around 50,000 tonnes of white sugar witha maximum export rebate of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus.    Last week, the Commission granted licences to end August on60,500 tonnes of whites at a maximum rebate of 44.819. REUTER

THAI SUGAR PRODUCTION CONTINUES HIGH IN FEB Thai sugar production continued at ahigh level in February, latest figures received by theInternational Sugar Organization (ISO) show.    The figures show stocks at end-February of 2.49 mln tonnesraw value against 2.33 mln a year earlier. Analysts said thiswas a new peak for the date.    Production in February was 961,000 tonnes against 888,000in February 1986 and took the Nov/Feb total for the currentcrop to 2.25 mln tonnes. Production normally tails off sharplyafter March, but in recent years production from March to theend of the crop has been over 500,000 tonnes, analysts said.    Thailand's exports in February were 32,800 tonnes andconsumption 57,800.    Last month the Thai Agriculture Ministry said 1986/87production was expected to fall to 2.3 mln tonnes from 2.48 mlnin 1985/86. Reuter
EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS FURTHER CONCESSION The rebates granted at yesterday's ECsugar tender represent a further concession to producers'complaints that they are losing money on exports outside thebloc, trade sources said.    They said the maximum rebate of 45.678 European currencyUnits (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 0.87 Ecus below what producersclaim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offeredfor sales into intervention.    The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of thelevel producers thought necessary and that of the previous weekwas 2.5 Ecus below this level.    But the sources said producers who have offered a total of854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparentattempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximumrebates have given no formal indication to the Commission thatthey intend to withdraw these offers.    The French and German operators involved would be able towithdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when thesugar will officially enter intervention stores.    The five-week period is the normal delay between sugargoing into intervention and payment being made for it.    EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buythe sugar, it is determined immediately to resell it, a movewhich could drive down market prices further. REUTER

FRANCE WILL FIGHT EC FARM PROPOSALS - MINISTER French Agricultural MinisterFrancois Guillaume warned that France would flatly rejectproposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugarand oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt thesemarkets.    The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the interventionperiod and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase thefinancial burden on the sugar producers will also result inlower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.    "I give you my word that France, while it will not rejecttechnical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply replyin the negative to these bad reforms," Guillaume told the annualconference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).    Community agricultural ministers are due to meet againMonday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spirallingEC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.    Relations between the government and farmers have becomestrained in France in recent months.    There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations byfarmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices andfurther cutbacks in Community milk output.    But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisationof the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a majorproducer of both crops -- won him warm applause from theFNSEA's farmers.    His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for thecomplete dismantling of the system of cross border taxesdesigned to smooth out currency differences known as MonetaryCompensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoidfurther protests by producers.    Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to goahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroadagainst the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farmsector.    "The Minister's proposals back up our determination toorganise union action in the coming weeks," he told reporters,adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on aministerial level.    Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before beingappointed farm minister last spring.    Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt thatGuillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.    There have been certain advances on cutting productioncosts, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, butthere are still areas where more could be done such as onfarmers' indebtedness, he said.    Guillaume told the conference the government will makeavailable 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producersreduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.    The government has already announced financial aid for themilk sector and it was not clear how much of the packageannounced today was new aid, Lacombe said. Reuter
PHILIPPINES TO LOBBY U.S. FOR HIGHER SUGAR QUOTA The Philippines will ask the U.S.Agriculture Department (USDA) to increase its 1987 sugar importquota following market reports that Taiwan will not be able tofulfil its quota, Sugar Regulation Administration (SRA)chairman Arsenim Yulo said.    Yulo told Reuters the SRA would also protest a USDA move toaward Taiwan's shortfall to the Dominican Republic.    The Dominican Republic already has a larger sugar quota,Yulo said. "Any Taiwanese shortfall should be awarded to thePhilippines or at the least we should share a hike with theDominican Republic."    The USDA last December listed 1987 sugar import quotaallocations for the Dominican Republic at 160,160 short tonsand for Taiwan at 10,920 short tons.    The Philippines has said it was badly hit by a cut in itsquota to 143,780 short tons from 231,660 in 1986. REUTER
PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1.6 MLN TONNES Philippine sugar production in the1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, SugarRegulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.    Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current millingseason, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimatewould almost certainly be met.    He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop wouldbe earmarked for domestic consumption.    Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for theU.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.    He said if the government approved a long-standing SRArecommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would takeup another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.    "The government, for its own reasons, has been delayingapproval of the project, but we expect it to come through byJuly," Yulo said.    Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oilimport bill by about 300 mln pesos.    Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready tostart manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.    The ethanol project would result in employment for about100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work bydepressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.    Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, hadbeen submitted to President Corazon Aquino.    "I think the President would rather wait till the newCongress convenes after the May elections," he said. "But thereis really no need for such quotas. We are right now producingjust slightly over our own consumption level."    "The producers have never enjoyed such high prices," Yulosaid, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesosper picul, up from 190 pesos last August.    Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculationfollowing the SRA's bid to control production.    "We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,"he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned fromtheir mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming andcloth production.    He said diversification into products other than ethanolwas also possible within the sugar industry.    "The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons," Yulo said."They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but theyrelocated many of them and diversified production. We want tocall this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry."    He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, usedfor thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.    "When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to producesugar," he said.    Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of theInternational Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.    "As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a newagreement which would revive world prices," Yulo said.    "If there is no agreement world prices will always bedepressed, particularly because the European Community issubsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets."    He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, whereproduction costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.    "If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents Iexpect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the endof this year," he said.    Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by1990, with world consumption outstripping production.    He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachmentsfrom artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.    "But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration," hesaid. "Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to theU.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cutours in half without any justification."    Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cutdomestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.    The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.    Yulo said despite next year's increased production target,some Philippine mills were expected to shut down.    "At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the1986/87 season," he said. "We expect two or three more to followsuit during the next season." REUTER
SUGAR MARKET SEES GOOD RECENT OFFTAKE Reports the Soviet Union has latelyextended its recent buying programme by taking five to eightraws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points underNew York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand forsugar for a variety of destinations, traders said.    The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India,Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China.    Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands incurrent activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade whichpreviously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added.    Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the SovietUnion in the past few days involved Japanese operators sellingThai origin sugar.    Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightenedconsiderably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possiblyfor sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large blockenquiries by China, they said.    Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened toaround 13/14 points under May New York from larger discountspreviously, they added.    Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy moresugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirementthis year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said.    Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases oftwo to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne costand freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyerthis week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for anundisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added.    Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyerphysicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emergedrecently when prices took an interim technical dip, traderssaid.    Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes ofwhites although traders said the tender, originally scheduledfor tomorrow, might not take place until a week later.    Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival whitesugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tenderfor 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, forarrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August.

EC EXTENDS PARTS OF FREE FOOD FOR POOR SCHEME A scheme to distribute surplus foodfree to the poor in the European Community (EC), which was dueto expire next Tuesday, will be partially extended for afurther month, an EC Commission spokesman said.    He added the executive Commission has not yet decidedwhether the scheme should become a permanent feature of theEC's struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farmproduce.    Almost 60,000 tonnes of cereals, sugar, beef, butter andother food have been authorised for distribution under anoperation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 inwhich charities act as executive Commission agents.    The original idea was to help the needy survive this year'sunusually cold European winter.    The spokesman said the Commission was extending the schemefully in Greece, which has recently been hit by unseasonalsnowstorms, for the month of April.    Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks offood for which they have already applied under the scheme up toApril 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution offlour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high ratenext month.    He said the Commission, which has powers to continue mostaspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further,will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent.    Cost, which has already reached around 65 mln Europeancurrency units, would be a major consideration.    End-January stocks included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter,520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals. REUTER
AUSTRALIAN SUGAR AREAS SAID RECEIVING SOME RAIN Dry areas of the Australian sugar canebelt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enoughrain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar ProducersAssociation spokesman said.    The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, butrainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains areneeded in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackayregions, he said from Brisbane.    Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the stateand in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking verygood after heavy falls this month, he said.    The spokesman said it is still too early to tell whateffect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, whichis harvested from around June to December.    He said frequent but light falls in the areas that areshort of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only needabout three days of the region's heavy tropical rains torestore normal moisture to the cane.    But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucialto the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said.

ANALYSTS APPLAUD CSR'S BOLD MOVE TO SELL DELHI CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> has made a bold move inselling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs andploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, shareanalysts said.    "It sounds like a good deal," Stuart McKibbin of <A.C. Goodeand Co> told Reuters.    CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gasinterests held in the <Delhi Australia Fund> and would insteadsell it to Exxon Corp <XON> unit <Esso Exploration andProduction Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs.    In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largestsugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct itdoes not already hold in <Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>.    "This will be a big shock to the market, which was under theimpression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,"McKibbin said.    A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had givenitself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark onan ambitious expansion programme in its best-performingdivisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.    CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the rightto share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from anoil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.    Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producersyielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin.Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrsfor every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.    Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker <Bain and Co Ltd>said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industrywas a sensible one but added that it represented the loss ofAustralian-owned assets to a foreign company.    "The farm they bought back a few years ago is being soldback to the Americans," Goldston-Morris said.    The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far thelargest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industryand would give it access to some of the best sugar propertiesand mills in the country, analysts said.    They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommendacceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from thebottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.    Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne nextseason from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.    Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaginginvestment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company'soverall performance, analysts said.    CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses onwhat had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirelyfrom U.S. Dollar debt, they said.    "It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirelywith debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oilprice collapsed on them," Owen Evans of Sydney broker <Mearesand Philips Ltd> said.    Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but alsogained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax lossesaccumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions.    Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stakein Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd<BRKN.S>.    "Esso has been very keen to diversify from the GippslandBasin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait latelyand Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,"Goldston-Morris said. REUTER
COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET Consuming countries, chastened by thecollapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price supportoperations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before thatcommodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they areserving, a Reuter survey showed.    They want price ranges to be more responsive to markettrends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining theaccords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoidthe risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.    Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned ageneralised approach to commodity price stabilisation andprefer to assess each commodity case by case, the surveyshowed.    The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week setprecise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could dounder the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchaselimits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures marketsand stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct oftotal buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. Thiswill help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, theworld's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.    The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the BufferStock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.    A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) wasadopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exportingcountries agreed several changes to make the reference pricemore responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisionsunder which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to financeoperations. Direct cash contributions from members will fundbuffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular featureof the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses runninginto hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.    Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiationsin London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist thatagreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.    Consumers and a small group of producers argued that"objective criteria" should be used to define export quotashares, which would have meant a reduction in the share ofBrazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintainits previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,delegates and trade sources see chances of any near termnegotiations on export quota distribution as remote.    International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. Thesedo not have any economic clauses but provide a forum fordiscussions on possible future economic agreements, collectstatistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts saiddifferences between sugar exporting countries have held up anyprogress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheercompetition between major exporters amid a world grain glutmilitate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.    An alternative focus for commodity discussions areinternational study groups, made up of governments with advicefrom industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.    The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planneddirectly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed tobecome operational because neither the U.S. Nor the SovietUnion has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said theU.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,citing the lack of widespread support.    U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials inKuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commoditypact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing tostudy individual cases for economically sound, market-orientedcommodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.    "We see little to be gained by attempting to increase theprice of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,"official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currentlybelongs to only two international commodity agreements thathave economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement(ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheatpacts.    The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreementbecause it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic andnot designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRAas the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.    U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other membersof the pact to agree that the price review and adjustmentmechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflectmarket trends and also to continue the accord as a marketoriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.    Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they haveconsistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts onthe merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries MinisterLim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, theworld's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides itsparticipation in international commodity pacts case by case.    Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin ProducingCountries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPClaunched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnesfor a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from70,000.    Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture anddelegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron toldReuters in London, "Agreements with economic clauses tostabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges wereclose to market reality, if there was full participation byproducers and consumers, and if participants were prepared totake their obligations in the framework of the agreementseriously."    But Baron added, "No real sanctions are available for acountry that doesn't stick to its obligations...The Germanapproach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the bestinstrument to help developing countries. They were never meantto be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is howdeveloping countries often interpret them."    Traditionally Britain has always been supportive ofcommodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with ThirdWorld producing countries. But recently demands for morestringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on theneed for "intellectual honesty" and "objective criteria" havegrown.    British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to bea two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.    It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving directmarket participation through a buffer stock have a high degreeof transparency and do not contain the risk of open-endedborrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices toreflect changes in market structure and price trends ratherthan dictate what prices should be.    A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges pricerealism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.    A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourableto commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer ofsugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the realmarket situation, particularly regarding stocks.    Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja toldReuters in Jakarta: "These agreements can work as long as theproblems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there arestructural problems..But we are still committed to commodityagreements as an act of faith." Nicaraguan External TradeMinister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producerscannot afford not to give their backing to commodityagreements.    "The political will is not there on the part of someconsumers to make agreements work," Martinez Cuenca said.    The head of the economics department in the BrazilianForeign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters anagreement can be successful if it keeps a link with marketreality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a systemof quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pactand actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman GrahamShanley said consuming countries realise steady export earningsenhance developing countries' ability to service debt and meangreater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.

CSR SELLS OIL/GAS INTERESTS, BIDS TO EXTEND SUGAR CSR Ltd has made a bold move in sellingits oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs andploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, shareanalysts said.    CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gasinterests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would insteadsell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and ProductionAustralia Inc for 985 mln dlrs.    In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largestsugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct itdoes not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.    A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright CSR had givenitself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on anambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisionsof sugar and building products, analysts said.    The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far thelargest stake in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industryand access to some of the best sugar properties and mills inthe country, they said. Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommendacceptance of the bid, through which CSR would benefit from thebottoming out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices. REUTER
U.S. SUGARBEET PLANTINGS SEEN RISING IN 1987 Representatives of U.S. sugar growerorganizations said they expect some increase the area plantedto sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987cane sugar crop also are good.    Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association,said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states,California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightlyin the largest producing state of Minnesota.    Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in themidwest, and this coupled with increases in California wouldincrease U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mlnacres sown last year.    USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S.sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report.    The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowingsis that returns from competing crops such as soybeans andgrains are "just awful," said Carter.    In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers toplant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loanrate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers frombeet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, saidLuther Markwart, executive vice president of the Americansugarbeet growers association.    "The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,"Markwart said.    In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking acontract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said.    USDA's report today will not include any harvested areaestimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaiiand Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good.    Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texascane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  becausefor the first time in several years there was no winter freeze.Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year,cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said.    In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year,but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields,said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian SugarPlanters Association.    The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more thanthe usual amount of attention this year because of mountingconcern that continued increases in domestic sugar productionthreaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said.    The increases in beet plantings have especially causedconcern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings,particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said.    "We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet andcane areas in more than five years," said Godfrey, adding thatthe U.S. may be due for a good weather year.    Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the Houseagriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, hasthreatened to offer legislation next year to curb domesticsweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.

BEGHIN-SAY SAYS SUGAR OFFER TO EC STILL STANDS A plan by European producers to sell854,000 tonnes of sugar to European Community interventionstocks still stands, Andrea Minguzzi, an official at Frenchsugar producer Beghin-Say, said.    Last week Beghin-Say president Jean-Marc Vernes said apossible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producersto withdraw their offer, which was made as a protest against ECexport licensing policies.    The EC policy is to offer export rebates, which fail togive producers an equivalent price to that which they would getby offering sugar into intervention stocks, Vernes said.    But Minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair andthat producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offeralready lodged with intervention boards of different Europeancountries. He said final quality approval for all the sugaroffered could come later this week. Some 95 pct had alreadycleared quality specifications.    The EC can only reject an offer to sell into interventionstocks on quality grounds. Minguzzi added that under ECregulations, the Community has until early May to pay for thesugar. He declined to put an exact figure on the amount ofsugar offered by Beghin-Say, but said it was below 500,000tonnes. Reuter

BRITISH SUGAR SOWINGS OFF TO SLOW START Drilling of this year's British sugarbeet crop got off to a slow start due to poor weatherconditions with only around one pct sown so far, a spokesmanfor British Sugar Plc said.    This compares with two pct at the same stage last year,three pct in 1985 and 38 to 39 pct in 1984.    There is little cause for concern with better weatherforecast and the capacity available to drill the contractedarea of around 200,000 hectares in about 10 days. Seed bedslook good and farmers are advised to wait for soil temperaturesto rise, the spokesman said.    "If the crop can be drilled by the third week in April wewill be delighted," he said. Last year a large proportion of thecrop was not drilled until May but it still turned out to bethe equal second largest on record. Reuter

EC SUGAR TENDER SAID TO MARK NO CHANGE IN POLICY The maximum rebate granted atyesterday's European Community (EC) sugar tender marked nochange in policy towards producers' complaints that they arelosing money on exports outside the EC, EC commission sourcessaid.    They said this was despite the fact that the commissionaccepted over 785,000 tonnes of sugar into interventionyesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being settoo low.    The maximum rebate at yesterday's tender was 46.864 Ecusper 100 kilos, up from 45.678 Ecus the previous week.    London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largestever granted. The commission sources said today the increasewas entirely explained by world market conditions. The amountby which the rebate fell short of what producers claim isneeded to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales intointervention remained at 0.87 Ecus per 100 kilos, they said.    Operators offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar intointervention last month to protest at rebates which they saidwere too low. The sources said about 706,470 tonnes of Frenchsugar and 79,000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted, theremainder being rejected as of too low quality.    The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offersin the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar andpayment for it.    They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet,adding that they would expect operators to wait another week ortwo to review commission policy before making up their minds.

The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn.,would require quotas on the import of any merchandisecontaining over 25 pct sugar or other farm products which arenow subject to U.S. quotas.    Supporters of the amendment said it is aimed at curbingshipments of food products containing sugar from Canada.However, the Ways and Means committee, which has overalljurisdiction on trade legislation, will try to kill theamendment as protectionist, a committee aide said.    An Agriculture committee aide acknowledged the proposalprobably will not survive scrutiny by other House committees.But he said the amendment was introduced in part to send awarning to U.S. companies considering moving food processingplants to Canada to avoid the restrictive U.S. sugar quota.    In debate on the amendment yesterday, Rep. Stangeland andother supporters said the proposal would have no effect on thestatus of foreign trade zones.    Sugar producer groups pushed for the amendment onsugar-containing products because they believe sugar is beingshipped to the United States in food products as a way tocircumvent the quota on raw sugar.

RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING The recent fall in world sugar prices,due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of exportavailability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from Chinaand the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.    Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic ofChina at the lower end of the recent price range, which shouldlimit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthlymarket report.   "And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to returnto the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes forMay/June shipment, Man added.    The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/Mayshipment towards the end of last month, which brings its totalpurchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.    Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mlntonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is beingcountered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.    Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop couldbe close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similarproduction Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.    Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocksin September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used toboost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will notbe able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimatesCuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mlntonnes.    However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporterswith reduced availability, Man said.    Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallento 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time freemarket demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, whichhas left exporters chasing falling import requirements.    A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But thedifficult task of keeping production advances at bay stillremains, as at least one more season of production deficit isneeded to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks stilloverhanging the market, Man said.    The increasing cases of record production as a result ofrecord yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producersto strive for greater efficiency.    As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost ofproduction, sugar exporters may become more responsive toprices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.    Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission andsugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in thelevel of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fullycompensate producers when exporting on the world market.    Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugaris expected to remain in intervention, it added. REUTER
BEGHIN-SAY NOT PLANNING TO WITHDRAW SUGAR French sugar producer Beghin-Say is notcurrently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed intointervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded atthis week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-SayPresident Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters.    The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos onWednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders.    Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission hasstarted to move in the right direction, but said his companyhad no plans to change its decision to put sugar intointervention.    But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a finalagreement would be reached with the commission which wouldallow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention.    European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar intointervention to protest about export rebates which they say aretoo low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by thecommission on Wednesday, according to commission sources.    Under EC regulations, however, operators have another fourto five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention beforepayment is made for it.    A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnesof West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, tradesources said here. This amount represents about a third ofannual EC exports to non-EC countries.    Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it hadoffered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000tonnes.    Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus onevery 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fullybridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebatewas 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get anequivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traderssaid.    Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates tothe full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was astep in the right direction.    Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorisedfor export since the begining of the current campaign had beeninadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate.    Trade sources said new regulations governing exportrebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth thepath for the commission to award larger export rebates infuture.    One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemedthe commission had understood the protest action and was nowmoving towards adapting the situation accordingly, therebyallowing the operators to withdraw their sugar fromintervention once they got satisfaction.

RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP Good rains of one to four inches in thepast 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops inthe Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, anAustralian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.    As previously reported, the region has been undergoing asevere dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, sinceDecember, following the virtual failure of the summer wetseason.    Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops arebeginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growthsince the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.    Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much betterthan it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesmansaid.

 UK INTERVENTION BD SAYS EC SOLD 118,350 TONNES WHITE SUGAR AT REBATE 46.4 West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countrieswould look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord onstabilizing foreign exchange rates.    Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weaknessof the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries andCanada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.    But he declined to say what measures would be discussedahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers latertoday.    Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl saidthe importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvreaccord, had been underestimated.    Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among majorcountries than six months ago, at the time of the annualmeeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,marked by sharp discord between the United States and its majortrading partners.    "There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord," hesaid. "We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I donot want to discuss that here.    Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a"slight firming" of the yen against the dollar.    And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchangedsince February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sellmarks to support the dollar.    "The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market," hesaid.

DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED Roughly half of this year's expected130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in theNetherlands, told Reuters.    Conditions are generally good and the average sowing datefor the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesmanadded.    "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we canexpect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least thecrop is off to a very good start," he said.    Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes ofwhite sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.    This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has beenintroduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.    Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have beenallotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area beingboosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar. Reuter
EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN MARKING NO CHANGE IN POLICY The maximum export rebate granted atyesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy overproducer complaints that they are not obtaining the ECintervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, ECCommission sources said.    The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previousweek, but the change is explained by world market conditions.    Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed toobtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over oneEcu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,the sources said.    They said this was despite the fact that the Commission hadto accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention fromoperators protesting that rebates are too low.    Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar.But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unlessthe Commission reviews its export policy, they said. REUTER

U.S. CONGRESSMAN INTRODUCES REAGAN SUGAR BILL Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introducedin the House of Representatives legislation proposed by theReagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, aspokesman for Porter said.    The spokesman said the bill was introduced without anychanges from the administration's proposal sent to Congresslast month.    That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would becompensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments togrowers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.    Representatives of sugar growers have rejected theproposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry. Reuter
SMUGGLING BLAMED FOR CLOSURE OF HAITIAN SUGAR FIRM A sugar mill which was thisnation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled fromMiami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.    The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,the company said.    "Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCOregrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar caneafter April 10," the mill warned planters earlier this week.    Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteenmonths ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cookingoil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumerprices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwinghundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.    At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up toreceive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed awarehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound(45-kg) bags of sugar.    "We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.We have no money left to continue operations," Rigaud said.    He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed anadditional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.    Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvaliertwo years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.    He said the government then began importing refined sugarat world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit andthe provisional military-civilian government that replacedDuvalier last year continued the policy.    "But now with all the smuggling even the state can't competewith smuggled Dominican refined sugar," Rigaud said.    HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably abovethe usual minimum wage of three dlrs.    It is generally estimated that every employed Haitiansupports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at aminimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.    Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. "We're dead,and it's the government that's causing us to die," declaredLucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents. REUTER

JAPANESE BUYERS ACCEPT CUBA SUGAR DELAY - TRADERS Several Japanese buyers have acceptedpostponement of between 150,000 and 200,000 tonnes of Cuban rawsugar scheduled for delivery in calendar 1987 until next yearfollowing a request from Cuba, trade sources said.    Cuba had sought delays for some 300,000 tonnes ofdeliveries, they said. It made a similar request in Januarywhen Japanese buyers agreed to postpone some 200,000 tonnes ofsugar deliveries for 1987 until 1988.    Some buyers rejected the Cuban request because they havealready sold the sugar on to refiners, they added.    Japanese buyers are believed to have contracts to buy some950,000 tonnes of raw sugar from Cuba for 1987 shipment.    But Japan's actual raw sugar imports from Cuba are likelyto total only some 400,000 to 450,000 tonnes this year, against576,990 in 1986, reflecting both the postponements and salesearlier this year by Japanese traders of an estimated 150,000tonnes of Cuban sugar to the USSR for 1987 shipment, they said.    They estimated Japan's total sugar imports this year at 1.8mln tonnes, against 1.81 mln in 1986, of which Australia isexpected to supply 550,000, against 470,000, South Africa350,000, against 331,866, and Thailand 400,000, after 390,776.

EUROPEAN BEET SOWINGS CATCH UP, USSR DELAYED Fine weather throughout Europeallowed farmers to make good progress with sugar beet sowingsduring the period April 16-21, but conditions in the SovietUnion remained unfavourable, West German analyst F.O. Lichtsaid.    With daytime temperatures in parts of Europe exceeding 20degrees centigrade Licht said sowings have been boosted and maybe completed in most countries by the end of the month.    In France the beet growers' association said the entirecrop could be sown within a week if the good weather persists.    Sowings this year will still be behind 1986 but Licht notedthat good results have often been produced from late-sowncrops.    In the Soviet Union, however, most beet-growing regionsstill had cool weather with night frosts. Only in the westernUkraine was it warm enough to permit sowings, Licht said.    Sowings in the USSR will consequently be much later thanlast year when one mln hectares had already been drilled bymid-April. Reuter
GERMAN INTERVENTION SUGAR FOR EXPORT - LDN TRADE The most likely reason for West Germanproducers withdrawing white sugar from intervention stores isthat they already have, or are reasonably certain of, obtainingEuropean Community (EC) export licences for it, traders said.    They were responding to EC Commission sources in Brusselssaying West German producers have withdrawn most of the 79,250tonnes of the sugar they put into intervention on April 1.    The traders said it is also likely that French producers,who put over 700,000 tonnes into intervention, will withdraw asignificant proportion of this for the same reason before theyare due to accept payment for the sugar in early May.    Earlier this week traders said the stepping up of the levelof export licences being granted by the EC at recent tenders,with generous subsidies, had been due to producer threats toleave the sugar in intervention and to a desire to move most ofthe old crop sugar before the new crop tenders start in May.    The EC has so far granted licences for 2,467,970 tonnes outof around 3.1 mln tonnes targetted for export in the 1986/87series of tenders. This would indicate the likelihood of hightonnages continuing to be moved over the next few tenders andsubsidies also remaining high in order to attract producer bidsfor the export licences, traders said.

SOAKING RAINS BOOST DRY AUSTRALIAN SUGAR CANE AREA Good soaking rain is boosting the sugarcane crop in the key Mackay region of Queensland following aprolonged dry spell relieved only by intermittent falls, anAustralian Sugar Producers Association spokesman told Reuters.    The rains began late last week, developed into heavydownpours over the weekend and are continuing today, he saidfrom Brisbane.    The Mackay and Burdekin regions, which together grow abouthalf the Australian cane crop, have been the Queensland caneareas hardest hit by unseasonal dry weather since December.    The spokesman said the rain missed the Burdekin area, justto the north of the Mackay region on the central Queenslandcoastal fringe, although recent light showers have freshenedthe crop there.    Owing to the dry spell in the Mackay and Burdekin areas,the overall 1987 Australian cane crop is likely to be below the25.4 mln tonnes crushed in 1986 for a 94 net titre raws outturnof 3.37 mln tonnes, he said.    But any decline will not be as great as seemed likely acouple of months ago when it appeared the Mackay-Burdekin cropswere going to suffer badly, he said.    Preliminary crop estimates are expected to be availableearly next month, the spokesman said.    The crush in the Mackay-Burdekin is likely to start laterthis year, in late June or early July against mid-June lastyear, to allow the cane to grow and sweeten further, he said.    The crush normally runs to around the end of December.    Elsewhere in the sugar belt, the cane is doing well, withsome mill areas expecting record crops, he said.    Industry records show variations in the crop are not alwaysmirrored in raws output. In 1985, 24.4 mln tonnes of sweetercane than in 1986 produced 3.38 mln tonnes of raws. REUTER

FRENCH PRODUCERS WITHDRAW SUGAR FROM INTERVENTION French producers have withdrawn alloffers to sell more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar into EuropeanCommunity intervention stocks, EC Commission sources said.    They also said West German producers had now withdrawn thelast 3,000 of the 79,250 tonnes they sold into EC stores onApril 1.    The sales were made to protest against the level of exportrestitutions being granted for sugar at weekly EC tenders.    Last Friday, commission sources said the West Germanproducers had withdrawn all but 3,000 tonnes of their sales.    The protest by European producers involved sales of 854,000tonnes of sugar into intervention, of which 785,000 tonnes wereaccepted by the commission.    Under EC regulations, operators had five weeks beforereceiving payment to withdraw the sugar.

ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT The Zambian government today announcedminor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its neweconomic strategy, while police and troops patrolled thenorthern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.    However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,were not affected by the cuts and many people said this couldprovoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected moresweeping reductions.    Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with thesmall extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct onitems such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.

In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no signof troops or police reinforcements on the streets.    President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to takeaccount of lower import costs following the revaluation of thekwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.

CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS China will not increase sugar importssubstantially this year because of foreign exchange constraintsand large stocks, despite falling production and risingdomestic demand, traders and the official press said.    "Despite rapid increases in domestic production over thelast 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue tobe extremely serious," the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, becausefarmers could earn more from other crops and because technicaland seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.    The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop(November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a yearearlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.    The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlierfigure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New ChinaNews Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.    The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong provincefell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that thearea under sugar was dropping.    "Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate," the newspapersaid. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation ofnearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of caneis a major problem."    A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop inarea planted.    He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were weldeveloped, enabling farmers to choose crops according to themaximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.    The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast provinceof Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only70 from one mu of sugarbeet.    The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.    Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competedwith each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted infalling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.    The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, theofficial press has said.    Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes ofsugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.    The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mlntonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.    A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocksin 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to importsugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986when the central government resumed control of imports.    "As China lacked storage, much of these imports was storedin Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas," the diplomatsaid.    The trader said transporting stocks from these areas toconsumers in east and south China was a problem, particularlyas coal had priority. "How quickly they can move the sugar isone factor determining import levels," he said.    Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.    "China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about152/153 dlrs a tonne," he added. "China is not a desperate buyernow. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go intothe open market."    A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regardingimports was price.    "While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,foreign exchange restraints persist," he said.    The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about fivepct a year but "a communist government is in a much betterposition to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if theforeign exchange situation demands it."

CUBA SUGAR HARVEST ENDS AFTER LONG DELAYS The Cuban sugar harvest, which wasextended almost a month and a half beyond its originallyscheduled shutdown date, ended here as the last of the island's154 mills closed operations, the official newspaper granmasaid.    The newspaper characterized the harvest, which began inlate November, 1986, as "a tense and pressured campaign."    In a recent interview with the French communist partynewspaper l'humanite, Cuban president Fidel Castro said thatcrude sugar production during the harvest would be "less than7.5 mln tonnes.    The harvest was plagued by a four year shortfall of rainwhich reduced the sugar content of the cane and by unseasonablerain storms during the first two months of this year which madecane cutting by mechanical combines virtually impossible.    Many foreign sugar experts voiced doubts during the presentharvest that raw sugar production would exceed last year's 7.2mln tonne mark.

President Charles Gillett said the tax was extending theCommission's powers by allowing it to set levels of consumertaxation, an area previously reserved for national treasuries. Reuter

TAIWAN RAISES SUGAR OUTPUT TARGET FOR 1987/88 Taiwan's target for sugar production inthe 1987/88 season (November/May) has been set at 600,000tonnes, up from the 479,200 tonnes harvested in 1986/87, aspokesman for the state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp told Reuters.    He said the increase was to meet rising local consumption,estimated at about 500,000 tonnes in calendar 1988 against470,000 tonnes in 1987. Taiwan would have a surplus for exportof about 100,000 tonnes in 1988, he said.    In 1987 Taiwan would have no exportable sugar for the firsttime in 40 years because of typhoon damage to more than 6,000hectares of canefield in 1986, he said. REUTER
INDONESIA SEEKS TO INCREASE SUGAR OUTPUT Indonesia will try to increase sugaroutput in calendar 1988 to 2.4 mln tonnes from an expected 2.2mln in 1987, Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi said.    He told reporters after meeting President Suharto the gainswill come from increasing average production to 10 tonnes perhectare from the previous 6.2 tonnes.    He said Indonesia is aiming to pass the United States tobecome the world's fourth largest producer compared with itscurrent seventh position.    Affandi said the increase would insure Indonesia'sself-sufficiency in the commodity and allow it to keep adequatestocks.    Indonesia said it produced 2.02 mln tonnes in 1986, but theU.S. Embassy in its annual agriculture report said output was1.8 mln tonnes. The U.S. Report forecast no change for 1987.    Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar late last yearand in early 1987 to boost low sugar stocks.    The country has around 284,000 hectares of sugar canefarms. The agriculture ministry estimates domestic consumptionat 2.03 mln tonnes in calendar 1987. REUTER
FIJI MAKES SUGAR PAYMENT TO GET HARVEST STARTED Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interimpayment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in amove aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 cropunder way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.    Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 cropindicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)crop year.    The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced486,790 tonnes.    For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayedharvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from theGovernor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.    Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would makea payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment forthe 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growersfor commencement of harvesting would be completed at all millsby June 23.    Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.    The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is thefull amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceedsreceived to-date. The balance will be paid in October.    Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery tothe mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlledFiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.    However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of theforecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all caneharvested by November 30, he said.    Ganilau said, "This will be at least one month in advance ofthe expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. Thebalance of the second payment will be made six weeks after theend of crushing."    Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that anestimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.The FDB rejected this request.    Ganilau said, however, "The bank is prepared to carefullyconsider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases ofhardship on a case-by-case basis."    In response to a further demand that all soldiers beremoved from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the armywould restrict its presence in the cane areas.    He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits toharvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unionsto hold the necessary meetings in preparation for thecommencement of harvest.    Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers hadindicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,he added. REUTER
FOUR SUGAR CARGOES SOLD TO CHINA YESTERDAY -TRADE Four cargoes of raw sugar were sold toChina yesterday via the London trade to supplement thecountry's current nearby buying programme, traders said.    The sugar was reported sold at around 160 dlrs a tonne cand f for July/August shipment or arrival in September, theysaid.    Some traders said recent Chinese purchases could total asmuch as 300,000 tonnes, but others, while agreeing a heavyvolume had been taken, said an amount less than that figure wasinvolved.

INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS Indonesia rejected World Bankrecommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, asthe country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarksdistributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations metat The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bankfor this free trade, open economy view is weak."    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages thelargest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agriculturalgrowth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peakedand the subsidies are a waste of money.    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and providesan income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies wereneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well asassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmersshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said thegovernment would continue to maintain production targets for"strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia'sdrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are doublethe world average because of inefficiencies, and the countrywould save money by importing the commodity.    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the needto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugarindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in theagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industrydevelop and because of "over-production and price interventionin the developed nations."

COLD, WET WEATHER SLOWS BEET GROWTH IN W. EUROPE Cold and wet weather in northern,western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beetgrowth but plant density is reported to be good in mostcountries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.    Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain hashampered field work and occasionally led to water-loggedfields.    But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather hasboosted sugar beet growth.    Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beetdevelopment, Licht said.    In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plantpopulation is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainyweather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects arerated as slightly below normal.    In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool withheavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.    In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, itwas mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall whichcontinued to slow down beet growth and often made field workimpossible.    In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which wasfavourable for beet growth, Licht said.    In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouringbeet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.    In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,it was warm with showers over most areas and weather wasgenerally good for the emergence and growth of beets.    In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfallboosted beet development.    Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputesbetween the factories and the trade unions are threatening todelay the start of processing in the southern areas, wherebeets are maturing very early this year. Reuter

U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES The United States is prepared to "pull outall the stops" to defend its agricultural trade rights under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassadorto GATT Michael Samuels said.    Those rights are now being challenged by the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told aconference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate ifthe EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef withoutthe issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effecton January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meatshipments into the EC.    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseedprices over the current market level and which may be extendedto include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral tradenegotiations, "is meaningless if import barriers continue to beerected," Samuels said.    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farmsubsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, "visionary"and "very serious."  The EC and Japan have said it isunrealistic.    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposalon farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formallynext week.    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reducetensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cerealssubstitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction offarm subsidies.    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long asthey are directly linked to long-term commitments to end majortrade distortions, Samuels said.    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formallysubmitted and respond to it officially then.    "We will consider its relation to the Punta del Estedeclaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,"the U.S. Ambassador said.    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignoresthe U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.    The key difference between the two approaches is that theU.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushingonly for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,there would be little incentive for the Community to work tocorrect the international trade situation, he added.    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the ECoilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports tothird countries as three crucial barriers to trade which theU.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

SOVIET SUGAR CONSUMPTION UP AS HOME BREWING GROWS A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumptionsince the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicateshome brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lostvodka sales, Pravda said.    The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales hadincreased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned intotwo billion bottles of moonshine.    At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said,this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached theequivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenuesfrom vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree.    "Official statistics show a reduction in consumption ofvodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not counthome-brew," Pravda said.    "The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now alsofirmly settled into cities, where the availability of naturalgas, running water and privacy has made it much easier."    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcoholcampaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a firststep to improving Soviet economic performance, which had beenseriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population.
