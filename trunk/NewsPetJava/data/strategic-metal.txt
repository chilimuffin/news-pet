EC OPENS ANTI-DUMPING ENQUIRY INTO SOVIET MERCURY The European Community Commission saidit has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Unionis dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices.    The Commission said its decision follows a complaint fromEC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Sovietmercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in theEuropean industry.    According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EChad risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes betweenAugust and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct ofthe EC market if they continue at the same pace.    The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them tocut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. Theimports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said.    The Commission said the industry would probably be unableto hold prices at current levels and that any increase wouldresult in loss of sales and jobs.    The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by theCommission will allow all interested parties to state theircases to the authority. REUTER
U.S. TREASURY PROPOSES SOME S. AFRICAN IMPORTS The Treasury proposed allowing temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uraniumoxide until July 1 under certain conditions pendingclarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress lastfall.    The proposal to be published in the Federal Register nextweek requests written congressional and public comment within60 days and deals with uranium ore and oxide that is importedfor U.S. processing and exporting to third countries.    The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporaryimports because it felt Congress had not intended when itpassed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall-- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.    "The domestic uranium conversion industry and the federalgovernment's enrichment industry could be seriously injured ina manner not intended by Congress if the . . . import ban onuranium ore and oxide were implemented to bar imports forprocessing and export through a mistaken interpretation of theact," the Treasury brief said.    The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore andoxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert theirSouth African origin ore and oxide to other countries includingthe Soviet Union for processing.    Treasury said it would allow imports of the South Africanore and oxide until July 1 for processing and re-export"provided that the imported ore or oxide is accompanies by alicense for importation issued by the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission."    The Treasury brief also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goodsto be imported temporarily from South African state-controlledorganizations for repair or servicing in the United States.    "The U.S. Customs will allow such importation to be madeunder bond," the brief said.    The South African sanctions law, enacted by the UnitedStates to protest the apartheid laws of racial segregationpracticed by South Africa's white minority government,prohibited imports of uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel,coal and textiles at the end of 1986.

ALGERIAN, SPANISH FIRMS AGREE QUICKSILVER PRICE Algerian and Spanish producers whichtogether meet 40 pct of the Western market's needs inquicksilver have agreed to apply a minimum selling price of 300dlrs per unit, the Algerian news agency APS said.    The agreement was made during a meeting here last weekbetween Algeria's Entreprise Nationale des Non-ferreux etSubstances Utiles (ENOF) and Spain's Almaden to discuss themarket situation.    The two firms "took note with regret that prices quoted bysome specialised publications do not reflect the reality of thewhole market since they take into account only part of thedeals made," a statement by ENOF said.    The result is that the prices quoted are far away from twofirms' production costs.    "They have thus decided that their selling price would notbe linked any more to the prices quoted by these publicationsand that sales would be made at a minimum price of 300 dlrs fobper jar, which is close to their production cost," the statementsaid.    It added that Turkish producers would join in when the twofirms meet again in Madrid later this month.    The price of quicksilver on the London Metal Exchangehovered around 200 dlrs this week.

DOE RECOMMENDS SPECIAL UNIT TO ENRICH URANIUM Energy Secretary John Herrington toldCongress that a federally chartered corporation would be thebest way to manage and operate the government's uraniumenrichment program.    He said in a letter to Congressmen that unless the program,now run by the Energy Department, is improved, sales worth fivebillion dlrs could be lost between 1990 and 2000.    The program now has annual commercial sales of about onebillion dlrs and holds 50 pct of the free world market forenrichment services.    A department official said the world market for enricheduranium for reactors for power utilities is increasinglycompetitive and private entity could better tap it.    The Administration's plan to spin off the department's uranium enrichment operation is in line with it effort toreduce the federal government's role in areas where it feelsprivate enterprise could be more efficient. reuter
HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE The House Armed Services Committeehas voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiledmaterials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.    The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity andquality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.    The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Billwhich will be voted on in the House next month.    The purpose of the measures, passed by the committeeyesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discouragesell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, astaff member of the committee told Reuters.    "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by beingmanaged properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpileover the last 10 years has been atrocious."    Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to aWhite House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.    The staffer said under the measures passed by the committeethe Secretary of Defense would have more influence overdecisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.    The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrsworth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. Thestockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to managethe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budgetand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.
