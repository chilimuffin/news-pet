NPPC DELEGATES APPROVE DISEASE AND DRUG PROGRAMS Delegates from the National PorkProducers Council, NPPC, yesterday approved programs forcontrol and eradication of pseudorabies and establishment of anational safe drug use program.    The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress inIndianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradicationprogram at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC'sPRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee.    The PRV committee received results of a three year, fivestate pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate ineradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The projectwas jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC.    "Primarily it (the program) allows individual states todeal with their own problems according to a timetable thatsuits them best," Mike Wehler, member of the NPPC's PRVoversight committee said.    In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a planasking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe druguse program.    The program would establish better relationships betweenproducers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a qualityassurance program in pork production, according to the plan.    "This program basically communicates to the FDA that we areconcerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugssafely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue ineffect," Wehler said.

LMFE TO CONCENTRATE ON CASH SETTLED CONTRACTS The London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE,will cease trading in its deliverable pigmeat contract fromApril 3, the LMFE said.    The move will enable the exchange to concentrate on thecash settled contracts introduced last year.    "This allows the exchange and its members to concentrate ourmarketing on the pig and live cattle contracts," LMFE officialPeter Freeman said. "These two have already shown theireffectiveness for hedging, and the trade in both contracts isincreasing," he added.    "Using the futures market allows better planning and forwardprice fixing that our industry needs," chairman Pat Elmer said.    Some 131 pig contracts were settled against the Meat andLivestock Commission's Average All Pigs Price in February,which represents hedging for over 13,000 pigs, more than twicethe number cash-settled in January, the LMFE said.    Cash settlement on the new cattle and pig contracts wasintroduced last June in the expectation that the appeal of thefutures market to farmers, abattoirs and users of meat wouldincrease because of the absence of a delivery requirement.

U.S. SENATORS SEEK TO EXPAND USDA EXPORT BONUS Leading U.S. farm state senators areseeking to insert into the Senate's omnibus trade bill aprovision that would broaden eligibility requirements under theU.S. Agriculture Department's export enhancement program, EEP,to include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, includingthe Soviet Union, Senate staff said.    Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies torecoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair tradingpractices.    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort tobroaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to beeligible for the subsidies, sources said.    The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee ChairmanLloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), David Pryor(D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) --also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield porkproducers and processors from Canadian imports.    The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa),would clarify the definition of "industry" in determining whetheror not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers.    Grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by theInternational Trade Commission that imports from Canada of liveswine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harmingU.S. producers.    The bill's proponents have argued Canada has simplyreplaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork. Reuter
INT'L MINERALS PROJECT TO BOOST HOG LEAN WEIGHT International Minerals andChemical Corp said its board approved a 50 mln dlrs budget overthe next several years to build production facilities for anewly developed product to be used to improve the lean weightof hogs.    The new product, porcine somatotropin (PST) is described asa natural bio-synthetic protein that improves the lean weightand rate of weight gain, as well as reduces the cost of feedfor market hogs, the company said.    Specific details of the PST production project, includingsites for proposed facilities and engineering plans, were notdisclosed. International Minerals said it set a completiontarget for the spring of 1989, by which time necessary Food andDrug Administration approvals are expected to be obtained. Reuter

It said unlike Factor VIII concentrates currently in use,genetically engineered Factor VIII would not be limited by theavailability of human plasma and will be completely free fromblood-borne viruses, including AIDS and all forms of hepatitis,Baxter said.    Baxter also said it is in the final states of U.S. clinicaltrials on a highly purified form of Factor VIII derived fromhuman plasma that is produced using an advanced processincorporating monoclonal antibody purification.    It said Genetics Institute, a publicly held biotechnologycompany in which Baxter is a shareholder, will supply theprotein used for human clinical testing, as well as asubstantial portion of ongoing production requirements.

HOG REPORT SHOWS MORE HOGS ON FARMS The USDA quarterly hogs and pig reportyesterday showed more hogs on U.S. farms compared to last yearas profitability resulting from low grain prices encouragedproducers to step up production, analysts said.    Most analysts seemed to agree with Chicago MercantileExchange floor traders that the report will be viewed asbearish to pork futures and futures prices may open sharplylower today. Some traders and analysts expect limit declines innearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.    University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,"Thereport shows that hog producers have responded to a verydesirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10months."    Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futuresprices are above producers' break even points. Even if futuresfell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could stilllock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavyselling pressure today.    "We have not had a period of profitability of thismagnitude since last summer," Levitt said. "In fact, hogoperations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have beenso profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get backon their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hogoperation alone."    Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also wasnegative, in that some lead time was anticipated before theslaughter increased from the previous year.    We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but wedidn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-statespring report, Levitt added.    High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn thatcould be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increasedprofits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations toincrease production starting late last year.    Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hogherd resulted from a revision of the December report andwithout the revision, the March report might have been veryclose to average expectations.    Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a majorupward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breedingherd in the December 1 report. So the December report was morebearish than initially indicated.    But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the reportto be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distantcontracts are already at a sharp discount to cash becausetraders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.    Discounts in the October and December contracts take intoconsideration a six to seven pct increase in March/Mayfarrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1report, Fuller said.    Grimes said, "As far as the distant months are concerned,if our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60lb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take atremendous discount in price for each percent increase for usto push down to the prices that the current futures show forthe July and August period."    Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted thatdistant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower thanthey were last summer.    "If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrsduring July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaperthis year because we have six pct more numbers," he said. Reuter

NPPC APPEAL ON CANADIAN PORK DISMISSED The U.S. Court of International Trade hasupheld the International Trade Commission's refusal to extendcountervailing duties on Canadian hogs to include porkproducts, the National Pork Producers' Council said.    The court's ruling came in an appeal to the TradeCommission's decision filed by the Pork Producers' Council.    Council president Tom Miller said he was disappointed bythe court ruling and said the council will accelerateactivities in support of an amendment to the 1930 Tariff Actthat would address the objections outlined in the TradeCommission's ruling.    The Commission had said there was insufficient economicintegration between the pork production industry and the porkpacking industry to justify extending the duty on live hogs tofresh, chilled or frozen pork.    The legislation has already passed the House ofRepresentatives and recently passed the Senate FinanceCommittee. It is expected to be considered by the full Senateby the end of the summer.    An appeal by the Canadian Pork Council that the currentcountervailing duty on Canadian hogs entering the U.S. belifted is pending before the Court. Reuter

CANADA THREATENS BAN ON DANISH PIGMEAT IMPORTS Canada has threatened to stop importsof Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinaryinspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danishagriculture ministry official told Reuters.    The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at therequest of the European Commission, which Denmark approachedfor support.    Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in aninterview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: "Denmark will notaccept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reachan understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC."    Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crownsin 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Communitytotalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.    Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicionthat the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by ECveterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.    But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen saidthe inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on ECregulations. "Canadian officials are very concerned about thetrade implications. We are holding active discussions with theEC and bilaterally," she added. REUTER
