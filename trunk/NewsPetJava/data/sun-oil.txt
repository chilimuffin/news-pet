SPANISH SUNOIL EXPORTERS SEEK SEED CLEARANCE Spanish exporters are asking thegovernment to clear 33,200 tonnes of sunflower seed authorisedfor export by the European Community (EC), a spokesman for oneof Spain's major sunflower oil producers said.    He told Reuters in a telephone interview the government washolding back on authorisation to hold prices low.    "They are deliberately keeping prices down to help meet thisyear's inflation target despite the threat of a surplus on whatlooks like a bigger harvest than we expected," he said.    He said the policy of allowing stocks to accumulate hadcaused a price drop, with raw oil prices falling to 147 pesetasa kilo from 160 at the start of the 1986/87 marketing yearending July 31.    Sunflower oil output was expected to rise to 370,000 tonnesthis year from 340,000 last year, with seed output up at905,000 tonnes from 860,000 last year.    He said domestic consumption was falling due to imports ofother edible oils. "We estimate demand at 296,000 tonnes thisyear, leaving a 124,000 tonne surplus with the 50,000 tonnesnow stockpiled," he said. "If we discount 24,000 tonnes held forstrategic purposes, this still leaves us with 100,000 tonnes." Reuter
GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE The rate of increase in world palm oiluse is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that inthe next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year averageincrease of 550,000 tonnes.     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expectedto be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlierlevels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnesabove this season's available amount, Mielke said.    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia willslow down from this year on, but that will be offset by areaexpansion in Indonesia, he said.    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesianmature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, andat 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,but where yields are lower, he said.     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is alsoexpected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel andpalm.    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils wereunusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the currentseason's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year agoand with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the startof next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks bythe end of next season.    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks lastOctober and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 atthe end of next season, Mielke said.    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in thecourse of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen insoybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mlntonnes or by one fifth.    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mlntonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocksof 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of thisseason.
