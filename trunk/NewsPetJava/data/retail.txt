FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN U.S. retailers posted stronger thanexpected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analyststo change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for thefirst half of 1987.     "My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of thebusiness we normally see later in the quarter and the realstrength of general merchandise sales will be in the secondhalf of 1987," said Bear Stearns and Co analyst MonroeGreenstein.    "I don't think March will be as strong because Easter fallsin April this year," said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb.   Analysts generally average the sales results of March andApril to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence.    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates saidsales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a3.6 pct increase last year.     Analysts noted that February is considered a small,transitory month between winter and spring.    In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by anespecially soft February last year which was adversely affectedby severe weather.    Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales,according to retailers and analysts.    "February's strong sales reflected a lot of freshmerchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due totax reductions," said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.    Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales ofdurable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuinghigh levels of consumer debt.     May Department Stores Co <MAY> and K Mart Corp <KM> wereamong the strong performers, posting comparable store salesgains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overallsales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain last month.    "Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programscontinued to positively impact our sales comparisons. INaddition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all ourspecialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,"said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.    Sears Roebuck and Co <S> posted a 4.9 pct increase."Domestic sales were led by better than average increases inapparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strongcatalog sales," said Sears chairman Edward Brennan.    Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc<JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early inthe month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitivestore basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales.    Penney chairman William Howell said, "store sales werestrongest during the early part of the month, while catalogdemand was consistently strong throughout the period.    Store sales activity varied throughout the country, rangingfrom good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest.    Analysts also said gross profit margins were high asretailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventoriesthan a year ago.    "February is not a big month seasonally but these numberssuggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending," said DrexelBurnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

U.S. RETAIL SALES ROSE 4.1 PCT IN FEB, NON-AUTO SALES ROSE An 18-month strike againstWatsonville Canning and Frozen Foods, one of California'slargest food processors, ended with workers overwhelminglyratifying a new contract.    More than 1,000 workers walked off their jobs in September1985 after Watsonville Canning cut their wages from 6.66 dlrsan hour to 4.85 dlrs.    Watsonville declared bankruptcy last week and the cannerywas taken over by Norcal Frozen Foods Inc., a consortium ofgrowers. A spokeswoman for Teamsters Local 912 said the workersvoted 543-21 in favor of a new contract.    The Norcal offer provides a 5.85 dlrs-per-hour wage with noadditional benefits for most workers for up to three years. Reuter
U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE 4.1 PCT IN FEBRUARY U.S. retail sales rose 4.77 billiondlrs, or 4.1 pct, in February to a seasonally adjusted 122.29billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.    The increase came after a revised 7.4 pct drop in Januarysales to a level of 117.52 billion dlrs. The departmentpreviously reported January retail sales fell 5.8 pct.    Excluding autos, retail sales in February were up 1.5 pctafter falling by a revised 0.4 pct in January.    Department spokesmen said the major cause for the revisiondownward in January sales was a weaker January auto dealersales figure than originally estimated.    Auto dealer sales were 26.91 billion dlrs in February, a14.4 pct rise from January levels. But January sales dropped by27.7 pct from December levels to 23.52 billion dlrs, more thanthe 22.4 pct fall originally reported.    The expiration of the sales tax deduction under new taxlaws on January 1 was the main reason for the drop in Januarysales, department spokesmen said.    Sales of durable goods rose in February by 8.8 pct to 46.72billion dlrs after dropping by 17.7 pct in January.    Building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after fallingby 1.7 pct in January.

U.K. RETAILERS SEE GROWTH IN CONSUMER SPENDING U.K. Retailers expect consumer spendingto accelerate in March after a disappointing increase inFebruary, according to a monthly survey by the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI).    Fifty-nine pct of the 325 retailers questioned for thelatest Distributive Trades Survey expected sales to be higherin March than they were in March 1986, with only six pctexpecting lower sales.    The chairman of the Distributive Trades Survey Panel, NigelWhittaker, said a favourable Budget next week would furtherhelp sales during the summer.    Figures released earlier this week showed retail sales inJanuary fell 2.2 pct, mainly due to exceptionally cold weather.    "Sales did not recover in February as much as retailers hadexpected, and they are now looking for better business inMarch," today's survey said.    It reported clothing stores were the most optimistic, with80 pct expecting sales in March to be higher than a year ago.    Wholesalers also expected stronger sales in March, whileboth retailers and wholesalers reported slower growth in importpenetration, it said. REUTER

U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND - ANALYSTS U.S. retail sales rose sharply inFebruary but many economists said the underlying consumerspending trend remains weak.    February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January'ssales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previouslyreported 5.8 pct decline.    "The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at amuch more sluggish pace," said Don Maude of Midland MontaguCapital Markets Inc.    Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales dataover past four months to show that the pace of consumerspending is slowing.    Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in Novemberand a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gainover the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4pct rise for year-over-year sales through February.    "You can see a pattern developing," Maude said. "I wouldn'tbe surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since salesprobably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were inFebruary."    Despite the weak underlying trend, economists wereimpressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excludingautos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct declinein January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline.    "The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gainsin durable goods as well as non-durables," noted Ward McCarthyof Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. "It was a pretty healthyreport."    He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in Februaryafter falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise storesales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January.    "There are signs of life in the economy," McCarthy said."But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this reportinto the future."     A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in Januarywhich may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boostspending in February, he said.    "A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholdingtaxes from their paychecks," he said. "When people in thiscountry get an increase in disposable income, the inclinationis to go out and spend it," he said.    Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales forthe first 10 days of March will be an important indicator ofhow much this sector will add to first quarter spending.     Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of totalFebruary sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct dropin January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largelyto the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax lawsJanuary 1, the Commerce Department noted.    Some economists argued that the because the gain in totalsales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, thestrength in the February report is less than impressive.    "There is strength in the February data, but that's becausethey were compared to low sales levels in January," said saidBeth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "We don't see it as aprecursor of continued strength."    Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January.    Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higheroil prices rather than an increased volume of gas salesprobably accounted for these gains.    Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spendingis weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billiondlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, theyfell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and inFebruary rose to 122.29 billion dlrs.    "On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mlndlrs in the first quartrer," she said. "We don't look at thisas indication that the economy is barrelling along."    "The number is not really that problematic for those of uswho are constructive on the bond market," agreed Elliot Plattof Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.    Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetarypolicy on the basis of the latest retail sales report.    "The Fed is on hold now because the data have been soconfusing," he said.    "Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payrollemployment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut inMarch," he said. "But now Fed officials will have to wait forthe first quarter real U.S. gross national product data inApril to sort things out." Reuter

UK FEB RETAIL SALES RISE PROVISIONAL 2.2 PCT (JAN FALL 2.2 PCT) -  Gold is expected to continue its risethis year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially inthe U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.    It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oilprices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries'efforts to achieve further firming of the price led to growinginflationary pressures in the U.S., The world's biggest crudeoil producer.    Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceedthe central banks' limits and real growth of their grossnational products, it said.    Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increasedindustrial demand and higher expected coin production, the banksaid.    Speculative demand, which influences the gold price onfutures markets, has also risen. These factors and SouthAfrica's unstable political situation, which may lead to atemporary reduction in gold supplies from that country,underline the firmer sentiment, it said.    However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986. REUTER

U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER U.S. retailers' lackluster March saleswere due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect arecovery in April.    "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, butunderlying business is better than the numbers indicate," saidBear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.     Analysts generally average the sales results of March andApril to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. Thisyear, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is threeweeks later than last year.    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates saidsales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and aseasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted5.7 pct last year.    "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicatethat the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appearto be because liquidity and employment are rising," saidanalyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming inaccording to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expectedto rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticketitems were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to manyanalysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as theholiday nears.    "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect acontinuing strength in the housing market," said EdwardBrennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co <S> which reported anoverall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women'ssportswear were also excellent.    "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but evena modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishmentdue to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner.     J.C. Penney Co Inc <JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp <DH> wereamong the weaker performers with comparable stores salesdeclining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store andcatalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson'soverall sales rose 4.8 pct.    Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continuedstrong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged fromvery active in the east to weak in the economically depressedsouthwest."    "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activitywear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,but are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of BearStearns.    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter forthe decline. Edelman of Drexel said that "Hudson had a toughercomparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."    Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lowerthan last year.    "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories arebeing kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but salesare coming through anyway," said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.
