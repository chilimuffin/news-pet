TRACOMIN SEES LOWER U.S. EDIBLE GROUNDNUT EXPORTS U.S. Exports of ediblegroundnuts could fall to 185,000 tonnes in the year toSeptember 1987 from 248,000 in the same 1986 period, tradingcompany Tracomin SA said.    It revised its December 1986 forecast that exports wouldtotal 205,000 tonnes, citing low demand, the loss of U.S.Market share in the two main importing countries, Britain andthe Netherlands, and the sale of nuts intended for export at apremium in the U.S. Domestic market.    Tracomin estimated export availability from the 1986 cropat 215,000 tonnes compared with 264,000 the previous year.    Tracomin said it expects a good 1987 U.S. Groundnut cropand forecast a resurgence in U.S. Exports next year.    "Barring any market manipulations, a good U.S. Harvest in1987 could lead to attractive prices, active trading and thereappearance of the U.S.A as the world's leading producer ofpeanuts," it said.    Overall exports from China, the leading exporter last year,will remain at exceptionally high levels this year despitequality complaints and difficulties in implementing someearlier high-priced contracts. It is too early to say if Chinacan retain its current market share in 1988, Tracomin said. REUTER
