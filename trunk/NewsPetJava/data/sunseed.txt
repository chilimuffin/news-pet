TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST Torrential rains throughoutArgentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarsegrain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.    Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularlyaffected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid tosoybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April orMay.    The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghumcrops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yieldsand cut the total volume of this year's harvest.    Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.    No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.    Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume ofthe coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.    Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central SantaFe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct oftotal planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.    Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest wasestimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two toseven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the1985/86 harvest.    Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according toofficial figures.    The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and ninepct of total planted area.    Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowersfor this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figureof 3.14 mln hectares.    Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mlnand 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the1985/86 harvest.    Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two andfour pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mlnhectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.    Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.    Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit arecord 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figuresput last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.    Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very goodcondition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.    Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest isexpected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares. Reuter
MORE HEAVY RAINS IN ARGENTINE GRAIN AREAS Heavy rains fell again inArgentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday,trade sources said.    Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularlyhigh volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa andSanta Fe provinces.    Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires,heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in LaPampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe.Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.    Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mmin Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm inChaco.    Growers said it was still too early to tell whether therains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflowercrops may have suffered.    Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed bythe bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rainswould have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allowfarm machinery to operate.    The rains caused flooding in western and northwesternBuenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areasthere since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.    Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares,Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said afterflying over the flooded area.    Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said largeparts of the flooded areas were not planted because they arelow-lying and flood easily.    Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by theheavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent ofthe damage. They said it was likely rain combined with highwinds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.    The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and southof Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolatedareas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pcta week ago.    Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop wererevised downward in light of the bad weather.    Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes,down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mlntonnes.    Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a weekago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated aweek ago.    Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes,according to official figures.    Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mlntonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mlntonnes, according to official figures.    Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching betweenfour and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to fourpct a week ago.    Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnesproduced in the last harvest. Reuter
RISE SEEN IN FRENCH RAPESEED, SOYBEAN SOWINGS France's Oilseed and Bean CooperativesFederation, FFCOP, said it expected French rapeseed sowings forthe 1987 harvest to rise by between 54.6 pct and 67.5 pct tobetween 600,000 and 650,000 hectares from 388,000 planted lastyear.    Its latest estimates also suggested a 66.7 pct rise insoybean sowings to 80,000 ha from 48,000 last year. Sunflowersowings were expected to increase by between 8.6 pct and 14.6pct from 829,000 ha. Pea sowings are estimated likely to rise27.7 pct to 350,000 ha against 274,000, while field beansowings are forecast unchanged at 40,000. REUTER
ARGENTINE MAIZE, SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL Argentine grain growers reducedtheir estimates for maize and soybean production in the currentharvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.    Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reachbetween 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnesestimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated inmid-February.    But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, accordingto official figures, and would be a new record.    The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was arecord 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pctcompared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.    The change in yield estimates is due to very hightemperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year inthe soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe andnorthern Buenos Aires province.    The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybeanpods empty, especially in Cordoba.    Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, sincerainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.    Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak inBuenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. Therewas no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields wereable to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recentweeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,sunflower and sorghum harvesting.    Crops were considered in generally good condition, thoughit is still too early to judge whether the intense rains ofrecent weeks caused any long-term damage.    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of thetotal area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.    Total production for the current maize harvest is expectedto reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mlntonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pctlower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,according to official figures.    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct oftotal planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was twoto 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.    The current harvest's volume was again expected to bebetween 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower thanlast harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers fearedthat heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll oncrops and, consequently, on total production volume.    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct oftotal planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mlnhectares planted in the previous harvest.    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvestremained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mlntonnes. Reuter
ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER Argentine grain producers againreduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April,trade sources said.    They said growers now forecast soybean production thisseason at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week'sestimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mlntonnes forecast in mid-February.    The new forecast is still higher than last season's recordtotal production.    Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecastfor the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.    Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean podsin the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Feprovinces and northern Buenos Aires.    The crop since January has been hit by high temperaturesand inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more emptypods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86record of 3.34 mln hectares.    The state of the crop continued to be good in general untillast week but intense, heavy rains since could have causeddamage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.    Where the rains were less heavy they were consideredbeneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops insouthern Buenos Aires province but are not expected toinfluence production forecasts.    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, whererainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maizeand sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week byrains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, LaPampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mlnhectares in 1985/86.    The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast atbetween 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 productionand 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of thearea sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Airesalthough at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage isimpossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days ofsunshine dries the fields.    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.    Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln tonnes.    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by therains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and startingin La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes. Reuter

FRENCH FARMERS PLAN TO CUT MAIZE PLANTINGS French farmers are planning to cut theirmaize sowings by between 100,000 and 150,000 hectares this yearfrom the 1.87 mln ha harvested in 1986, the French MaizeProducers' Association, AGPM, said.    It said its first estimate of planting intentions indicatedcuts of 15 to 20 pct in plantings in the northern region ofPicardy and the Paris Basin, which harvested 192,000 ha lastyear.    In the centre-west region of Poitou-Charentes, plantingswere estimated four to seven pct up on last year's harvested244,000 ha.    Planting intentions in the south-east ranged between ninepct less and two pct more than last year's 125,000 ha. In thesouth-west the AGPM said producers intended to plant a similararea to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided watersupplies are adequate in the Midi-Pyrenees region after thelast two years of drought.    Meanwhile, the oilseed plant breeding association, AMSOL,said sunflower plantings in France this year are indicated atbetween 900,000 and 950,000 ha against 829,000 harvested lastyear, while soya plantings are indicated at 80,000 ha againstlast year's harvested 48,000.

HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP Fresh, heavy rains caused furtherdamage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the weekto yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, tradesources said.    They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum cropswere damaged and yield estimates affected. New productionforecasts were made for all these crops.    The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registeredmore than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires andworsened the flooding in various parts of the province.    The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aireshave surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.    The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.    In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres areabordering on Uruguay.    In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mmin places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.    The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.    Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also befurther delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.    The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of thecrops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.    Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa andBuenos Aires provinces.    The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has beenlowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lowerthan the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.    The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.    The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of thearea sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Itwill begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weatherpermitting.    Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mlntonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which privateproducers put 1985/86 production.    The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the officialfigure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production.    The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers'targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.    The production forecast was reduced to between three and3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.    The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mlnhectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.    The forecast for soybean yield this season was the leastchanged in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.    These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season'srecord of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources,and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.    The adjustment to the production forecast is due to therains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced thesunlight needed for this crop, sources said.    Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted downfurther.    The humidity could induce rotting and growers are stillfinding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlierin the season.    Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southernCordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Reuter
FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.

SPANISH SUNOIL EXPORTERS SEEK SEED CLEARANCE Spanish exporters are asking thegovernment to clear 33,200 tonnes of sunflower seed authorisedfor export by the European Community (EC), a spokesman for oneof Spain's major sunflower oil producers said.    He told Reuters in a telephone interview the government washolding back on authorisation to hold prices low.    "They are deliberately keeping prices down to help meet thisyear's inflation target despite the threat of a surplus on whatlooks like a bigger harvest than we expected," he said.    He said the policy of allowing stocks to accumulate hadcaused a price drop, with raw oil prices falling to 147 pesetasa kilo from 160 at the start of the 1986/87 marketing yearending July 31.    Sunflower oil output was expected to rise to 370,000 tonnesthis year from 340,000 last year, with seed output up at905,000 tonnes from 860,000 last year.    He said domestic consumption was falling due to imports ofother edible oils. "We estimate demand at 296,000 tonnes thisyear, leaving a 124,000 tonne surplus with the 50,000 tonnesnow stockpiled," he said. "If we discount 24,000 tonnes held forstrategic purposes, this still leaves us with 100,000 tonnes." Reuter
STALEY <STA> SELLS INTEREST IN SPANISH VENTURE Staley Continental Incsaid it sold its 50 interest in Sociedad Iberica deMolturacion, S.A. (Simsa), a soybean and sunflower seedprocessing company based in Madrid, Spain.

Staley said the Simsa transaction will not have a materialeffect on its balance sheet. Reuter
OILMEAL DEMAND STILL STRONG IN U.S., SOVIET UNION Oilmeal demand remained strong in theUnited States in July and August and six pct up on levels seenin the same months last year, with most of the rise coming insoymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose toa record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pcton the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal atseven pct, it said.    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago monthsfollowing a huge increase in soymeal imports.    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediatelybut went into stocks. With imports again large in September, itestimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes byOctober 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a yearearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due tobumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposalswere reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mlnat that time last year.
