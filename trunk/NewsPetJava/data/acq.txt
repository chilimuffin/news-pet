CHEMLAWN <CHEM> RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS ChemLawn Corp <CHEM> could attract ahigher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by WasteManagement Inc <WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 inover-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.    "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competingbidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,announced before the opening today, expires March 25.    "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, aChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularlyscheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Managementannouncement. She said a statement was expected but it was notcertain when it would be ready.     She was unable to say if there had been any prior contactbetween Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.    "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang,analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company thatdoesn't like a surprise attack would."    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tenderoffers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawncould try to find a white knight if does not want to beacquired by Waste Management.    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder saidServiceMaster Companies L.P. <SVM> or Rollins Inc <ROL> wereexamples of companies that could be interested.    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides andherbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal ofwastes.    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable toanother company that wants to capitalize on a strongresidential and commercial distribution system.    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates hadcatapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 butthe stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in thefourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share forthe full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands ofindividual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice. Reuter

AMERICAN EXPRESS <AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF American Express Co remained silent onmarket rumors it would spinoff all or part of its ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may beconsidering such a move because it is unhappy with the marketvalue of its stock.    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as themarket calculated a partially public Shearson may command agood market value, thereby boosting the total value of AmericanExpress. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financialservices firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.    American Express would not comment on the rumors or itsstock activity.    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcementyesterday of management changes.    At the meeting, company officials said American Expressstock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performanceof Shearson, according to analysts.    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chiefoperating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position ofpresident, which had been vacant. It also created four newpositions for chairmen of its operating divisions.    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make mostsense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a totalspinoff.    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff ofShearson would be good since it is a strong profit center forAmerican Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings lastyear.    "I think it is highly unlikely that American Express isgoing to sell shearson," said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.He questioned what would be a better investment than "a veryprofitable securities firm."    Several analysts said American Express is not in need ofcash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strongasset.    But others believe the company could very well ofconsidered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and onerumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said hebelieves American Express could have considered a partialspinoff in the past.    "Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched abig premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is inthe 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place wouldprobably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of marketcapitalization," said Eckenfelder.    Some analysts said American Express could use capital sinceit plans to expand globally.    "They have enormous internal growth plans that takescapital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations toenhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down theroad," said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.    "They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavilyin the future, which goes heavily into the internationalarena," said Lewis. "...That does not preclude acquisitions anddivestitures along the way," he said.    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to thebrokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock mightbetter reflect other assets, such as the travel relatedservices business.    "It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposureto brokerage. The value of the other components could command ahigher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage ofthe total operating earnings of the company," he said.     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-taxoperating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.    Reuter

WALLENBERGS FIGHT BID FOR SWEDISH MATCH STAKE Sweden's Wallenberg group fought backa bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser tosecure a large stake in Swedish Match <SMBS ST>, one of thecompanies at the core of their business empire.    A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies ABInvestor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had takenover an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.    Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier <NOBL ST>, in whichPenser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the marketprice for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.    Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased votingrights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 forthe free shares.    The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capitalwhile Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rightsand 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.    The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previouslyamounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.    The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the mostexpensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four yearsto defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.    The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an armsand chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo<VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco<ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs <SKPS ST>.    Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largestshareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB <SKBS ST> andFrederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.    Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, alsomanaged to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenbergcompany, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB <ALFS ST>.    During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating onbuilding up their stake in Investor and Providentia to preventany raid on the heart of their business empire.    But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in theelectrical engineering firm ASEA AB <ASEA ST> is also too smallat 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growingspeculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringeinterests to protect its core activities.

AMERICAN EXPRESS <AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS American Express Co, rumored to beconsidering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unitthat could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meetbroadening international competition.    In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson saidthe actions under consideration are an integral part ofAmerican Express' worldwide financial services strategy andthat the two companies have been having both internal andexternal discussions on the matters.    American Express said no decision has been reached on thestrategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimatelydecide to follow growth plans already in place.    Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that thefinancial services giant was considering a spinoff of part ofShearson and there was speculation it may be consideringselling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said thespeculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct ofthe profitable brokerage firm to the public.    There was some speculation that American Express had alsoconsidered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan wasconsidered highly unlikely, analysts said.     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that itwill not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesmanwould not go beyond the statement. The company also remainedsilent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove AmericanExpress stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring itto a Friday close at 74.     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because asimilar statement was being circulated to employees.    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense forAmerican Express to give up a stake in the wholly-ownedbrokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50pct in the last year.    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinningoff part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stockprice does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.    American Express' ambitious plans for international growthmay be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out partof Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all ofShearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling."(American) Express is in a position where they can raisecapital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder ofPrudential-Bache Securities.    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization ofShearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer JeffreyLane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.     The reorganization also created four new positions forchairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analystsspeculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement doeslittle to clarify last week's market speculation. It doesconfirm, however, that the financial services firm, whichunsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a majoracquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls forgrowth and positioning in the global market competition.    Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts saidthere had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed whenit approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

PUROLATOR <PCC> IN BUYOUT WITH HUTTON <EFH> New Jersey-based overnight messengerPurolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired forabout 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Incand certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.    Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale forsome time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling atakeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was fromanother courier company.    Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton GroupInc, will be majority owner of the company.    Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, ispaying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stockin a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shareswill be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in asubsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.courier operations.    If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholderswould receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs indebentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PCAcquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.    Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mlndlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PCAcquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock ofthe PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valuedthe warrants at two to three dlrs per share.    Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.    This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreedrecently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.    Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closurecaps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said thefirm is reviewing its options on Stant.    Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of itsU.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the pastseveral years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.    E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds tocomplete the transaction. This so-called "bridge" financingwill be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in theform of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed tokeeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.    "Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two yearslargely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe themanagement is turning around. We belive it will be a veryserious competitor in the future," said Idsal.    William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courierdivision, will be chief executive officer of the new company.    The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of twothirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn tothe expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.

CONSOLIDATED TVX SAYS IT WILL ISSUE SHARES TO BUY STAKES IN THREE BRAZIL MINI Brazil is not happy with the existingstructure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinatesits commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.    U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committeewhile holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said,adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks."The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,however.    Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese andEuropean banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adoptan approach involving separate discussions with the regions.    Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on acase-by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply tocreditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said.    Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interestpayments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followedlast week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines depositedby foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.    Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week inWashington talking to government officials and internationalagencies and will this week visit Britain, France, WestGermany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions withgovernments.    Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe andGovernor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.    Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K.The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan.    The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chiefmeans of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharplyand the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in thecountry'sate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to havedropped below four billion dlrs.    Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problemswith Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve onlypartial servicing of the debt.    "What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinancefor part of the service, because we cannot service all that," hesaid. "I really think we have to change the old rules."    Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, ratherthan the commercial banks themselves in its search for asolution to the crisis, Funaro said "We must first talk to thegovernments and then we can talk to the banks, because thebanks have some limits."    "It is a political discussion from our point of view," hesaid.    Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk toJapanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talkto the commercial banks "If I've got some solution from thegovernments. I can't take the burden only to the banks." He wasnot sure how long it would take to reach a solution.   In discussions with governments Brazil would review themechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations inneed. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtuallyclosed since 1982. "You must open these mechanisms," he said.    He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed byBrazil's suspension of interest payments, they understoodBrazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves.    Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed "becausewe can't stay as we were the last few years."    "I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of uswould like to have a kind of equilibrium." he said. AlthoughBrazil has rejected a substantive role for the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy, Funaro paid a callin Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and toWorld Bank President Barber Conable.    Funaro noted that inflation in February had started todecline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eightbillion dlr trade surplus in 1987.    Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus haddeclined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of lastyear, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months.    Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world,Funaro said, although its share of international trade was onlyone pct.  "The solution is linked with growth, not recession," hesaid, noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports andinducing an internal recession in order to service debt.    Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments,as opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounderstructure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Clubof creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt.

REDSTONE DETAILS SWEETENED VIACOM <VIA> OFFER Investor Sumner Redstone, who leadsone of the two groups vying for control of Viacom InternationalInc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs ashare cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National AmusementsInc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cashportion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.    Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stockhe is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.    The Redstone offer, which is being made through ArsenalHoldings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for thatpurpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of ashare of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.    Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bidsfrom Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacommanagement which is competing with Redstone for control of thecompany and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.    The company did not disclose the details of the revisedoffers, but said a special committee of its board would reviewthem later today.    The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have bothagreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger iscompleted, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer forat least half of the outstanding stock.

TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL <VIA> A bidding war for Viacom InternationalInc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted amanagement group and other investors against NationalAmusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.    Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A sourceclose to the management side insisted that timing was on hisside. He said if outside directors approve the managementproposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholderswith proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20days from the day we mail," said the source.    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled byinvestor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to completea tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that mustaccompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licensesand cable television franchises.    Redstone was not available for comment.    Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a raresituation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. Onesaid Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted andif enough people were convinced his proposal was superior tothe Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.    The independent directors of Viacom were called into ameeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. Onemajor Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We thinkwe're at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm'sarbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.    Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal wouldcreate a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. Themanagement plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferredstock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.    Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with avalue of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stockstock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equityinterest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculatedthe equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making thetotal package worth 52 dlrs per share.    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeablepreferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share ofconvertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portionwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.    Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest hewould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyondApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. Theplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pctduring May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offeredeight pct interest.    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the managementgroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own thecompany," one said. Another said management seemed to have theedge on the timing issue.    Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine whatthe equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. Henoted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp <FMC>, whichadopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititallytraded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is nowjust over 30 dlrs.    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell twotwo cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costsfrom several acquisitions affected results.    Shares of Warner Communications Inc <WCI> rose 7/8 to31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at37.50 dlrs.

PESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI <AMI> BID Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said hehas had discussions with several American Medical InternationalInc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of thecompany.    Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlrtakeover bid for American Medical with several largeshareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass familyof Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated supportone way or the other for his offer, he said.    Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on theconversations he held with shareholders, he could not guagewhether he had majority support. He said, however, there issupport for his offer.    Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he helddiscussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc,the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medicalstock.    Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medicalmanagement and other American Medical shareholders.    Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, said it believes a restructuring of AmericanMedical and its business would be "highly desirable andappropriate at this time."    "That's the sort of position that I find a large segment ofshareholders of AMI really share," said Pesch.    Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining histakeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, fourdlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for eachAmerican Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join inan effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would notrule out a future takeover try.    Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposalwith the Bass family.    Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch'stakeover effort and a further sign that there could be someshareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical'sprevious rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer fromPesch.    American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid.Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said amanagement-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.    An American Medical spokesman said the company will commenton the new Pesch offer by March 10.    Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor inthe outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.    The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in AmericanMedical, and the company has previously said the investorssupport management's internal plan to improve the company'sperformance. The Bass family would not comment on AmericanMedical or Pesch.    Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corplast year, continues to face a credibilty problem on WallStreet because of the long time it took to finish the Republicacquisition.    Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wallstreet questioning whether financing can be completed for themuch larger American Medical takeover proposal.    Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made withoutan investment banking firm, another cause for concern to WallStreet. However, Pesch entered his second offer withrepresentation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securitiesand Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.    "I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can beworked out and completed, provided we get to the point whereAmi management will sit down and talk in a friendlyenvironment," Pesch said.    Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financingarrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds inacquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of AmericanMedical management in place.    He said he plans to combine the company with Republic toform an efficient network of hospitals.    Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer couldbe made for American Medical.    Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved secondfiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worthabout 20 dlrs per share.    Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the secondquarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ctloss last year.    Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much morethan the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.    But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transactioncould be completed because of the revised structure of theoffer. "I think it's much more doable," he said.    Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaroundby replacing some members of management and reducing costs. Reuter

ANALYSTS SEE NO OTHER BIDDER FOR PUROLATOR<PCC> Several analysts said they do notbelieve another suitor will top the 265 mln dlr bid forPurolator Courier Corp by E.F.

There had been speculation another offer might beforthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per shareprice being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Incis fully valued.    Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubtedanother bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for salefor sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.    Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. Ithad been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer onFriday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the companymight fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.    analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitiveoffer would emerge since the company has been for sale forsometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.    Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon,Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.    Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of theshares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock ina subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S.courier operation.

SEC PROBES 1986 TRE <TRE> TAKEOVER ATTEMPT The federal Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC) is looking for possible securities lawsviolations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid byHollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp,attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.    During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's GiantGroup Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.    It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a LosAngeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on aportion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.    In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mlndlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham LambertInc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of theproceeds to buy TRE stock.    Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly sixpct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.    The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SECwas investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TREholdings were working together without disclosing theircooperation, as would be required by the federal securitieslaws.    One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whetherSugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of itsintended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mlndlr bond offering.    A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unitof Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SECinvestigators and was cooperating with the probe.    The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler hadbeen interviewed by the SEC probers.    A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked forinformation a few months ago as part of an informal probe.    The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agencyand had heard nothing more since that time.    "To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the targetof a formal SEC investigation" in connection with the TRE bid,he said.    A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm hadunderwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added:    "We had nothing to do with TRE."    As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines tocomment on its enforcement activities. Reuter

HK HOTELS SOARS ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION The price of Hongkong and ShanghaiHotels Ltd <SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of atakeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie familyand the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd <EVGH.HK> group, stockbrokers said.    They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after anannouncement by Evergo's <China Entertainment and LandInvestment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of HkHotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.    Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined commenton whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels.But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake boughtfrom Liang as long term investment.    He said Evergo "was attracted by the underlying strength ofHk Hotels."    Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possibleredevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best knownhotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned byHk Hotels.    <Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.

Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated tothe Hk Hotels board.    A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family hasnot considered any countermoves so far.    Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and theKadoorie family to cooperate because of different managementstyles.    "Evergo may want to split up the hotel management andproperty developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may notfit the conservative Kadoorie family," said an analyst who askednot to be named.    Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had beendistorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value isonly worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and LaiSun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below thecurrent trading price.

VIACOM <VIA> MERGER EXPECTED IN 60 TO 90 DAYS Sumner Redstone, president of NationalAmusements, Inc, predicted he can win regulatory approvals towrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom InternationalInc in 60 to 90 days.    Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues ofentertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers andtheir financial backers decided not to top National's bid.    "We've had counsel working for some time in every regionwhere Viacom has cable televison systems" Redstone told Reutersin a telephone interview.    Redstone also said "Viacom is committed to working veryclosely with us to obtain approvals." Viacom has been seekingapprovals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cablesystems since September when its management group firstadvanced a buyout plan.    But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited biddingcontest which was capped by the announcement this morning thatViacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered intoa defintive merger agreement with National.    National is a family business which operates a chain ofmovie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom.    Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on throughthe night but also excited at the prospect of running a leadingelectronic media company. He noted that the number of motionpicture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.    Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom,four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone saidexclusive contracts with pay television networks are theemerging trend. "Up until recently you could see any motionpicture on any pay channel," Redstone said.    He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studiosand plans to sign a deal with a third company next month.    Redstone said the management group's investment bankerswill be paid what is due for termination of its mergeragreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. "That willbe a company expense," Redstone said.    He said BankAmerica <BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiriesfrom lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlrfinancing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs.    After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of Nationalbut 17 pct of the company will be in public hands. Reuter

TWA <TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT <PIE> SITUATION Trans World Airlines Inc complicatedthe bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buyPiedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge withPiedmont and USAir.    Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Streetspeculated the board was discussing opposing bids from NorfolkSouthern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortlyafter the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. Italso said it was the largest shareholder of USAir andthreatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offerfor 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal forUSAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it saidit alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of theairlines.    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairmanCarl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline intothe takeover arena.    "We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWAinto play. There's speculation on the street he just wants tomove onto somthing else," said one arbitrager. "We think TWAmight just be putting up a trial balloon."    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,but that the airline will probably reject it because the priceis relatively low compared to other airline deals.    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible byrevealing financing arrangements. "They need to show theircommitment and their ability to finance. I think it's acredible offer," said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.    "I think it's certainly on the low end of relative valuesof airline deals," said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs wouldbe in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. Aspokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had notchanged its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct ofthat airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balancefor 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mlnshares.    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, alsoremained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck withits offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmontand opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeoverof Piedmont.    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir tomake his own airline a more attractive takeover target.    "Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and therewere no takers. I think the strategy might have called formaking his investment more attractive. One way to accomplishthat specific objective is to go out and acquire otherairlines," said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.    "I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least thisway it becomes a much more viable package," said Kim.    But Icahn's financing ability for such a transactionremains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to dothe offer.    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financialadvisers and plans to make his own arrangements.   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp <X>and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.    Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan wasimpacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWAoffer on price and financing concerns. "It's littered withcontingencies and it doesn't even have a financingarrangement," said one executive at another major airline.    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be astrong contender with USAir's east coast route system andplanned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed theintenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence inits St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,to the mix would develop an even stronger force.    The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservationsystem.    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it wouldresult in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.    Reuter

BAKER INTERNATIONAL CORP SUES HUGHES TOOL SEEKING MERGER CO OPEC crude oil output in the first fewdays of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpdceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.    The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oiltraders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the MiddleEast, Africa, Latin America and Asia.    They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that thegroup is producing within its ceiling to support the return toa fixed price system, which came into effect last month.    OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpdabove the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by theUnited Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.    The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,was also producing above quota in the first days of March, thesurvey reveals.    But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fallin Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability toexport as much as its quota allows.    Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.    Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.    Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, wasestimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 inearly March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its shareof Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.    Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by someOPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,both substantially under quota in February and early March.    Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.    Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"sprices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for anyshortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.    Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, downfrom 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.    Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonnygrades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudesfrom the U.K. North Sea.

BAKER <BKO> SUES TO FORCE HUGHES <HT> MERGER Baker International corp said it hasfiled suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Coto complete its proposed merger with Baker.    Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the mergeragreement because Baker would not agree to an alternativedivestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board hadpreviously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consentdecree that would have required broader divestitures.    Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanationfrom Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the JusticeDepartment consent decree.    Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at whichshareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting thecounting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the votewas overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.    Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for themerger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were "moreburdensome" than those of the consent decree themselves.    Baker said divestitures under the consent decree wouldreduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrsor three pct.    Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures ofthe units named in the consent decree.    It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain ofits directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes tolive up to the merger agreement or "substantial" monetarydamages it did not name.    Baker said it believes the merger to be in the bestinterests of shareholders of both companies. Reuter
USAIR <U> REJECTS TWA <TWA> TAKEOVER BID USAir Group Inc said its board hasrejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in thebest interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers.    The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C.Icahn-led TWA was "highly conditional."    USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc<PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer toacquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share andremaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued atabout 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price ofUSAir common during a period just before the merger.    The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont onarriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companieshope to reach one very shortly.    USAir said "In light of the highly conditional nature andother terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and thecircumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believesthat the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAirGroup's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.    "TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by CarlIcahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisitionof Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views asmost beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees andpassengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary tohis own personal interests."    USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore allappropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA'slast-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisitionof Piedmont.    The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWAobtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rightsissued to shareholders last year and acting to render the "fairprice" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable tothe TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

TRANSPORTATION AGENCY GIVES FINAL OKAY FOR US AIR PACIFIC SOUTHWEST ACQ Officials and diplomats said EC farmministers, who earlier this week ended another marathonnegotiating session, achieved more than ever before in thefight to end food surpluses, and delighted EC officials are nowpreparing to carry the reform offensive into other areas.    Their immediate aim is to drain the wine and olive oil"lakes" and level the "grain mountain" that have brought theCommunity so much unwelcome publicity.    Earlier this week, ministers finally agreed after 36 hoursof negotiations the fine details of an outline accord to cutmilk output by 9.5 pct over two years and reduce butter stocks,now at a record 1.2 mln tonnes.    Officials said new rules, which place strict limits onfarmers' rights to benefit from high subsidised prices, couldbe expected to reduce sales into intervention to a trickle andpave the way for reform in other surplus sectors.    The deal was reached despite determined attempts atbacksliding by some states as the implications of the originaloutline accord reached last December began to sink in.    "Despite coming under tremendous pressure, the ministersnever wavered from the main features of the deal," one seniorofficial said, adding the result augured well for talks laterthis month on other reforms.    The Commission is leading the fight against food surplusesand has now proposed the most severe annual price review, atwhich ministers fix farm support prices, in the EC's history.    Most prices would be cut or frozen, new quality standardsenforced, and most farmers' rights to sell to interventioncurtailed. Officials say the measures could lead to effectiveprice cuts for some low quality cereals of eight to 11 pct.    EC Commissioner Frans Andriessen is currently working onproposals to provide direct income aids to farmers to cushionthem from the worst effects of a restrictive price policy andencourage ministers to swallow the reform pill.

SHAD SEES PROGRESS ON INSIDER TRADING Securities and Exchange Commissionchairman John Shad said progress was being made in stoppinginsider trading, but the chairman of a House subcommittee withjurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned aboutconditions on Wall Street.    "Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and inthe process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporationshave become easy prey," Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, thechairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at thestart of a hearing on SEC activities.    "Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive thecurrent scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,"Markey said. "The frenzy and disruption created by merger maniais particularly distressing."    Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, DennisLevine and others was a warning that those who engage ininsider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, highfines and disbarment from the securities industry.    "Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has beeninhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boeskyand others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowingthrough to legitimate investors and traders," Shad said in hisstatement.    Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct orless of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they haveincreased significantly to 125 cases brought during the pastfive years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.    Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thoughtthe tender offer process needed reform including earlierdisclosure of takeover attempts.    N.J. Rep.

HUGHES TOOL <HT> SAYS BAKER <BKO> MERGER ALIVE Hughes Tool Co Chairman W.A. Kistlersaid its counter proposal to merge with Baker InternationalCorp was still under consideration and that a merger was in thebest interests of both companies.    "Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that isgood for both companies," Kistler said of the proposed mergerthat would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field servicecompany. "We're working very hard on this merger."    Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meetingto vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal.    The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concernabout a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that wouldrequire Baker to sell its drilling bit operations andsubmersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened toterminate the proposed merger.    The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the twocompanies first find acceptable buyers for the businessesbefore signing the decree.    The directors of Baker immediately after receiving thecounter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas statecourt to force to Hughes to complete the merger.    "The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that mightbe imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervousabout what the outcome might be," Kistler said, in explainingwhy Hughes had made the counter proposal.    "We need additional time to understand why Baker did notaccept our proposal."    Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker "was nota factor" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposalon the table.    He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.    Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider acompromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.    The Justice Department in January said it would block theHughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless bothcompanies agreed to sign a consent decree that would providefor the sale of the assets after the merger took place.    The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree becauseits was too "unreasonable." Hughes said that Baker shouldinstead complete the sale of the disputed assets before themerger is finalized and given government approval.    Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptablebuyers within a specified period of time after the decree isapproved, a federal trustee would become responsible forfinding a buyer.    Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could takeup to 10 years to complete the sales.    He also expressed concern that the combined companies mightbe required by the government's conditions to license some ofits technology to any purchaser of the assets.    Baker said last night in a statement that the requiredassets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,representing about three pct of the revenues of the combinedcompanies. Reuter
FRANCE TO SELL STAKE IN SOCIETE GENERALE UNIT The French government is tosell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in SocieteGenerale <STGN.PA>'s regional bank subsidiary <Societe GeneraleAlsacienne de Banque>, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENALofficials said.    SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is theleading French regional bank and has branches in Austria,Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland.    Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the shareoffer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by FinanceMinister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.    Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised laterthis year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in thebank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.    SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidatedgroup profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160mln this year and 159 mln in 1985.    SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capitalincrease to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mlnfrancs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight,giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.    The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, inline with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of aregional operation, Geronimus said.    He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Tenpct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employeeswith the rest offered to the public. There will not be a sharereserved for foreign investors. "This is too small an operationand anyway they will be able to buy shares in France," he said.    Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs.    Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforceits existing strong points, with no major projects plannedapart from the opening soon of a Basle branch.    SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up thefirst foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at itsStrasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreignbanking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse.

TALKING POINT/PIEDMONT <PIE> Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid forUSAir Group <U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc,which was being courted by USAir.    Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc <TWA> made a 1.4billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAirtakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close toaccepting the bid.    Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer andsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in itstakeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA wasoff 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spreadit would be taken over.    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attemptto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract asuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.   "The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer orPiedmont and USAir announce a deal," speculated one arbitrager.    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the currentprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid willsucceed.    Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, NorfolkSouthern Corp <NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for thecompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half ofPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price ofPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline isdestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is theleast likely to be bought.    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation inthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of athree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn'soffer, which lacked financing and was riddled withcontingencies.    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of twoairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.    "You can't discount him," said one arbitrager.    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he isserious by following through with his threats or making a newoffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to godirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lowerprice if USAir rejected his offer.    "It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing," saidone arbitrager.    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced byabout six dlrs per share.    Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airlinecombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, butothers believe it could be cleared if the companies areacquired separately.    "TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal towork," said one analyst.    Analysts said such a merger would be costly andcomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahnsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions.    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wagescale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,analysts said.    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, theysaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be anecessary ingredient for a merger to work.    However, other analysts speculated the managements ofPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a newcompany. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a wayfor him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then mergedinto TWA. Reuter
BAKER INT'L <BKO> HOPES TO COMPLETE MERGER Baker International Corp treasurer EricMattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposedmerger with Hughes Tool Co <HT> but declined to say if or whatcompromises might be acceptable to it.    The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlroilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday whenHughes management, balking at the terms of a government consentdecree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.

HUGHES <HT> CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT A one billion dlr lawsuit pushedHughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of aproposed merger with Baker International Corp <BKO>, WallStreet analysts said.    Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker wasoff. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages fromHughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes saidit was still interested in the merger.    The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that itstroubles could make it a takeover candidate.    There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallasinvestor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reutershe is not interested.    Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securitiesand Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more insome publicly traded company. He declined to identify thetarget other than to rule out Hughes.    One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughesturnabout was Borg-Warner Corp <BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct ofHughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on theHughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker.    Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in amerger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile,analysts said no one could be certain where the situation wasgoing.    "I think the merger is not going through," said Phil Pace,analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger "lost alot of its appeal" when the U.S. Department of Justice requiredthat Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.    Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view ofthe total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said "30 to 40pct of the cost savings are tied up in that."    "They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,"said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc."Apparently they are willing to continue discussions butwhether they will alter their position, I don't know.    "It's getting a little confusing," said James Carroll,analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments citedby Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger "tend to be weak."Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger itwanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longerperiod of time.    Hughes contended it was better to formally combine thecompanies with the status of Reed already settled. Bakerapparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.    Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mlndlrs in savings if the companies were combined without sellingReed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will besaved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.    Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was firstsigned "the outlook for the industry has improved materially."Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industryis lifting.

CHEMLAWN <CHEM> REJECTS WASTE'S <WMX> OFFER ChemLawn Corp said its boardrejected Waste Management Inc's 27 dlr-per-share tender offerand urged its shareholders not to tender their shares.    ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financialadvisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek otherpurchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value.    ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or"poison pill," during a 120-intermin safeguard period its boardadopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through anymeans other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks otherpurchasers.    ChemLawn also said it began litigation against WasteManagement in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive andother relief.    The suit alleges, among other things, that certain WasteManagement officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stockbefore making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchasespossibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and theSecurities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules.    Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquireChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.    ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offerwas inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders,and could "adversely affect" the interests of its employees,suppliers, creditors, and customers.    "Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer andconcluded that it does not fully reflect the value of thecompany. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender theirshares to Waste Management," said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen.    ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protectshareholders against abusive tactics, such as "marketaccumulations by Waste Management or others."    Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will bedistributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawncommon.    ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of itscommon for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of itscommmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all itsshares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board.    It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days afterthey become exercisable if later than that date. It said itsboard may redeem the rights for five cts per right any timeprior to their exercise date.    ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchasespurusant to Waste Management's present tender offer.    It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of recordMarch 20. Reuter

DOME<DMP> REPEATS DOME MINES<DM> STAKE FOR SALE Dome Petroleum Ltd's 23.2 pct stake ofgold producer Dome Mines Ltd continues to be for sale "at theright price," spokesman David Annesley said in response to aninquiry.    Reaffirming remarks made last year by chairman HowardMacdonald, Annesley said the company is considering selling itsstake in Dome Mines.    Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in <Encor EnergyCorp Ltd>, Annesley said "Encor is a strategic investment forDome, and we have no intention of selling it."    Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question thathe was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward thesale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares.    He also declined to specify at what price the company wouldconsider selling it shares.    "Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (ofDome Mines stock) are very attractive," Annesley commented.    "We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a timewhen the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs," he added. Aprice of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered "fairlyattractive," Annesley said.    Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its DomeMines' shares at a premium to market prices. "There might be anopportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would bevirtually a control block in Dome Mines," he said.

NORDBANKEN TO AUCTION ITS FERMENTA SHARES Sweden's <Nordbanken> banking groupsaid it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loancollateral by Fermenta AB's <FRMS.ST> founder and former chiefexecutive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself.    The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 --was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan.    The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse'sunofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986.Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid forthe shares although it expected to buy them back itself.    The statement said the sale did not represent anywithdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermentagroup and that it had been sanctioned by the other mainshareholders.    Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loansof 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks whichlast month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solveits immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other mainshareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mlncrowns until a new equity issue could be made.    Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders'meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue.    Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crownloan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results.    Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mlncrowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor andshareholder <Gotabanken> and the group's new majority owner<Industrivarden AB>.

LUCKY STORES <LKS>, EDELMAN IN STANDSTILL PACT Lucky Stores Inc said it andinvestor Asher Edelman agreed on a settlement that prohibitsEdelman and his group from taking specified actions to obtaincontrol of the company and that limits the Edelman group'sownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any votingsecurities.    The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pendinglitigation between the parties, Lucky Stores said.    The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman'smotion to intervene in pending shareholder actions againstLucky Stores and its directors, the company said.    In addition, the standstill provisions also apply toHancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, thecompany said.    Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for thecompany to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set forDecember 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their viewsconcerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the votingpower of substantial Lucky stockholders.    Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock,last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company.    Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuringprogram that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its owncommon shares and reincorporation in Delaware.    The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retailstores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program.    Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnershipsubsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposedreincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase andrestructuring plan.

DOME PETE<DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressurefrom one of its largest creditors, <Canadian Imperial Bank ofCommerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in <Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,energy industry analysts said.    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security forpart of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock topay down debt, analysts said.    "The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in thedirection that might make it a saleable asset," said one analystwho asked not to be named.    Dome earlier said it was not considering selling EncorEnergy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest inCanadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd <DM> is up for sale "atthe right price."    Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment thatit does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. TheEncor shares do not pay dividends.    A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when askedwhether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.    At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would bevalued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Minesshares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.    Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may alsoprompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in theCanadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.    "Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially inrecent weeks with a runup in crude prices," Peters and Co Ltdoil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.    "The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see itsold at these levels because they can get more for it now thanthey have been able to in recent years," he added.    Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around sixdlrs in early February.    The company also recently set up its own operatingmanagement, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.    Dome and Encor "are actually going to get farther apart. So(the sale) does make a lot of sense," Mote said.    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divestEncor in favor of retaining the operating assets since saleproceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt toCommerce Bank.    "I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long asthey can," said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.    Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move toblock such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.    "Other creditors generally all want to make sure thatsomething they might be able to get a piece of is not beingsold out from under them," said analyst Gobert.    Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr jointliability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by ArcticPetroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder thepossible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum'sdebt and has a "right of consent" to the sale of Dome Petroleum'sholding.    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shareswould seek some type of relief on the company's debtobligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.    Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at whatprice the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share "are veryattractive."

USAIR <U> SEEKS ORDER AGAINST TWA <TWA> USAir Group said it sought the helpof the U.S. Department of Transportation in its takeover fightwith Trans World Airlines Inc, asking the Department to orderTWA to sell its USAir shares.    "What they have done is in direct violation of the FederalAviation Act," USAir said.    It said TWA week filed a cursory application with theDepartment of Transportation for approval of its proposed 1.65billion dlr takeover of USAir.    USAir rejected the offer and said it asked the Departmentof Transportation to dismiss the application.    USAir said it requested the dismissal because TWA avoidedpre-merger notification requirements, and also did not providea competitive and public interest analysis required underregulations.    USAir said if the application is dismissed, TWA would belimited to buying only 1.5 pct of its 31.7 mln outstandingshares. If the application is approved, TWA could buy up to 10pct, it said. TWA has said it owns less than 10 pct of USAir'sstock.    TWA today revealed that it has increased its holdings tomore than four mln USAir shares, 15 pct of the outstanding.

USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option tobuy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances.Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding.

The company said its merger agreement with Piedmontprovides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont'sprior written consent in any way that would be adverse toPiedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number ofshares to be bought without Piedmont's consent.    USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares tobe purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum numberneeded to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to besatisfied.

FIRST BOSTON AFFILIATE TO ACQUIRE ALLEGHENY INT'L FOR 24.60  Southern Co said it will take anafter-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later thanJanuary 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclearpower plant has risen abover the amount which retail customersin Georgia will be asked to pay.    The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, saidthe budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mlndlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the madelast year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increasedcost will not be included in the utility's retail electricrates.    Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduledcompletion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added.    The utility said fuel loading has been completed at UnitOne and the unit is being put through a series of low-powertests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for afull-power license.    The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., isco-owned by <Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal ElectricAuthority of Georgia and the city of Dalton.    Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate wasdue to several factors, including additional labor costsincurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule forcommercial operation by June. The new figure represents thefirst change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when itwas estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs.    In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would"cap" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to payat 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Powersaid, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs.    Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a chargeagainst earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes.    In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contractswith the joint owners require the utility to buy backsignificant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant'sinitial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, itwill not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increasethat applies to the buybacks.    This bings the total amount that must be charged againstearnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said.    Southern said new rules of the Financial AccountingStandards Board, which are effective in January 1988, requireany costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be chargedagainst earnings once that determination is made.    The company also said its board has approved a capitalbudget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on theVogtle project.    It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-yearperiod 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting, notingthis is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years1986-1988.

GENCORP<GY> UNIT TO SELL LOS ANGELES TV STATION Gencorp said its RKO Generalsubsidiary agreed to sell KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to Walt DisneyCo <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs cash plus working capital and otheradjustments at closing.    The company said under the agreement in principle, RKO'sapplication to renew the station's broadcast license would bedismissed and the competing application of Fidelity Televisionwould be granted. Disney would then acquire privately heldFidelity for about 103 mln dlrs and other adjustments.    Renewal of the KHJ-TV license has been challenged inregulatory proceedings for more than 20 years.    The deal is subject to prior approval by the FederalCommunications Commission, the company said.    Late in 1985, Gencorp cut a deal with Fidelity, a LosAngeles investor group, and Westinghouse Electric Corp <WX> tosettle the license proceedings and sell KHJ-TV for 313 mlndlrs, 70 pct of which would go to Westinghouse and theremainder to Fidelity.

Fidelity Television originally filed a competingapplication for the RKO license for KHJ, an independentstation, in 1965.    In 1980, the FCC disqualified RKO as licensee of WNAC-TV inBoston, citing anti-competitive trade practices and inaccuratefinancial reporting to the agency, causing renewals previouslygranted to RKO in New York, for WOR, and Los Angeles, for KHJ,to be denied.

AMC SAYS IT IS "STUDYING" CHRYSLER BUYOUT PROPOSAL AND WILL COMMENT WHEN "APPR Petro-Canada, Canada'sstate-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineationwells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshoreNewfoundland.    Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering workshould put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a developmentplan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.    Depending on time required for regulatory approvals,construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production asearly as 1991, Petro-Canada said.    "We have a high degree of confidence that the westernportion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mlncubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels,and that we could produce it economicly using a floatingproduction system," Petro-Canada said.    The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St.John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, wasdiscovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.    "We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion ofthe field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove upadditional reserves there," the company said.    Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercialprospect and the company wants to move some of those resourcestowards development so it can start generating a return oninvestments, Petro-Canada said.    Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells,has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block ofthe Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's EastFlank block, a company spokesman said later. Other fieldparticipants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd,Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, TrilliumExploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.    Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field'sGraven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil,company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgaryoffice.    Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's EastFlank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels,he added.    Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrsto bring the field to production by about 1991, and thedevelopment budget could double if the company builds aproduction system combining both blocks in the field, he said.    Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven blockwould produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average dailyproduction, with a production system that would have maximumcapacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said inanswer to a query.    The company estimates a production system combining bothGraven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field couldproduce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said. Reuter

DART GROUP SAID IT OFFERS TO BUY SUPERMARKETS GENERAL AT 41.75  The Agriculture Department will haveto release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kindcertificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDAdecides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgraindeficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said.    Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available tofeed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments forthe 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated theywant to do the same for feedgrains.    Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corndeficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final paymentmust be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split.    However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs ofdeficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs,doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.    Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitationfrom the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another hugerelease of certs onto the market.    Bills are pending in Congress to move up the finalfeedgrain deficiency payment to "as soon as five months afterharvest as possible," rather than the current year lag time.    Neither Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill.) nor Sen. Bob Dole(R-Kans.), sponsors of the bills, have brought the legislationforward. Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions. Reuter

NORANDA TO SPIN OFF FOREST INTERESTS INTO SEPARATE American Petroleum Institute PresidentCharles DiBona said no options should be rejected to combat growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.    "No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas,floor prices, tax incentives or other alternatives--while anational dialogue on the issue continues," DiBona said at a paper institute conference in New York today.    DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry onhow to stimulate energy production but there is consensus onremoving several government policies that hinder investments innew prospects.    DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolishedimmediately and current proposals for increased environmentalregulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be notadopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National WildlifeRefuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oilcompanies, DiBona said.    "This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if thenation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil," DiBonasaid. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen whileconsumption rose and that has raised dependence on importedoil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said.    Reuter

CHRYSLER <C> AMC BUYOUT VALUED AT 1.55 BILLION Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition ofAmerican Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs,including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs inAmerican Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said.    They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.    The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefingChrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company'sagreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mlndlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is notincluded valuing the transaction.    Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposedpurchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected thetransaction would carry with it a short-term dilution inChrysler's earnings.    A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, toldReuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than itwould have been had a deal been struck last year because theimpact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability toassume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwardsaccumulated from its losses since 1980.    "There were very serious discussions last fall but wedidn't pull it off," the source said in a reference to theassassination in November of former Renault chairman GeorgesBesse.    "It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor.And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd doneit before the end of last year."    In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, thesource said Chrysler would also assume any liability fromlawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called "an overhangto the company."    Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them thatthe deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principalin the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mlndlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25mln dlrs in cash for "transaction fees" in connection with theacquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paidAMC shareholders.    "The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,"analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.     Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal.     But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC'sliabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMCdebt that is being carried at "non-market" rates.    He said there were difficulties in negotiating with theprevious Renault management on the acquisition because theywere committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was anintegral part.    "The new management didn't have that problem - AMC wasn'ttheir baby," he said. Reuter

HUGHES TOOL SAYS IT APPROVES REVISED TERMS FOR MERGER WITH BAKER INTER OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment tofixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and anoverall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) todefend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.    He told a news conference here "After due consultation withmy colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeriaand all member countries of OPEC remain determined to upholdthe December agreement by adhering strictly to their variousquotas and official selling prices."    Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.    "We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleadingnews in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC membercountries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in themonth of February," Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.    Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firmdetermination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrsagreed upon last December in Geneva.    The December agreement set an overall output ceiling forOPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixedprices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.    Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord butfell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing morethan the agreed level.    "The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would nothold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases ofOPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs," Lukmansaid.    He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was basedon the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, addingthat Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000bpd.    Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,while the production figures of Ecuador and the United ArabEmirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.    "If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreementsucceed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price levelof 18 dlrs," the group's president said.    He said the OPEC price differentials committee meetingformerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.    "Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference isat the moment contemplated since most agreements reached inDecember are being adhered to," he said.    Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrowthe gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed inrelation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied "We considerthe defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials."    Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawnon stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels wellbelow this time last year and soon they would return to themarket in search of crude.    "We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty inmaintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,"Lukman said.    The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which hesaid had contributed to the group's efforts to stabiliseprices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-heldview not to do anything to help the market.    "We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term withtwo-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future isours. We will use that advantage responsibly," he said.    Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's outputfollowing an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if theSouth American country would be allowed a higher output quotawhen it recovered from the disaster.

CHRYSLER <C> DEAL LEAVES UNCERTAINTY FOR AMC WORKERS Chrysler Corp's 1.5 billion dlr bid totakeover American Motors Corp <AMO> should help bolster thesmall automaker's sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000employees in doubt, industry analysts say.    It was "business as usual" yesterday at the American Motorsheadquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled byChrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, according to companyspokesman Edd Snyder.    But AMC's future, to be discussed at a board meeting today,would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than ifit had continued with the state-run French car group as itscontrolling shareholder.    Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assemblyplant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant wouldbe in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North Americanauto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass.    Both plants are far from "state of the art" for carmanufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor laborrelations at each.    "Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants," said MichaelLuckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm ShearsonLehman Brothers. "They probably will close the Toledo plant andmove Jeep production to Canada."    Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at thevery least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able towring concessions from the United Automobile Workers unionlocal representing Jeep workers.    "The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as theyhave AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will haveunderutilized facilities to transfer production," he said.    Analysts said they foresaw no major complications thatwould abort a combination which historians said would be theauto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formedin 1954.    AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its lossesof more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in Francefor Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it couldnot forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at theearliest.    In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman LeeIacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mlndlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of1,200 dealers as the major attractions.    Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventuallyto sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overheadcosts in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incurin the AMC buyout.

JONES AND VINING SAID VULCAN CORP OFFERS FIVE DLRS A SHARE F The Farmers Home Administration, theU.S. Agriculture Department's farm lending arm, could loseabout seven billion dlrs in outstanding principal on itsseverely delinquent borrowers, or about one-fourth of its farmloan portfolio, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said.    In remarks prepared for delivery to the Senate AgricultureCommittee, Brian Crowley, senior associate director of GAO,also said that a preliminary analysis of proposed changes inFmHA's financial eligibility standards indicated as many as onehalf of FmHA borrowers who received new loans from the agencyin 1986 would be ineligible under the proposed system.    The agency has proposed evaluating applicants' credit usinga variety of financial ratios instead of relying solely oncashflow ability.    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)slammed the proposed eligibility changes, telling FmHAAdministrator Vance Clark at a hearing that they would mark a"dramatic shift" in the agency's purpose away from being farmers'lender of last resort toward becoming a "big city bank."    But Clark defended the new regulations, saying the agencyhad a responsibility to administer its 70-billion dlr loanportfolio in a "compassionate yet judicious manner."

But the scheme had received a guarded reception from theSocial Christian parties in Belgium's centre-right coalitionwhen Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday.    Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult,the sources said.

A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid-1989 for 1.5billion francs, while 50 pct of the postal andtelecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages inmid-1990 and early 1992, raising at least seven billion francs.

WALL STREET STOCKS/TENNECO INC <TGT> Tenneco Inc, a company that has longbeen rumored to be a takeover candidate, rose sharply todaywhen speculation surfaced that investor T. Boone Pickens may betargeting the company for an acquisition, traders and analystssaid.    Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said "we have no comment tomake whatsoever." Pickens was not available for comment.    Traders noted that activity in the stock increased todayafter a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco.    Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4.    Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard,Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised atmarket rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeoverattempt.    "It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and hisgroup may be interested," Feretti said.    "But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of itssheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes achallenge."    Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take overDallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp <DIA> last winter, has madeno secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gasreserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize soonerthan oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimatedin excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said.    Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow ofabout 10 dlrs a share "which is probably very attractive toPickens." Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup valuewell into the 60 dlr a share range.    "I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostiletakeover," Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analystJohn Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors.    "Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrsin long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding." He said thebuyer would also have to deal with "the intractable problems"Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energybusinesses.    Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number ofdefensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such asspin off some of its non-energy businesses directly toshareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnershipout of its natural gas pipeline interests.    An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouragedthe Pickens rumor. "Pickens has a plateful already with hisholdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess," he said. "Idon't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problemswith Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losingabout 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billiondlrs on the market today."

WALL STREET STOCKS/SUPERMARKETS GENERAL <SGL> Dart Group Corp <DARTA>, which wantsto acquire Supermarkets General Corp for 1.62 billion dlrs, isnot likely to give up without a fight if its target seeksanother buyer, arbitrageurs said.    Speculation that Dart's offer of 41.75 dlrs per share couldbe just the beginning of a bidding contest helped Supermarketsshares gain one to 42-1/8  on 2.3 mln shares.    One rumor had Federated Department Stores Inc <FDS> takinga look at Supermarkets General. "Our policy is that we do notcomment on any rumors or speculation of this nature," aFederated spokeswoman said.    An arbitrageur noted that Dart, controlled by chairmanHerbert H. Haft and his son Robert, last year raised itsinitial bid for Safeway Stores by approximately 10 pct whenSafeway resisted.    However, that company was later sold to a buyout group thattopped the Hafts.    If history repeats itself, the Hafts could raise their bidto 46 dlrs if they are rebuffed by Supermarkets General, thearbitrageur said. But another arbitrageur said the Hafts'present bid seemed "quite fair." He said the offer amounts to10 times after-tax-cash flow which is "probably fully priced." Reuter

HUGHES TOOL SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE MERGER WITH BAKER INTER Wall Street market analysts said twochanges in the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Averagewere part of a shift away from smokestack industries that havelong dominated the 30-stock index.    "It strengthens the Dow," said William LeFevre, analyst atAdvest Inc. He said Coca-Cola Co <KO>, one of the twoadditions, "is a genuine consumer stock as opposed to asmokestack." He applauded the decision to drop Inco Ltd <N>, "asuper stock at one time that hasn't done much lately."    The editors of the Wall Street Journal also decided to addBoeing Co <BA> and dropping Owens-Illinois Inc <OI>.    Charles Jensen of MKI Securities said Inco was a "stodgynumber." But he noted that putting two new stocks in an averageof 30 is a relatively minor change.    "This will distinctly make the index more useful," saidFrank Korth of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "The movement ofthe market to the upside will be enhanced by the shift toCoke."    But he said Shearson's aerospace analyst today removedBoeing from the firm's recommended list, taking it from a buyto a hold. Korth said Boeing's business appeared to be leaningtoo heavily to the military side as opposed to commercial.    Prior to tomorrow's market opening the Wall Street Journalwill publish a new divisor to be used in calculating the index.LeFevre said the divisor will probably go up a bit but willprobably be lower than its current level of 0.889 later in theyear due to forthcoming splits in components such asInternational Paper Co <IP>.    The divisor, which is adjusted whenver stocks are split,dropped below one for the first time in May of last year. The0.889 divisor means that a change of 1/8 (12.5 cts) in theprice of a component produces a change of about 14 cts in theindex. Reuter

HARPER AND ROW GETS BID FROM HARCOURT BRACE JOVANOVICH FOR 50  An overwhelming majority of Hughes ToolCo shareholders approved a merger agreement with BakerInternational Corp based on revised terms that allow thecompanies additional time to sell a drilling bit business asrequired by the U.S. Justice Department.     Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms ofthe proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on howmuch funding the newly combined companies will have to spend onthe disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.    An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish afunding limit.    The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell throughearlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposedJustice Department consent decree that would have given thecompanies only three months to find a buyer for the Reedbusiness.    Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlrlawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with themerger.    Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct ofHughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revisedterms of the agreement give the companies six months to find abuyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previousagreement had proposed a three-month period.    Kistler said the the government had also indicated it wouldconsider granting, if necessary, an additional three-monthextension to complete the sale.    He said there were "several people looking" at the domesticdrilling bit business.    The companies, Kistler said, have also decided tovoluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.    Kistler estimated that the merger, which should becompleted in about two weeks, will result in annual costsavings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects "substantialcutbacks" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc,the name the merged company will take.    Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficienciesshould put the company on a profitable course. "We think thatin the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should seesomething close to breakeven," he said.    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrson sales of 215.7 mln dlrs.    Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs. Reuter

LEIGH-PEMBERTON OPPOSES TAKEOVER PROTECTION RULES The Bank of England does not favour theintroduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeoverattempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.

Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve tieswith institutional investors, suggesting representatives ofthose institutions be granted seats on the boards of directorsof companies they invest in.    "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,for that is but a short step from saying that they should beprotected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,the proprietors of the company," Leigh-Pemberton said.    He added takeovers and mergers had an important role toplay in furthering economies of scale, integration and moreefficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure(of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether ornot the takeover was contested," he said.    Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeoveractivity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise acompany's management into action dedicated solely to afavourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partlyor even primarily at the expense of the future," he said.    Such bids "often depend for their success on creating ahighly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, toengage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that areimmensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders," hesaid.    In a clear reference recent events, he said "those in theCity who act for companies or individuals ..

BORG-WARNER TO SELL INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS BUSINESS FOR ABOUT 240  The worst may be just about over forJapan's battered economy but economists said they do not expecta vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economistspolled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown islikely to end in the first half of this year, helped by risingexports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. "Theeconomy will bottom out in the middle of the year," saidSumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido.    Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist SusumuTaketomi agreed. "It (the bottom) is in the offing," he said.    But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in thefiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct,from two pct in the current year, he said.    Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worstare increasing.    The volume of exports in the first two months of the yearrose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining towardthe end of last year.    Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as asharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks,several economists said it could mark the beginning of arecovery.    Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smallerthan expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan surveyreleased last week showed that the decline in Japanesecorporate earnings may be nearing its end.    And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopesthe rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said.    Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. AndWest Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilisecurrencies around current levels.    The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last twoyears has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing itscompanies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.    "The important thing is the exchange rate," Taketomi said.    If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raiseinvestment in plant and equipment, although there are no signsof that yet, economists said.    A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of theircompetitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting torecover, economists said.    Domestically, the economy may get a boost from someloosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said HaruoMuto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.    The next reading of the economy's health should come earlynext week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter,1986.    Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct fromthe previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.    But a senior government official said the fourth quarterfigures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one pointquarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statisticalaberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.    To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, theeconomy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourthquarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.     The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably astatistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of1986, the official said.    Economists said the fourth quarter figures were alsodistorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the secondhalf of 1986.    Because the coins were classified as legal tender, theirpurchase did not show up in the statistics on consumerexpenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in Decemberbecause of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-yearbonuses, they said.    As the government had to buy back some of the coins fromretailers because they were unsold, the government'scontribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have beenboosted, economists said.    Taketomi said it may have received a further boost fromgovernment buying of farm products as the domestic crop lastyear was good.    The senior government official said the fourth quarterperformance of the domestic sector was probably worse thangenerally expected, while that of the external sector wasbetter. REUTER

TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER CORP <PCC> Purolator Courier corp's stock rose onspecualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director wouldfind a new suitor for the company, traders said.    Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members ofits Purolator courier division's management.    The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one.    Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resignedfrom its board of directors in a letter dated March 10.    The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board becausethe merger agreement with Hutton barred directors fromsoliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get abetter deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might befound if the company would agree to be sold to some otherentity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courierdivision.    "Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it'sbeing sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs," said Gardner in a telephoneinterview with Reuters.    Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firmassociated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelitycompanies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said hepersonally owns 20,000 shares.    A Purolator official said the company has no comment on theletter from Gardner.    Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger servicemay emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before thetransaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had alsospeculated another courier company would be the most likelysuitor.    While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be nonew bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushedthe stock into play again.    "There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a questionof management's willingness to let the process continue," saidone arbitrager.    Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because theybelieve Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrscash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be boughtfor securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.courier operations.    The arbitragers said tender offer documents show thatHutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction andwill emerge with a giant, majority equity interest inPurolator.    "As far as I can tell from the public documents from thedeal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.One always likes a situation like that. You always like tothink if they can do this deal at no risk, there should besomeone else in the world that could do it higher," said onearbitrager.    The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, andsources close to the transaction disputed the claim that thefirm will not end up paying for its equity position.    While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer documentdid note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have tokeep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is somerisk to the firm.    "There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,and all sorts of things that make it very speculative," saidone of the sources, adding there are also severance payments toemployees.    The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrsin so-called "bridge" financing for the transaction. The bridgefinancing is a temporary loan from Hutton.    The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time toreplace the financing, the source said, resulting in what couldbe a substantial expense to the firm.    Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mlndlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transactionsaid fees are at the low end of the scale.    "It's a very complex transaction, but basically whathappens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recaptureany investment they might have once the merger takes place,"Gardner said. Reuter

Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderhamlast year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns'<Gulf Canada Corp> acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pactafter a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of<Hiram Walker Resources Ltd>.    "We are getting along very well as partners ... I hopethere won't be any change, but there could be," Holden-Browntold reporters after a speech in Toronto.    He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that couldforce Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, andGulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligateAllied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct.    "Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasionfor either the put or call to be exercised," Holden-Brown said.    In answer to a reporter's question, Holden-Brown said itwould be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent. "I don'tthink we would have any objection to it," he added.    Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham'sboard of directors and has total responsibility for itsmanagement. "We cannot contemplate giving up our control," hesaid.    Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profitcontribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons' financialresults, but he said "it will be substantial."    "I am not able to give profit forecasts," he said.    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance theHiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings,and has no current plans for a stock issue.    He said the company is not currently negotiating any moreacquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluatingpossible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or foodconcerns. "I don't think we shall be looking at the breweryscene (which is) highly concentrated already," he added.

JAPAN REJECTS U.S. OBJECTIONS TO FAIRCHILD SALE A Foreign Ministry official dismissedarguments made by senior U.S. Government officials seeking toblock the sale of a U.S. Microchip maker to a Japanese firm.    "They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues,"Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North AmericanDivision told Reuters.    U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked theWhite House to consider blocking the sale of <FairchildSemiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T>, U.S.Officials said yesterday.    Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave theU.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital hightechnology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence SecretaryCaspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale.    U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu apowerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers whileJapan's supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales.    Takemoto said national security should not be an issuesince the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner,Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>, does not include Fairchild's maindefence-related division.    In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputertrade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not makesupercomputers.    Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticatedmicrochips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chipsand supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said.    Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposedtakeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying "the purchasewould not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductormarket."    Two separate issues appear to have come together to boostpressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said.    The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open itsdomestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said.    U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanesepublic sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despiteU.S. Firms' technological lead in the field.    "The United States believes Japan will only react whenbullied, and this is a bullying ploy," Salomon Brothers Asiaanalyst Carole Ryavec said.    However, the analysts said more is at stake thansupercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vitalsemiconductor industry to Japanese competitors.    "The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,"said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co.    U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade hasfailed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firmsto abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricingand opening Japan's market.    A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abidingby the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale ofmicrochips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below thoseset by the pact.    "It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,"he told Reuters.    Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on theacquisition in line with the basic agreement reached withSchlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters. REUTER

CAESARS WORLD INC SAID BOARD REJECTS MARTIN SOSNOF The United States this week signaledit is pressing commercial banks, increasingly disenchanted withproviding large cash loans to debtor nations, to develop newways of financing that will prove more acceptable to bothsides.    Heading off challenges to its Third World debt strategy,U.S. officials also say they think concessions should be madeto debtors that enact reforms speeding inflation-free growth.    In particular, they stress new techniques that shift theemphasis from debt to equity and shave interest rates.    "The strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative orconcept that there can be additional emphasis such as indebt-equity swaps and that sort of thing," a Reaganadministration official said of the slow pace of commercialbank lending to the Third World.    "The debtors have been performing well...some people arguethat taking 1-1/8 pct down to 13/16 pct is debt forgiveness.Well if that's what it is, fine. What it really is a narrowingof the spread that could be charged on new money," the officialsaid.    This week, therefore, U.S. officials signaled their backingfor a novel proposal by the Philippines that called for partialpayment of interest in tradeable investment notes.    On Tuesday, officials said Treasury Secretary James Bakertold Secretary of State George Shultz the idea was a creativeone and signaled his approval to Philippine Finance MinisterJamie Ongpin later that day. An administration official toldReuters this week the Philippines' proposal to partially payinterest with investment notes instead of cash should beconsidered seriously by the banks. An agreement with the banks,officials now say, is expected soon.    "New bank lending has been slow in materializing but thefact of the matter is there have been 70 billion dlrs in bankloans restructured, which is a form of extension of credit. Asyou know, there's been 8.5 billion dlrs in new money," said theofficial, who plays a key role in keeping the plan afloat.    The plan was launched in October 1985 by Secretary Bakerand called on commercial and multilateral banks to lend 29billion dlrs in the subsequent three years to major debtorsundertaking reforms that promoting economic growth.    But it has taken almost six months to complete thesyndication of a 7.5 billion dlrs loan to Mexico, which hascreated deep misgivings here about the liklihood of such largestraight cash loans being assembled ever again.    U.S. officials want the banks not only to consider swappingtheir debts for equity in local corporations -- a developmentthat has already met with success in Chile and Mexico -- but topin loans on specific projects, finance trade and investdirectly in debtor country private sectors.    These forms of lending, they say, give the banks a greaterstake and more economically secure return on investment.    In a major challenge to the U.S. plan, Brazil last monthdeclared a moratorium on interest payments and followed it upwith a world tour by officials seeking a political way out ofits 109 billion dlr debt burden.    The country is beset by a falling trade surplus anddwindling reserves endangering its ability to service itsforeeign debt, at 109 billion dlrs the Third World's largest.    One official attending the Washington talks with BrazilianFinance Minister Dilson Funaro said "they've come in here nowand said "Look, we're out of money, help us," but they haven'tcome in with a plan. And they've gone all over the world, andat every stop they've been told the same thing."    The official said Brazil would have to enact a credibleeconomic program, either in consultation with the World Bank orthe International Monetary Fund, to cool its overheated economybefore commercial banks would begin negotiations.    As a result of the Brazilian action, private banks andmajor debtor nations redoubled their efforts to reachagreements stretching out debt repayments.    For its part, the administration has signaled its strongsupport for new techniques that in some cases effectivelyamount to interest rate concessions for major debtor nations.    It pressed the banks to allow Chile to make annual insteadof bi-annual interest payments, speeding an accord.    Administration officials, who asked not to be named, havealso debated whether to allow banks greater flexibility inbuilding up loan loss reserves against Third World loans.    The debate centers on a rule, known as FASB-15, under whichbanks experiencing delayed interest payments on real estateloans need not set aside reserves against debt principal if itis believed payments will resume.    More recently, the rule was extended to cover farm andenergy loans and Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,has suggested it should be extended to Third World loans.    Bradley is prominent among Congressmen urging thatprovisions for debt relief be attached to tough new tradelegislation now being considered on Capitol Hill.    But the officials said the debate has been inconclusive. Reuter

SUNTER ACQUISITION BEGINS TENDER FOR ALLEGHENY INTERNATI Grain traders and analysts look for a10 to 12 mln acre sign-up in the USDA's conservation reserveprogram, scheduled to be announced after 1400 CST today.    The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of theacres submitted, they said.    Total enrollment in the first three years of the program isonly 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this yearhas underpinned new crop corn futures all week.    However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up mayend up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing tradetalk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submittedby farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservationprogram are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on totalcorn production will be minimal, they added. Reuter

PEPSICO OFFERS TO ACQUIRE CALNY INC FOR 11.50 DLRS Britain and West Germany told theirEuropean Community partners they would strongly oppose majorelements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses.    At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for afull debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that hasalready angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-ledprotests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said.    West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, willadvise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenanceother proposals that could hit German farmers, they added.    They said West Germany's objections were put in a letterthis weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, thepresident of the EC's Executive Commission which had putforward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new ECcash crisis.    Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cerealsproduction curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for aproposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) -a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level outforeign exchange fluctuations for farm exports.    Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit Germanfarmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult toexport to weaker currency states, which means virtually allother 11 EC states, diplomats said.    Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to imposea hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because itcould seriously damage EC trade relations.    The diplomats said the United States had been the mostoutspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing itas a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade bodyGATT.    But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC,such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina,Iceland and Norway, they added.    Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farmreform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures thatcould spark a damaging trade war with the U.S.    Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision oneither the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today,diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear thatneither has a chance of surviving when it comes up forsubstantive consideration by EC farm ministers later thismonth, they added. REUTER

SCHLUMBERGER <SLB> MAY HAVE ALTERNATE BUYER Schlumberger Ltd most likely has analternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit,Wall Street analysts said.    "I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement withFujitsu, Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal inthe works," said Paul Johnson, a semiconductor analyst withL.F. Rothschild.    "There are unquestionably other buyers out there," addedKidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. "A lot of companies havelooked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it."    Among the companies that would be interested in bidding forFairchild are Advanced Micro Devices <AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif.,and LSI Logic Corp <LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analystssaid.    Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp <NSM>,Texas Instruments Inc <TXN> and Motorola Inc <MOT> might alsoseek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrustproblems, the analysts added.    Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to beconsidering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino,Calif., company, analysts said.    In a brief statement announcing the termination of theagreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision openedup other possibilities, including a possible buyout byFairchild management.    The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu wouldhave bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,because rising opposition to the deal by the Reaganadministration made it unlikely that the sale could becompleted within a reasonable period of time.    Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing thatthe companies did not need government approval to complete thetransaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-ownedcompanies.    "Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal becausethe U.S. government didn't want it," said Johnson of L.F.Rothschild.    A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on thecompany's news release.    He said only that the company was reviewing a number ofpossible alternatives for the Fairchild unit.    Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediatelyavailable for comment.    Analysts noted the significance of the government'sapparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control ofFairchild.    Administration officials, including Commerce SecretaryMalcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese controlof key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and militaryweapons systems.    "The government really stood up for the semiconductorindustry," said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. "That, I think, isthe real significance of this."    Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government mightnow feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints aboutJapanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor tradeagreement signed last summer.

MCDERMOTT <MDR> SAYS STAKE VIOLATES LAW McDermott International Inc saidthe purchase of a 5.4 pct block of its stock was an apparentviolation of the laws of Panama, its country of incorporation.

ICAHN SAYS HE IS TARGET OF SEC INVESTIGATION Corporate raider Carl Icahnacknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigationby the Securities and Exchange Commission into possibleviolations of securities laws.    Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc<TWA>, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required tomake with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group.    The SEC issued a formal order launching the privateinvestigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing.    The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find outwhether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities lawsand related rules, Icahn said.    Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition andsubsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certainunspecified companies, he said.    Federal law requires individuals or groups of individualswho have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes incompanies of at least five pct within 10 days.    Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed inconnection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he hasdisclosed that he is among those being investigated.    By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which isobviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was alsoalerting current and potential shareholders of TWA.    It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that theyor their officers are the targets of government probes toacknowledge the existence of the otherwise secretinvestigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirementsto their shareholders.    Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and otherswhom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring andselling more than five pct of a company's stock.    SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securitieslaw violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probeinto the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according topublished reports.    Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amountof stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or makingno filing at all could indicate a scheme to "warehouse" sharesof stock.    In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting inconcert would each amass stock in the company withoutdisclosing that they have an agreement among them.    By failing to disclose that they are acting together themarket is unware of the amount of stock of a company that iscontrolled by a group acting in concert.    Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzbergfamily of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme whileit was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc. Reuter

U.S. DECLINES COMMENT ON SCHLUMBERGER<SLB> MOVE A U.S. Commerce Department spokesmansaid the agency would have no comment on Schlumberger Ltd'sannouncement that it had terminated an agreement in principleto sell its Fairchild Semiconductor Corp unit to Fujitsu Ltd.

FAIRCHILD DEAL FAILURE SEEN MAKING JAPANESE WARY Schlumberger Ltd's <SLB.N> decision toend an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> to buy80 pct of its <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, and the politicalfurore that surrounded the proposed sale, will make Japanesecompanies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. Hightechnology firms but will not halt such attempts, industryanalysts said.    The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow toFujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion bythe Japanese firm, said analysts polled by Reuters.    "The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu'sNorth American operations, but it would have been a greatboost," James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said.    French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was endingthe agreement because mounting political controversy in theU.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stakecould be completed in a reasonable time.    The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department andDefence Department, partly on national security grounds.    Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given theJapanese computer maker control of a comprehensive NorthAmerican sales and distribution system and access tomicroprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak,analysts said.    The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additionalmicrochip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in theU.S., A report by the Capel firm said.    "It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and amarketing channel for other things," said Barclays de Zoete Weddanalyst Rick May.    Several analysts said the purchase would not have givenFujitsu access to critical defence technology.    "(Fairchild) simply doesn't have key technology -- that's athing of the past," May said.    The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu asit might have had to spend several hundred million dollars tomodernise Fairchild's production lines, Capel's Murtha said.    The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanesefirms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. Hightech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said.    Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costlyroute of expanding its own production and distributionfacilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use theestimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try toacquire some less politically symbolic firm.    "It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but thenecessity of expanding their production and design capacity inAmerica remains," said Capel's Murtha. "The Japanese willcontinue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to findones that are politically acceptable."    Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures orsmaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlashthat blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. "They're notgoing to slow up, they're just going to buy smaller pieces ...Because of the political risk," said Barclays de Zoete's May.    Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pctshares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as superminicomputer makers, he said.    Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end upharming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinationaltie-ups, some analysts said.    "This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either," saidJardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. "Thepooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move --why should the government step in to prevent it?"    Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry HajimeTamura told a press conference that interference by U.S.Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate.    "This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matterfor governments' comment," Tamura said. "I think it was improperfor U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent theydid," he said.    A spokesman told Reuters the ministry's view is thatinternational investment flows ought to be free and that suchflows are of increasing importance in line with the growingcloseness of U.S.-Japanese economic ties.

ATT-PHILIPS BID FOR CGCT OUTLINED American Telephone and Telegraph Co andPhilips Telecommunications BV (APT) would hold 36 pct throughdirect and indirect holdings in France's <Cie Generale deConstructions Telephoniques> if a joint bid with Frenchpartners for the soon-to-be-privatised firm succeeds, adirector at one of the partner firms said.    Marc Mathieu of <Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications>SAT, told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pctfor APT, the joint firm set up by the U.S.'s ATT <T.N.> and theNV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS>.    The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company madeup of SAT, APT, Cie du Midi <MCDP.PA> and five mutual funds.   Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost theirstake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.    The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject toclose discussions within the government due to legal queriesover the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministryofficial said.    Although bought by French citizens they are managed byforeign banks <Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York> and<Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet SA>, controlled byAlgemene Bank Nederland NV <ABNN.AS>, an SAT spokesman said.    CGCT, which controls 16 pct of the French public telephoneswitching market, is to be sold by the government for 500 mlnfrancs by private tender.    Five groups are bidding for the company and the governmenthas said it will choose CGCT's new owner by the end of April.    APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference acapital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, butdeclined to give details or say how an increase would affectforeign stakes in CGCT.    In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales ofthree billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs.    A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committedto investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and productionplants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT toproduce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it toFrench standards.    The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement forATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introductionof the French government privatisation laws which reopenedbidding among a wider range of applicants.    Other candidacies to take over CGCT include West Germany'sSiemens AG <SIEG.F> allied with Schneider SA <SCHN.PA>subsidiary Jeumont-Schneider, Sweden's Telefon AB LM Ericsson<ERIC.ST> allied with Matra <MATR.PA> and Bouygues SA<BOUY.PA>, Italy's <Italtel>, and Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd<NTL.TO>.

TAFT <TFB> STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almostthree points today as its vice chairman and an investment groupproposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.    However, several arbitragers said they would shy away fromthe stock at its current price levels since it is unclear howhigh bidding for the company would go and whether the companywould agree to a takeover.    "There are too many uncertainties," said one arbitrager.    Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.    Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett CapitalInc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating theywere committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast companyand were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150dlrs per share.    The company responded that the proposal would be submittedto the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet beenmade on a sale of the company.    "Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs pershare)," said one arbitrager.    Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at currentlevels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per sharerange. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this levelwould be chancy since it will take a long time for anytransaction to be completed because of regulatory approvalsnecessary for the broadcast properites.    Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billiondlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejectedthe bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternativessuch as restructuring.    Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,which has two large shareholders in an investment group led byRobert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American FinancialCorp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50years ago, has about 12 pct.    Lindner last week told the Securities and ExchangeCommission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.    "I could see if things got really crazy that it might gofor 175 (dlrs per share)," said one arbitrager, but hespeculated it probably would not even be taken over for morethan a price in the 160s.    Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but hespeculated the investor would not really be interested inrunning the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.    Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, saidhe had speculated the company might be considering a leveragedbuyout.    "Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy allthe interests involved," he said, adding the two largestshareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.    He said the highest takeover price he calculated for thecompany has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highestestimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said thelatter would be based on more optimistic expectations for thebroadcast industry. Reuter

PAPER SAYS U.S. MAY SEEK TO CURB FOREIGN TAKEOVERS The Reagan administration willconsider curbing foreign takeovers of security-sensitiveindustries such as semiconductors and computers, the New YorkTimes said, quoting an unnamed senior administration official.

"Everybody wants an open investment policy, but there haveto be some exceptions for the national interest," Baldrige wasquoted as saying.

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS More U.S. And European firms will befalling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash andeager to extend their reach further overseas, according tomerger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters.    Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S.Banks, steel and other businesses.    In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> -- Japan'sbiggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for <FairchildSemiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which suppliescomponents for supercomputers.    Nomura Securities Co Ltd <NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities CoLtd <DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seekinga niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while thecountry's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseasbanking, the takeover specialists said.    Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporatingin the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, allhave foreign businesses on their shopping lists.    Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the mostpressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big automakers they subcontract for as these move offshore.    "The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy uppotential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. --Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal," atakeover specialist at one trading company said.    Japanese companies have become among the world's richestafter a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbedagainst the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.    But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs ofJapan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move intoits traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth,the specialists said.    Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect morebarriers against Japanese exports.    Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoidthe gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work.Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer littleinvestment opportunity.    "Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, butthe recent economic factors have become a driving force," said abanking industry source.    So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.    While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number inthe thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies havetotalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.    Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japaneseacquisition activity was originally expected five years fromnow, but that time span appeared now to be too long.    Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.    A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and ChemicalsInc's <DIAC.T> takeover bid for <Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S.Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, headded.    Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bidfor the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entirebusiness after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate allbut its graphic arts-related businesses.    Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned uponby the Japanese, the trading company official says. "Japanesepeople don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicabledeals." But now after some experience overseas, Japanesecompanies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. "This isa healthy progression."    However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run theboard meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.    "Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing alarge U.S. Or European corporation," one banker said. "They willexpand their operations only gradually, a typical way forJapanese business."    A foreign merchant banker also noted, "There are not manymega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the bigdeals there have already been done."    But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets ofJapanese companies, the specialists said.    Japanese will be aiming for new businesses inhigh-technology areas. "Japanese companies had used technologyand quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviatefrom that trend," one takeover specialist said.

AFG <AFG>, WAGNER/BROWN BID FOR GENCORP <GY> <General Partners>, controlled byprivately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, saidit has started a tender offer for all common shares of GenCorpInc and associated defensive preferred share purchase rightsfor 100 dlrs a share.    GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at90.50 dlrs a share, up two dlrs on the day.    In a newspaper advertisement, General Partners said theoffer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended.    General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receiptof sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully dilutedbasis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners atleast 51 pct voting power, again fully diluted.    It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeemingthe defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied thatthe rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtainingfrom the Federal Communications Commission a special temporaryauthorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorpshares.    General Partners said it would set up voting trustarrangements pending review of its long-form application forFCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp'sbroadcasting subsidiary.    The partnership said the offer is further conditioned onGenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend thecompany's articles of incorporation and code of regulations toprovide for an increase in authorized common shares, aclassified board of directors and the elimination of cumulativevoting.  The latter two changes would make it harder forminority shareholders to elect directors.    General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for itsshareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.    GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making thevalue of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.    Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire<Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew theoffer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of theTax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went privatefor 1.66 billion dlrs.    GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospaceas well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to itstwo television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase itfailed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreignpayments and political contributions.    GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area televisionstation WOR to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its LosAngeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.An investor group challenging the Los Angeles license wouldalso receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney.

The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that onlyone private company should enter the market.    The two consortiums, <International Digital CommunicationsPlanning Inc> (IDC) and <International Telecom Japan> (ITJ),were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly <Kokusai DenshinDenwa Co> (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985.    Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministrywanted only one competitor for the time being because of thesize of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreigninvestors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.    He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the mergedconsortium at less than three pct and added that even thelargest shareholders could own only some five pct .    Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house <C. Itoh andCo.> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium whilePacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. <MER.N> jointlyhold 13 pct .

Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from GeneralPartners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value ofGenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertaintysurrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges toGencorp broadcasting licenses.

Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issuemight be a stumbling block or result in a long period of timefor any transaction.    A source close to General Partners, however, said GeneralPartners would apply to the Federal Communications Commissionfor special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.The source said if approved, the authority would allow atransaction to be carried out.    If it received the "short-form" approval, General Partnerswould set up a trust which would hold the broadcastingproperties until the licensing situation is resolved.    General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner andBrown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.    Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such asGeneral Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution ofthe challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sellthe stations.    GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with WaltDisney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to agroup that challenged the station's license.    GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV inSecaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.    General Partners said it intends to keep the company'splastics and industrial products businesses and its tires andrelated products segment.    Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, saidthat, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth asmuch as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospacebusiness could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billiondlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs pershare, he said.    The company, formerly known as General Tireand Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would beworth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottlingbusiness might also be worth several dollars per share, hesaid.    Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, whobecame chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company'sAerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over theyears and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.    "The management's doing a very fine job in trying to dealwith the non-strategic assets of the company," Rose said.    Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, butthey declined to predict what steps the company might take.They said it would be possible the company might consider aleveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.    General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and therewas some concern about "greenmail." Greenmail is the payment ata premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.    "I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothingsurprises me anymore," said Rose.    GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retainedFirst Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.    Reuter

AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlracquisition of Gelco Corp's <GEC> Canadian unit hasdramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry,largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, companyofficials and analysts said.    State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's secondlargest overnight courier business just two months afteranother Canadian company, <Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved theacquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from NewJersey-based Purolator Courier Corp <PCC>.    But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted byfinancial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companiesand likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying outforeign owned courier operations.    "It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people atthe right time," McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analystTony Hine commented.    The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S.companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-offtheir Canadian units to generate ready cash, said NesbittThomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.    "There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parentselling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either beingunder siege or taking someone else over," he said.    Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltdas part of its previously announced program to sell off fouroperating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, GelcoExpress marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters.    The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program,and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs ofdebt by year-end, the company said.    While company officials declined to disclose earnings andrevenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominantposition in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages aday and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrsa year.    The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unitformed an important part of a company restructuring program,adopted after another Canadian Company, <Unicorp Canada Corp>,acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it wouldconsider acquiring the whole company.    Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a companyformed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers ofPurolator's U.S. courier business.    For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courierbusiness represents an "excellent financial investment" in amarket it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesmanEsther Szynkarsky said.    The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake inEMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.    It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky saidthe two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, andthe two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.    She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy ofseeking attractive investments that compliment its main airlinebusiness.    Gelco will continue to operate with current management,independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada alreadyoperates its own air cargo business that includes a smalldoor-to-door courier operation.    "They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doingwell in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keepit," Szynkarsky said.    Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian unitswill likely retain operating links with their U.S. deliverynetwork, generating traffic for the former parent companieswithout them having to tie up capital in Canada.    "The nature of the business is that incremental traffic isincremental revenue," Hine said.    "It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put inplace the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuffthrough, the more money you make," he added. Reuter

FLEET <FLT> AIMS TO SPEED MERGER WITH NORSTAR Fleet Financial Group hopes itsproposed merger with Norstar Bancorp <NOR>, ranked as thelargest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginningof 1988, according to an executive of Fleet.    Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications forRhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploringthe possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger datefor the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from Julyone. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.    The merger plan was announced in a midday news release thatsaid the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would beconsummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstatebanking outside of New England come down. "If we can consummatethe deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,"Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change inthe Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any otherbanking institution in the state.    He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which onlypermits interstate banking mergers within New England, can beamended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.    If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchaseprovisions.    The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded NewYork as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbledup by the money center giants.    Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleetand Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace ofinterstate banking mergers since state legislatures begainpermitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.    Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposedmerger as "a partnership of two companies." Both will continueto operate existing headquarters after the merger.    Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each oneof theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-onesplit. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving thedeal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs.    That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-basedSecurity Pacific Corp <SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion<RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, isworth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs.    Chemical New York Corp's <CHL> acquisition of TexasCommerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billiondlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainerdeal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co <WFC>and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrsand there have been several bank mergers in the southeastvalued in the 700-800 mln dlr range.    "It's a merger of equals," said analyst John Rooney ofMoseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value atthe end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's bookvalue was 28.02 dlrs.    Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He saidKiernan would probably head the combined company until hisretirement then Murray could assume the top post.    Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co saidFleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986on the basis of the merger terms announced today.    He noted that Fleet has a "teriffic reputation" afterhaving diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet hasestablished consumer banks in the southeast and is known as aninnovator in securitization of mortgages.    The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billiondlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstaroperates in most of New York state but not in New York City.    Lougee said at some point in the future banking operationsthat both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine wouldbe combined.    The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a"lock-up" option designed to deter other acquirers. Eachgranted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissuedshares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted sharesoutstanding. Reuter

It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrsfrom the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or itsaffiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes.    In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds,which was included in the SEC filing, General Partnersofficials said they were "confident of our ability to promptlyobtain the remaining funding as described in our offermaterials."

TALKING POINT/AMERICAN EXPRESS <AXP> American Express Co's plan to sell astake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be aprelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,analysts said.    American Express earlier said it has a generalunderstanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.    The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,as investors speculated on the possibility of more investmentin the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.    The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response tothe relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents aprice of 2.7 times book value.    Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insidertrading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8times book value.    American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. Forthe last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors ofa spinoff of part of Shearson.    Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit willbenefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasinglyimportant Tokyo financial markets.    "I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step," saidLong.    "What you will see probably in the future is AmericanExpress selling an additional 17 pct in the public market andhave a public vehicle for Shearson," Long said.    "Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitmentinto an illiquid situation," he said of Nippon.    Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake inShearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, likeother investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.    American express has said the total employees of shearsonwill expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, thatnumber is substantially lower than growth last year, a companyspokesman said.    American Express officials would not comment beyond astatement made this morning. That statement, however, did notclose off the possibility of a public offering or other optionfor Shearson.    David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possibleShearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believesthe firm will digest the Nippon investment first.    "I think they'll figure out what they're going to do withthe money they have," he said.    Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also saidAmerican Express could determine to sell shares to the public.    In its statement, the financial services giant said it iscontinuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition tothe investment by Nippon.    American Express said options under study range fromexpanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competitionto broadening its access to capital.    American Express also said the options reflect thecontinuing integral role of Shearson in American Express'worldwide financial services strategy.    Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding aJapanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake toSumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.    Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.    "Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. Theydon't have the money. There's just not enough internal capitalgrowth," said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows otherU.S. brokerage companies.    Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, areinterested in the expertise of American brokers. "Those(Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies havethe capital needs and the growth opportunities to use themoney. That's a nice marriage," he said.    Morgan Stanley and Co <MS> rose 4-1/4 to 74-7/8. FirstBoston Corp <FBC> was up one to 51-1/4. E.F. Hutton Group <EFH>rose 1-1/4 to 41-1/8, and PaineWebber Group <PWJ> climbed 7/8to 37-3/4.

SWISS BANKER WANTS BOND RATINGS, SHARE DISCLOSURE A top Swiss banker called for anobligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds andsaid he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a companyshould be made to declare their share.    In comments at a news conference of <Vontobel Holding AG>,chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks'own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board,to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in.    A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swissfranc market and a debate on the use of registered shares toprevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers.    Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to themarket with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which werereadily available to professionals through specialisedinformation systems.    "We should make this classification obligatory and publishit in places that are easily accessible to lay people," he said.The quick changing nature of the financial market meant theseratings should also be continually updated, he said.    Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies,worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered sharesand participation certificates rather than bearer shares.    However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. Therecent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG <JACZ.Z> to take over HeroConserven Lenzburg <HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someonewho was not eligible according to the company's statutes.    Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do notcarry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle ofgreater democracy in the new share law before Parliament.    "People buying, for example, more than five pct of acompany's shares should be made to declare their purchase," hesaid. REUTER

ITALY SETS RULES FOR COMPANY HOLDINGS IN BANKS Companies will henceforth be able to ownstakes in banks, but these should not constitute a "dominant"holding, an Italian government committee ruled.    The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings,headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decisionreflected the "need to safeguard the principle of separationbetween banks and non-financial concerns."    It did not quantify what might constitute a "dominant"holding.    The committee also set conditions for the allocation ofcredits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes inthem, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italycould exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes heldby banks in companies or other banks.    Under the ruling, credits given by banks or theirsubsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or moreof the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits.    The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifthof the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself ortwo-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by thegroup or individual concerned.    Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concernsin which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreignbanks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks tosubsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also beexcluded from the conditions.    The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules intheir statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holdingfive pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privilegedtreatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.    With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank ofItaly can exercise supervisory controls when information on abank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in acompany or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly orindirectly.    Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake heldis below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest.    The controls will not be exercised in cases where the valueof the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of twopredefined limits.    These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of thetotal assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank. REUTER

JAPAN, BRITAIN DISAGREE ON TELECOM MERGER Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> isresisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunicationsfirms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force achange in those plans, a company executive said.    Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one ofthe two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its shareto three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategyJonathan Solomon told reporters.    That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerfulbusiness organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of thePost and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm ofprotest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreignfirms from a meaningful position in the market.    Pacific Telesis Group <PAC.N> of the United States alsoholds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia,<International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC).    Solomon said that both British Prime Minister MargaretThatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz havewritten to the Japanese government about the planned merger.    A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have alsoexpressed opposition to the merger, he said.    The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated againthat it sees no need for two competitors to <Kokusai DenshinDenwa Co Ltd>, which holds a monopoly on international callsfrom Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreignshareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm.    In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today metFumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrangethe merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked.    At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibreoptic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of itsglobal network.    "C and W wants to start right away on the project, such asapplication and other procedures," said Watanabe, who is alsochairman of <Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc>. The Japaneseside is saying that the decision on such a plan should be leftwith the new firm, after the merger.    "These decisions (on the merger) were made in considerationof Japan's economic conditions and legal systems. I told him weare not a colony or something," said Watanabe. Reuter

CHEMLAWN CORP, ECHOLAB INC SIGN DEFINITIVE MERGER A Total food aid needs in 69 of theleast developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirmentsfell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, theU.S. Agriculture Department said.    In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, thedepartment said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was arecord high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.    However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened bydrought-reduced crops and civil strife.    Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheatconsumption for food to a new high, and higher yieldingvarieties have been particularly effective where spring wheatis a common crop, it said.    However, may developing countries in tropical climates,such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and CentralAmerica, are not well adapted for wheat production, andimproved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, thedepartment said.    World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in1986/87 for the third straight year.    Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oilconsumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the departmentsaid. Reuter

AUSTRALIAN OFFER FOR SAN MIGUEL SHARES Diversified investment company, <AriadneAustralia Ltd>, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln sharesin the Philippine brewing firm <San Miguel>, a Manila newspaperreported.    The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday toPresident Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New ZealanderBruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pctof the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from thegovernment.    The presidential office and Ariadne representatives inManila were not available for comment on the report.    The shares are the entire block seized by the governmentfrom the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion thatthe real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman ofSan Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed presidentFerdinand Marcos.    The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14mln class B shares.    Government officials have said earlier that the morevaluable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners.    The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price atwhich the Philippine Social Security System suggested it mightbuy eight mln class A shares last week.    "Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of thePhilippines' yearly budget," Ariadne's Philippine agent DomingoPanganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.    "Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make hiscorporation's management expertise available to San Miguel sothat the company's assets can be fully utilised."    San Miguel, the country's largest brewer, is also one ofthe major manufacturers of grocery lines.    Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tapfood and liquor distribution lines in Australia, Britain, theU.S., New Zealand and Hong Kong through <Barwon Farmlands Ltd>,a listed Australian firm in which it has 30 pct equity.    Ariadne, with about one billion dlrs in assets and turnoverof about two billion, has interests also in mining, real estateand agricultural products. REUTER
AUSTRALIAN PLANS PHILIPPINE BRANCH FOR TAKEOVER The Australia based <AriadneAustralia Ltd>, plans to set up a branch in the Philippines tofulfill a prerequisite for the takeover of the Philippinebrewing firm, <San Miguel Corp>, a Hong Kong newspaper said.    The Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted a spokesman ofAustralian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that <BarwonFarmlands Ltd>, a listed Australian firm of which Ariadne ownsa 30 pct stake, is planning a branch in the Philippines.    He added Jacksons is arranging an offer by Barwon to pay atotal 3.8 billion pesos in cash for 38 mln San Miguel shares.    Barwon is offering 100 pesos each for 24 mln class A SanMiguel shares and 14 mln class B stock. But the Jacksonsspokesman noted that the more valuable A stock would only besold to Filipinos or companies registered in the Philippines.    He said Barwon has approached the Philippine governmentwhich seized the block of shares from the United CoconutPlanters Bank, which is believed to be linked with thecountry's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.    He added he expects a deal to be concluded between Barwonand the Philippine Government in 14 days as it is the onlyoffer in cash, the newspaper reported.    Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumoursthat <Neptunia Corp>, a Hong Kong registered company whichcontrolled by San Miguel's president Andres Soriano, is theother party keen on the block of San Miguel shares.    The Philippine's Commission on Good Government ruled lastMay against a move of Neptunia to acquire 33 mln San Miguelshares controlled by the brewery firm's former chairman EduardoCojuangco, who is also chairman of United Coconut.    Commissioner Ramon Diaz said at the time the governmentwould not allow a subsidiary to buy into a parent firm, addingSan Miguel could have offered the shares to other parties.    The Manila newspaper Sunday Times published a letter sentyesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman,New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalentto five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the sharesfrom the government.

DART GROUP FLEXIBLE ON SUPERMARKETS <SGL> BID <Dart Group Corp> said it toldSupermarkets General Corp <SGL> it was flexible on the price itwould pay to acquire the company.    Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGLshare if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders.    SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited.    In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it wasdenied confidential information on SGL that would be given toother potential bidders.    SGL officials could not be reached for comment.    Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for thesale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers,but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access toSGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with keyemployees.    "We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyoutfirms," said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGLmanagement may be considering a leveraged buyout.    Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on afriendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate allthe terms of its offer.    Dart said SGL representatives said the company has notreceived any other offer.    It said it requested the confidential information to betterunderstand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to signan agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL withoutSGL's approval.    The agreement would also have limited its ability to buySGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditionsunreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendlytransaction, it said.    Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares.    Dart said it requested the information before its meetingwith SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hoperepresentatives would reach an agreement.    It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was toldthere were certain issues important to SGL management and whilethey were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to takethem into account in putting together its package.    It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mlndlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vicepresident James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine.    Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers'severance agreements, although there was an implication thatLieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of theirown volition.    Dart said under their present agreements, none of theseofficers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also,Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management'sincentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a costof six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the sharesunless waived by the company's compensation committee.    Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for topmanagement's supplemental retirement plan.    Dart said another issue was to agree to future severanceobligations and future salary guarantees for top management,estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligationsunder the company's present policy.    Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed todiscuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try tonegotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL.    Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chainand Rickels home centres.    Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filedby an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking suchactions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence.    The suit also sought to have directors carry out theirfiduciary duty.    Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by anunwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue ofsecurities to shareholders which make a takeover moreexpensive. REUTER

SOSNOFF HAS SMALL NUMBER OF CAESARS <CAW> SHARES Martin T. Sosnoff said his <MTSAcquisition Corp> to date has received only a "negligible"number of Caesars World Inc shares in response to its 28-dlr-per-share tender offer for all shares.    Sosnoff also said he has held preliminary talks with PrattHotel Corp <PRAT> and Southmark Corp <SM> on forming a jointventure to enter into talks to acquire Caesars in a friendlytransaction in which Sosnoff would have a 50 pct interest andPratt and Southmark the remainder.    Sosnoff said the talks with Pratt and Southmark are notbeing actively pursued at the presentand may or may not becontinued in the future.  He said there could be no assurancethat a joint venture would be formed or that Caesars wouldagreed to talks.  "Several preliminary contacts withrepresentatives of Caesars have not resulted in any indicationthat it wishes to enter into such negotiations," Sosnoff said.    He said based on talks with staff members of gamingauthorities, there can be no assurance that the necessaryregulatory review of its bid for Caesars World can be completedby the original April Three expiration date.    Sosnoff said it has extended the tender until May 15.  Thebid remains subject to regulatory approvals and the arrangementof financing.    Pratt, which owns the Sands Hotel and Casino in AtlanticCity, N.J., where Caesars operates the Boardwalk Regency Hoteland Casino, recently waged an apparently unsuccessful campaignto acquire control of Resorts International Inc <RTA> againstNew York developer Donald Trump.

TALKING POINT/WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL <WEN> Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy'sInternational Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took thefizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interestedsuitor.    Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and losta point when Coca Cola <KO> said the rumors were untrue.However, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of morethan three mln shares.    Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet theysaid they could not conclude a takeover of the fast foodrestaurant chain was impossible.    Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds.Yet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of aBusiness Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitorand which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.    Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc <BUD> andPepsico Inc <PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neitherof those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy'sofficial.    "It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, butits not unusual for us to be linked with those companies," saidDenny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.    However, Lynch would not comment specifically on thecurrent market rumors.    Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had beenskeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated itviews fast food chains as customers and does not want to becomea competitor to them.    "I can't put another name on it," said Kidder peabodyanalyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold upWendy's stock. "It very well could be someone's interested."    But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right timefor Wendy's to be sold.    "They're obviously having operational difficulties. I'vealways believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (anoffer), but I can't believe this is the right price at theright time," Freedman said.    "If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to controlthe situation," Freedman said.    "I just don't think there's anything going on. I don'tthink it's worth much more than where it is," said Joseph Doyleof Smith Barney.    Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the "burgerwars" between itself, McDonald's Corp <MCD> and Pillsbury Co's<PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast foodhamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same storesales last year, analysts said.    Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-pricedbreakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Someanalysts said the company should be bringing in new products,but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.    There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may bevulnerable to a takeover.    James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company hasimproved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a highpercent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.    "They also have some attractive leaseholds on theirrestaurants," Murren said.    Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in thefourth quarter. "That was about the first time in sevenquarters," he said.    Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something couldbe going on with Wendy's. "My gut feeling is something's goingto happen. I don't know what," she said.    She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrsper share.    One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitorbecause Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains insteadof Pepsi.    Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought byPepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said.Pepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants. Reuter

NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlrpurchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Incbrokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurersare likely to follow, securities analysts said.    The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage housesis likely to pay off in dollars and international marketposition, they said. "It's part of a trend towards growingcapital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreignfinancial institutions," said Simon Smithson, an analyst withKleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm describedby some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will giveNippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions onWall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of itsassets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in businesssectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory assetmanagement, market research, and consulting on financing.    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and theworld's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve thedeal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese lifeinsurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japaneseinsurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocksand sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets andinstruments.    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official wasappointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co'sboard and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become alimited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller andproblem-plagued banks in 1984. "But now Japanese are going forblue-chip organisations," he said.    "It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturingindustries," said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. "With ahistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan."    Competition in fund management has grown along with greaterJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mlnyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17to 18 pct, he said.    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas andgain experience with financial instruments which are likely tospread to Japan with further deregulation. "The high regulatoryenvironment has delayed (life insurance firms')diversification. Now there's a growing number of new productsin an environment of increasing competition for performance onfund management," Smithson said. REUTER

"It's a case of ChemLawn euphoria," said one arbitrageur,referring to a recent hostile tender that began at 27 dlrs pershare and ended when ChemLawn Corp <CHEM> found a white knightwilling to bid 36.50 dlrs.    For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemedlike an "appropriate price." Another said "it's too early toproject the outcome."    "The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlroffer is inadequate," the second arbitrageur said. But he addedit was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much morethan the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.    He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens andthere could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac isable to thwart Mark IV.    Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its boardstudies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said itwould make a recommendation by April 17.    A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved inseveral takeovers previously and has proven itself to be adetermined bidder. "They're not beginners," he said.    Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to findanother buyer. "It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,"he said. "There is only a small universe of people who wouldwant to own the company as it's presently structured."    Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software,aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, weldingequipment and other products.    "I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest forthose who can take the risk," said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst atMilwaukee Co.

BORG-WARNER SAYS IT DISCUSSED POSSIBLE TAKEOVER WITH IRWI The United States may soon ease its1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringingforward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for thefourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressmanrepresenting sugar growers told Reuters in an interview.    Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the Housesubcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated theeasing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern aboutthe impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year.    "With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to onemln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbeancountries and the Philippines," Huckaby said.    By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, thequota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons.    Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the thirdquarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the Septemberto December period "we could get away without having toincrease the quota."    He noted that some in the sugar industry believe anincrease in the quota is justified.    Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugarrefiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials torequest a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refinerssaid the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictivethere could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S laterthis year, a refiner spokesman said.    However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that itwould consider the request.    Following the refiners' request, representatives of theFlorida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express oppositionto any quota expansion, industry sources said.    The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from asugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect ofthe current sugar program, indicates at least some growerofficials are concerned enough to support an easing of theimport quota, industry officials said.    Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by theReagan administration's interagency sugar policy group.    Asked about possible quota changes, A USDA official said"As far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota yearis not under active consideration." Reuter

MERGERS, PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS Automobile dealerships have becomelarge, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.    Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers andbuyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that thelargest are considering offering shares to the public, analystssay.    Retail car sales "are at a point of transition. There's notmuch that's off the table in terms of creative thinking" aboutways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the Universityof Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.    The retail car market is "much more freeform now" than itwas in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroitanalyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.    Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.Dealerships sold one kind of car--a "Chevy" or a Ford or aStudebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the NationalAutomobile Dealers Association.    That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's VolkswagenBeatle--began to gain popularity. The "Bug" caused "arebellion" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom fromrestrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,says Jauppi.    One of the most visible changes in retail car sales hasbeen in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-foldincrease from 1956--and employed 34 workers.    "I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mlndlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,"says Cole.    "There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than thatmake cars," he says.    With the increase in size, large dealers have been buyingup other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trendwill let up.    Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800principal owners today.    Many dealers are experimenting with owning severalfranchises, some of which might compete against each other. "Itused to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now aChevrolet dealer might handle several lines," Jauppi says.    As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking aboutthe possibility that some of them might become publicly-ownedor open international operations.    Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,"are obviously thinking of very seriously," says Cole.    Although some say the franchise system might get in the wayof a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles totrading in car dealer shares.    "Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thingthe manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells thosecars. It could happen any time," Jauppi says.    "If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at thescale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard toresist taking them public," said another analyst.    And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to becomeinternational.    "We're going to have international dealers--dealer networksthat are worldwide," he says. U.S. dealers will be attractedparticularly to Europe, where the market will expand fasterthan the U.S., he says.    "It's not totally off the wall," says Cole. Reuter

FERRUZZI DEAL WITH CPC WORTH 630 MLN DLRS The Ferruzzi Group's holding companyAgricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the Europeancorn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under theagreement reached in principle between the two companies, astatement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said.    When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, itsaid only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs.    Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on severalclauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.    It said the deal would involve 13 starch factoriesemploying about 5,000 people in eight European Communitycountries plus facilities and commercial operations in other ECstates.    The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, orabout one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes ofcereals.    Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extendits presence in the European agro-industrial industry bothgeographically and in terms of products.    It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugarand of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader.    It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximumquotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and saidit foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch inthe future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.

DIXONS SAID IT GOT AND ACCEPTED ONLY 20 PCT OF CYCLOPS SHARES I London's rise as a trading centre forU.S. Government debt has been spurred by the increasing use ofinterest rate swaps, which are now arranged for most new issuesin the eurobond markets, traders and analysts said.    Indeed, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of allnew debt issued here last year -- over 186 billion dlrs worth-- was part of either an interest rate or currency swap.    "The U.S. Treasuries market here is swap-driven," said DavidJones, vice president at Goldman Sachs and Co international andhead of its U.S. Government bond trading desk.    "It is commonplace to have trades of 100 mln dlrs or more in10-years, seven years or five years, all related to an interestrate swap or hedging of a eurobond deal," Jones said at a recentconference on the U.S. Treasuries market.    Just a year or so ago, he said, trades of that size goingthrough brokers screens in London were unthinkable.    Traders said that over the past two weeks, while trading inU.S. Treasuries has been almost frozen by indecision over thedirection of interest rates, swap-related deals have providedthe sole source of new business.    Dealers said that last week, a 260 mln dlr trade involvingtwo and 10-year Treasuries was transacted on brokers' screens.    The trade, they said, was swap related.    There are no firm figures on exactly how much U.S. Treasurydebt is traded here and estimates vary widely.    But Wrightson Economics, a U.S.-based research firm whichdrew its data from U.S. Treasury reports, estimated that grosstransactions in U.S. Government securities in London rose to341 billion dlrs in the first nine months of 1986 alone,against 188 billion in all of 1985.    Wrightson estimates that about 20 pct of all U.S. Treasurytrading is transacted outside the U.S., With Tokyo forming thethird major centre.    And while figures are not yet available for the lastquarter, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the trendcontinued, traders say.    Richard Lacy, chief executive at Exco International, putaverage daily Treasuries trading volume in London at about 15billion dlrs. Exco recently purchased an 80 pct interest in RMJSecurities inc, one of the four major brokers in U.S.Government bonds which has offices in London, New York andTokyo.    But Dick Van Splinter, president of RMJ's competitor,Fundamental Brokers Inc's London operations, estimates averagedaily turnover is no more than four to five billion dlrs.    But even at the low range of estimates, Treasuries tradingvolume is at least equal to that in the U.K.'s own governmentbonds, known as gilts.     Jeremy Ford, vice president at Bankers Trust InternationalLtd, explained that U.S. Treasuries are used by intermediariesin swap transactions to lock in the "spread," the differencebetween the interest rate the borrower has to pay and the ratethat the counterparty is obliged to pay.    But even beyond swap-related activity, dealers said thenature of trading in London has changed.    "The interesting thing our figures show is the transition inLondon from a marketing effort to a trading effort," said LouisCrandall, an economist at Wrightson who has been collecting thedata.    Crandall said that previously, firms' activities werelimited to trying to sell U.S. Securities to Europeaninvestors. Now, however, they appear increasingly willing actas principal in transactions rather than acting on behalf oftheir New York offices.    Increasingly, traders say, firms maintain separate profitand loss sheets for their London operations so that tradingdecisions can be made independently from the U.S. Headquarters.    Many of the major U.S. Firms, including Merrill Lynch andCo, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc and Chemical Bank trade fortheir own accounts here.    Also, traders point out, the number of U.S. Firms operatingin London has increased sharply over the past year, as has thenumber of European and Asian banks which trade U.S. Governmentsecurities.    Within the past few months, NationalWestminster Bank Plc's County Bank subsidiary and Swiss BankCorp have applied to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York tobecome primary dealers in U.S. Government securities and theirLondon offices have just recently received direct-dealingbrokers screens.    And Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, already a primary dealer, ispreparing to open a U.S. Treasuries trading desk in London.    Dick Van Splinter, president of Fundamental Brokers Inc,the largest of the four major government bond brokers here,said he now has 45 firms using direct-dealing screens, up from35 a year ago. REUTER

ALLIED-SIGNAL INC TO SELL LINOTYPE GROUP TO COMMERZBANK OF WEST Energy Secretary John Herrington hasproposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he saidall would cost the Treasury money and will come under closeWhite House scrutiny before action is taken.    One measure he said he favored would raise the depletionallowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well asproduction using enhanced extraction methods.    Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending thetax code, but would look at the proposal.    Herrington's proposals to spur production were made alongwith the release last week of the energy department's report onenergy and the national security.    The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damagingimplications for national security.    He has said since in speeches and at news conferences thatany plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil productionwould have to meet three criteria--increase production, notcause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.    Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,spurring production but fail the second and third.    He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oilprices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwideand cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.    A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteriaby not increasing domestic production.    In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remainsfirmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.    Options which meet Herrington's criteria include:    - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults byborrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that ifoil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults thatcould cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.    - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. Itwould raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.    - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysicalexpenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels aday, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.    - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage tospur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre forthe typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lowerthe cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.    Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administrationproposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cutthe need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.    He also called again for Congressional approval to exploreoff the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billionbarrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, whichmay hold nine billion barrels.    Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of theseproposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/securitystudy would make a strong case for the need to help thestruggling domestic oil industry.    Another move Herrington said he will press anew, eventhough it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is toraise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.    This, he said, would further bolster national security incase of an oil-supply disruption.    Reuter

TWA SOLD FOUR MLN SHARES OF USAIR BELIEVED TO INSTITUTIONS, WALL STREET A leading U.S. farm-stateCongressman, Jerry Huckaby, D-La., warned he will press nextyear for legislation to control domestic production ofsweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industryfails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.    "We're moving toward a direction where we couldself-destruct (the U.S. sugar program)," Rep. Huckaby, chairmanof the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugarissues, told Reuters in an interview.    Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this yearthey must halt production increases, said he will deliver thesame message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He alsosaid he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.    Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domesticsweetener output increases is an effort to forestall furthercuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.    "I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota)another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the pointwhere the program might not work," he said.    "Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,"said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.    A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about thecurrent level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of theU.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar importsholding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.    A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be madeuntil 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.    "I feel like if we didn't expand production, we couldprobably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least throughthe 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),"Huckaby said.    However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrupproducers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetenermarket from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.    He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners willcapture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market inthe U.S.    But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in theproduction of a new crystalline corn sweetener which furtherexpanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar importsmight be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.    Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refinercompanies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.    "This program is advantageous to the corn users. They havesome natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that theprogram is preserved," Huckaby said.    Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives tothink about how domestic output could be controlled, eitherthrough production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.    Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from theJustice Department to determine if it would be legal to askcorn refiners to limit production.    "I don't know if we will go this route, but if we dothere's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you dothat legally?" he said.    Asked if he would proceed with production controls withoutthe support of corn refiners, Huckaby said "You build a fragilehouse if you do it that way."    Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmershave expanded production, because high sugar price supportmeans returns from sugar are higher than competing crops suchas soybeans and grain.    But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion wouldnot be good policy.    Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches tosugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, theymay be penalized retroactively under any production controllegislation passed next year.    Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes inthe sugar program this year despite a Reagan administrationproposal to drastically slash the program.    "The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don'tthink it will get up a head of steam," Huckaby said.    He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar pricesupport is unlikely to be approved.    Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program,Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaintwith the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against theEuropean Community's sugar policy. He said EC policies are themajor cause of the depressed world sugar market. Reuter

CYCLOPS CORP REFORMS BOARD AFTER DIXONS GROUP FAILS TO GET MAJORITY OF CYCLO Britain has decided to resist U.S.pressure and retain powers to withdraw tax credits from U.S.parent companies based in states which impose unitary taxes onthe worldwide profits of foreign-owned firms, TreasuryFinancial Secretary Norman Lamont told Parliament.    But he added that the eventual use of those powers wouldnot be backdated if activated before the end of 1988.    The U.K. Government has consistently opposed the use ofunitary taxation of international business on grounds they arecontrary to internationally accepted principles, laid down bythe United Nations and the OECD, Treasury sources said.    In a written parliamentary answer, Lamont said "in themeantime, progress towards a final resolution of the unitarytax issues will be kept under careful review" by Britain.    "Should it be necessary to take action ... Before December31, 1988, it will not apply to dividends paid before the dateof the announcement of such action. If it is necessary to takeaction thereafter, it will not apply to dividends on or beforeDecember 31, 1988," Lamont said.    The Reagan Administratian published draft legislation latein 1985 to limit states use of unitary taxation to the profitsmade inside the U.S., Known as the "water's edge" method.    In response to that draft legislation, Britain agreed todefer initiating action under its Finance Act 1985 - but onlyon the understanding that legislation to resolve the unitarytax issue would be made law and take effect from end-December1986.    Then the U.S. Administration said in September 1986 that ithad decided not to pursue Federal legislation, in view of thepassing of legislation in California.    Britain, however, considers the California legislationunsatisfactory, not least because U.K. Business will have topay a fee for the right of not being assessed by the unitarytax method, government sources said.

U.S. SECURITIES GROUP BACKS INSIDER RESTRAINTS The Securities Industry Associationbacked a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostilecorporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insidertrading in law.    The industry trade association called on U.S. securitiesfirms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets toguard against illegal trading by employees.    The association also backed broad federal restrictions on avariety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.    But it said investment banking firms should be allowed tocontinue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisitionactivities so long as those functions were kept separate.    The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board ofdirectors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federalSecurities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stockexchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.    The report said securities firms "should be more rigorous inrestricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis."    It said firms should train their employees to understandthe need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information.    It said legislation to define insider trading should avoidexpanding current law in a way that would impede the market.    It said an insider trading definition should exempt asecurities firm from liability for law violations by itsemployees unless the firm had participated in or was aware ofthe wrongdoing.    In the mergers and acquisitions area, the associationadvocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeoverprotection plans without prior shareholder approval.    It said a group or individual buying up a company's stockshould be required to file a public disclosure statement beforeacquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. Undercurrent law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days afterexceeding the five pct limit.    The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of acompany's voting stock shouls be made only through a tenderoffer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is nolimit on open market purchases.    The group said the federal government should preempt stateregulation of defensive takeover tactics.    The group said all tender offers should remain open for atleast 30 calendar days.    The current requirement is expressed in business days.    It said so-called "lockup" devices, in which securities areissued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fendoff an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of thetarget company's total common stock.

FED APPROVES CHEMICAL BANK ACQUISITION OF TEXAS COMMERCE BA Standard and Poor's Corp said itdowngraded six U.S. money center bank holding companies,affecting about 13.3 billion dlrs of debt securities.    They are Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB>, Chemical New York Corp<CHL>, Irving Bank Corp <V>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC>,Mellon Financial Corp <MEL> and Security Pacific Corp <SPC>.    S and P said the action on Chase, Chemical, Irving andManufacturers primarily reflected continued vulnerability tolesser developed countries and median financial performance.    Standard and Poor's said its downgrade of Chemical alsoreflected that holding company's acquisition of Texas CommerceBancshares <TCB>, which was just now approved by the FederalReserve.    For Mellon and Security Pacific, S and P cited highernon-performing assets and weaker operating earnings.    The rating agency said it completed a review, based on 1986results, of the largest U.S. bank holding companies. It paidspecial attention to reassessing the effect of exposures tolesser developed countries on the holding companies' earningsand capital.    "Brazil's unilateral moratorium on debt service paymentsunderscored the potential for polarization between bankers anddebtor countries," S and P said.    S and P noted that while Argentina, Brazil, Mexico andVenezuela each face unique economic problems, the lack ofprogress toward moderating their debt service burdens has beendisappointing.    However, the agency pointed out that a substantiveimprovement in the large banks' financial positions has actedas a counter-balance to the Latin American debt situation.    Citing increasing financial strength, S and P said itaffirmed the debt ratings of Citicorp <CCI>, Bankers Trust NewYork Corp <BT>, Bank of Boston Corp <BKB> and J.P. Morgan andCo Inc <JPM>.    S and P noted that most U.S. bank holding companies havewhat it termed easily realizable capital resources available tothem, such as undervalued real estate, appreciated portfoliosecurities and overfunded pension plans.    "Most bank managements appear committed to improving thequality of their balance sheets," S and P said, noting many nowemphasize long-term strategies over short-term earnings.    Standard and Poor's reduced Chase Manhattan's senior debtto AA-minus from AA, subordinated debt to A-plus from AA-minusand preferred stock to A from A-plus. The commercial paper ofthe parent and its unit Chase Manhattan Bank of Canada wereaffirmed at A-1-plus.    Chase has 3.2 billion dlrs of debt outstanding. It has 6.4billion dlrs of loans to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico andVenezuela - one of the highest exposures to lesser developedcountries among U.S. money centers.    Chase's underlying profitability remains at median levelsbecause of its high expense structure, S and P said.    S and P cut Chemical's and the unit Chemical New YorkN.V.'s senior debt to AA-minus from AA and subordinated debt toA-plus from AA-minus.    About 1.2 billion dlrs of long-term debt was affected.    The agency cited Chemical's relatively large exposure toLatin American borrowers, particulary Brazil and Mexico,continued high levels of nonperforming assets and the pendingacquisition of Texas Commerce.    Aggregate exposure to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico andVenezuela was almost four billion dlrs at year-end 1986, or 105pct of equity and reserves, S and P pointed out.    Irving's senior debt was reduced to A-plus from AA-minus,with subordinated debt and preferred stock lowered to A fromA-plus. Its commercial paper was affirmed at A-111-1plus.    Irving has about 500 mln dlrs of debt outstanding. Itsapproximately 1.4 billion dlrs of loans to the four major Latindebtor countries account for 110 pct of year-end equity andreserves.    S and P downgraded Manufacturers Hanover's senior debt to Afrom A-plus, subordinated debt to A-minus from A and preferredstock to BBB-plus from A-minus but affirmed its A-1 commercialpaper. The bank has 3.8 billion dlrs of debt.    S and P noted that Manufacturers has about 6.7 billion dlrsof loans to the major Latin debtor nations and has experiencedweak earnings.    However, the unit CIT Group Holdings Inc's AA-minus seniordebt and A-1-plus commercial paper were affirmed.    The rating agency cut Mellon's senior debt to A-plus fromAA and preferred stock to A from AA-minus. It has 1.1 billiondlrs of debt securities.    The commercial paper programs of Mellon Bank Canada andMellon Australia Ltd, guaranteed by the parent company, werelowered to A-1 from A-1-plus.    S and P cited continued lower operating earnings and risingnonperforming assets and charge-offs for Mellon.    Security Pacific's 1.7 billion dlrs of debt was downgraded.Cut were its senior debt to AA from AA-plus, and subordinateddebt and preferred stock to AA-minus from AA.    Security Pacific Overseas Finance N.V.'s debt issues werereduced to AA from AA-plus. Affirmed were the parent's A-1-pluscommercial paper and the BBB-rated debt of the unit SecurityPacific Financial Systems.    These actions reflected Security Pacific's continued highlevels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, S and P said. Reuter
KANSAS CITY <KSU> READY TO BUY SOUTHERN PACIFIC Kansas City Southern Industries Incsaid it is ready to promptly purchase the Southern PacificTransportation Co from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp <SFX> ifthe Interstate Commerce Commission rejects Sante Fe's attemptto reopen the merger of Southern and the Atchison, Tokepa andSanta Fe Railway.    In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlinedfour conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific.    Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into anagreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilitesof Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and thatthe financial condition of Southern remain largely unchangedfrom today onward.    "We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market valueoffer in cash for the Southern Pacific," said Kansas CitySouthern president and chief executive officer Landon H.Rowland.    "This offer disproves the constant derogation of theSourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSPChief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that theSouthern Pacific was 'bankrupt,'" said Rowland.    He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achievethe benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving theindependece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing primecompetitor, Santa Fe.    Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated thevalue of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to1.2 billion dlrs.    It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon BrothersInc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in theirmerger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations.    Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer forSouthern after its books, records and properties are examined.    "Once that examination has been completed (and even in theabsence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make anoffer in writing...." said the company.    Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fehad not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission'sreconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and SouthernPacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel eachother throughout their routes.    ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger asinherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioningfor reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreementswith the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western andother railroads, adds to the value of the merger.

GENCORP <GY> BID COULD BE RAISED, GROUP SAYS An investor group said it might bewilling to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for GenCorp but sofar the company has turned down requests for a meeting.    "We might be able to see some additional value if we couldmeet" and get more financial data, said Joel Reed, speaking forthe investor group.    Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds"was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at thistime." Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephoneconversation with Reynolds, Reed said.    Wagner and Brown, along with AFG Industries Inc <AFG>,recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. Theoffer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs.    Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per sharetender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorpgained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE.    Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event hisgroup wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling andentertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. Hesaid the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may bemore viable if merged with another tire company.    "One option would be to try to grow the tire businessthrough combination or an acquisition," Reed said. He said hebelieves such a merger could create a stronger force in thetire industry.    Gary Miller, chief financial officer of AFG, said hiscompany has a record of acquiring mature businesses andboosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profitsharing have been used with success, he said.    In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations,Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp'sshoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations.    The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp theyintend to consummate sale of WOR-TV in New York to MCA Inc<MCA>. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell thestation for 387 mln dlrs.    The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they wouldalso proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles toWalt Disney Co <DIS>. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrsand Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, wouldget about 103 mln dlrs.    The partners also said the Federal CommunicationsCommission established an expedited schedule for receivingcomments on their request for special temporary authorizationof proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formalapplication for transfer of the broadcast unit.    Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedulebecause it provides time for the agency to act on the requestbefore the expiration of the tender offer.    He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quicklyas possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations.    Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced bysome municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp isheadquartered, Reed said, "the plan of the partners offers longterm growth for Ohio."    He noted that the aerospace business, slated fordivestiture under the partners' plan, is located in California."Our program is one that overall would provide the greatestlong term growth for all segments," he said.

BP says it will tender for remaining 45 pct of Standard Oil at 70 dlrs a sh China will have a budget deficit of8.017 billion yuan in calendar 1987 compared with a 7.08billion deficit in 1986, Finance Minister Wang Bingqian said.    He told the National People's Congress, the State Councilhas decided to cut nearly all 1987 budgetary expenditures by 10pct from the 1986 level. He said expenditures for the past twoyears have been inflated.    Investment by localities in capital construction in 1987must fall by 50 pct from the 1986 level and state firms mustcut their losses by 30 pct, he said.    China will use 14.6 billion yuan in foreign loans in 1987,up from 7.87 billion in 1986, Wang said.    It must cut back on investment in capital construction,especially construction outside the state plan, he said. Fundsmust go into energy, transport, telecommunications, raw andsemi-finished materials and not into non-production sectors.    "In view of the country's financial difficulties this year,it has been decided that seven billion yuan of the budgetaryallocation for capital construction will be raised by thePeople's Bank through loans and the issuing of bonds," he said.    Wang said all localities and departments must strictlyconfine their 1987 capital investment to the amount set out inthe state budget, a 50 pct reduction from 1986 levels.    He said that because of financial difficulties, the statecannot increase spending on culture, education, science andpublic health in 1987 at the same rate as over the past fewyears. Expenditure in those sectors will rise by two pct.    The only allocations not to be affected by the general 10pct cutback are subsidies for price rises, repayment ofprincipal and interest on domestic and foreign loans, funds forthe disabled and spending for other social relief.    Wang said state firms must cut their total losses by 30 pctfrom the 1986 level, overhead expenses by 10 pct and rawmaterial consumption by two pct. Commercial firms must cuttheir deficits by 20 pct and running costs by two pct.    He said violations of financial and economic discipline arecommon, including tax evasion, false accounting, embezzlement,theft, extravagance and accepting and offering bribes. Suchpractices "have reached very serious proportions in some areas,departments and units" and must be dealt with seriously, hesaid.    Wang said 11.4 billion yuan worth of foreign loans havebeen arranged according to the 1986-90 plan, with 3.2 billiongoing to pay for foreign equipment in the Baoshan steel plantnear Shanghai.    He said China is running no risk in using more foreignloans, provided it prepares careful feasibility studies,borrows only what it can repay and uses the loans only todevelop production in priority sectors.    Wang said China plans to levy new taxes on the use ofarable land for non-farm purposes starting this year. Half therevenue generated will go to the state and half to localitiesto be used in the development of agriculture.    The only new spending is 11 billion yuan to be used tocover tax reductions and increased subsidies for big andmedium-size state firms and textile and other light industries.The money will also pay for increases in the state purchasingprices of some grain, cotton and oil-yielding crops, he said.

BP TO OFFER 7.4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> said itintended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard OilCo <SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, fora total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.    The offer would be made through its <BP North America Inc>unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. Theoffer would not be conditional on any minimum number of sharesbeing tendered.    BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was basedon its own valuation as well as those of its financialadvisers. It took into account reviews of both public andnon-public information.    Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down1-3/4 dlrs.    BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p atlast night's close.    About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP'sown resources.    The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly frombanks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility andpartly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. Thecompany said it was in the course of arranging thesefacilities.    BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group'sinvestment in Standard was its largest single asset. Fullownership would enable investment and operating decisions to bemade without the limitations of a minority interest.    BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimumuse of its financial resources. It was confident oil priceswere likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify theinvestment.    Walters added that it also felt that, due to managementchanges in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully evenin a lower oil price environment.    Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrsand in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs beforetax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.    Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.One noted that it was not immediately clear why the groupshould spend so much money buying a company it alreadycontrolled.    BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standardshares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have onthe U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended todispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the1987/88 financial year, analysts said.    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson notedthat any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP woulddepend on the reaction of the markets.    The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59pct from 20 pct currently, he said.    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would notrepeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standardreturning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting fromits cash flow -- were good.    Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel tomake money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue fromproduction and its downstream activities would push itcomfortably into surplus.    BP initially took a stake in Standard following thediscovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP hadinadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crudeoil.    The analysts said that BP had promoted a major managementreorganisation of Standard in the past year.    The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard wasnow complete was one possible factor behind the timing of thetender offer, Spedding said.    BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as majorbalance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been wellreceived in the markets.    The lower costs that should now be possible -- especiallyafter the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to comestraight through to 1987 profits without being cut back byother sectors.

Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility,Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only amongBP's relationship banks.    As a result, banks were being offered lead manager statusat 200 mln dlrs, co-lead management at 125 mln and manager at75 mln.    Although pricing on many credit facilities has becomeextremely fine in recent years because of the keen competitionto win mandates, Morgan Guaranty said banks would becompensated fairly since this is a special purpose facilitywhich must be completed quickly, with signing expected in about10 days.

SIEMENS REBUTTS U.S. CRITICISM ON CGCT OFFER Siemens AG <SIEG.F> rebutted U.S.Criticism it is blocking American Telephone and TelegraphCorp's <T.N>, AT and T, entry into French telecommunicationsfirm <Compagnie Generale Constructions Telephoniques>, CGCT.    Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that theacquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T andPhilips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV <PGLO.AS> had not been decidedon two years ago as claimed by AT and T.    The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemensat the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT.The result of the negotiations was still open.    Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.    The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairmanJames E. Olson as saying that Siemens' attempt to stop AT and Tand Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in theU.S.    Baur said he expected the French government to decide onthe winning bid by the end of April. CGCT's share of the Frenchswitchboard market amounts to around 16 pct.    The French government has limited CGCT participation byforeign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francsfor the whole company.    Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to theinitial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later butsaid Siemens' aim was to introduce its technology.    Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm<Jeumont-Schneider SA> submitted a joint offer at the start ofMarch because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies willform a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT.   Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company whileJeumont-Schneider will own 80 pct. Apart from investing 100 mlnfrancs for the modernisation of CGCT, a new research centrewith was also being planned. REUTER

FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION Less than two months after FirstInterstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmericaCorp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.    In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking forways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain ourindependence, if possible."    In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the majorEast Coast banks to buy banks in California.    First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, andthe nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 westernstates and has franchise operations in four additional states.    Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target forlarge U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region.    While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, whenasked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,"That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naivenot to think that."    Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as"opportunistic".    He said he will look for banks in management trouble thathe can get at a bargain, then add management to restoreprofitability, or for banks in states where First Interstatealready operates, then cut costs by combining resources.    The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said mostof the banks are already well managed, but might be purchasedat a discount because of the depressed regional economy.    Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might movehim to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, "Wecontinue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot ofpeople continue to monitor and look at us."    Banking analysts, however, consider another FirstInterstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happenany time soon.    Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, "a very,very difficult decision."    With that decision made, however, he acknowledged FirstInterstate may now have a difficult time keeping its numberfour position in the California banking community.    "The competition in this state is tough," he said, notingCityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branchesfrom Sears Roebuck company. "CityBank is moving rapidly to moveus down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth," he said.    Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that SecurityPacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regionalcompetitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.    "Security is, has been and continues to be a highlyprofitable and obviously well managed company," he said.    He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has theadvantages of having owned and managed regional banks longerand has the recognition advantage of having given its regionalbanks a common name.    Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in goodfinancial condition, First Interstate continues to sustainserious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.    Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,he said, "I don't think it has bottomed out, because I thinkmost of the problems are real estate-related and the realestate problems are going to be with us for several years."    Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture inthe Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate'sfranchise operation.    First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer FirstInterstate financial services in ten states.    While a year ago he was considering taking his franchiseoperation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said becausemost of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion intothe Midwest must come first.    Calling the franchise system, "moderately profitable,"Pinola said, "It is going to take a rejuvenation of theagriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speedwe were generating before the last year or two."    On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only bankswith minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits. Reuter

FED'S HELLER URGES BROAD REFORM TO AID BANKING Federal Reserve Board GovernorRobert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened bypermitting formation of financial services holding companiesinvolved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate andsecurities.    In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bankand Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, "I believethat increased diversification along geographic and productlines is the key to strengthening the American banking system."    He said he supported the idea of financial services holdingcompanies advocated by the Association of Bank HoldingCompanies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiarieswould be handled on functional lines.    "Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by thebank to the associated institutions, and all transactions wouldhave to be on an arms-length basis," Heller said.    Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.    Heller said he "would require the holding company to serveas a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment tomaintain the bank's capital.    "In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail aslong as the holding company has a positive net worth."    Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permittedto own a financial services holding company, again with theprovision that capital would flow to the financial enterpriseif necessary.    Heller said the effects of these actions "would be banksthat are at least as strong as the corporations holding them" inwhich customer deposits were assured while any incentive to"loot the bank" was removed.    Such diversification would give access to national andinternational financial services to corporations across theUnited States.    Heller said that would mean "the steady decline of America'sbanks in the world financial league tables would be arrested" bypermitting them to become more competitive. Reuter

JAPAN ACTS TO COOL U.S. ANGER ON TELECOMS DISPUTE Japan has sought to assure the U.S. It isnot trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japaneseinternational telecommunications company below the legal limitof 33 pct, a Post and Telecommunications ministry officialsaid.    In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister ShunjiroKarasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that theministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S.Firms that have expressed interest.    But it does oppose any foreign internationaltelecommunications carrier having a management role, he said.    The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Oppositionto the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to competewith the current monopoly <Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd>, andto reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable andWireless Plc <CAWL.L>, industry analysts and diplomats said.    One of the rival firms, <International Telecom Japan Inc>(ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firmsincluding General Electric Co <GE>, Ford Motor Co <F> andCitibank NA <CCI), and two European companies, ITJ presidentNobuo Ito said yesterday.    Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a secondpotential KDD rival, <International Digital CommunicationsPlanning Inc>, along with <C Itoh and Co>. Merrill Lynch and CoInc <MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc <PAC>, both ofthe U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively.    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged themerger of the two firms because it says the market can onlysupport a single KDD competitor.    It has also rejected management participation by aninternational common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless,arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists.    Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, JonathanSolomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes amerger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share toless than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20pct, the ministry official said.    Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitorwould most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless'share, industry analysts said.    "Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- onecombined competitor," Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analystDarrell Whitten said.    "Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share upto a certain amount, but you won't find any one company with anextraordinarily large holding," Whitten said.    Western diplomatic sources were more blunt.    "They (the ministry) don't want to see Cable and Wirelesswith a reasonable share and they think of all sorts ofstrategies to reduce that share," one said.

The merger involves shareholders in Progressive and Rainbowboth receiving shares in a new company <Astral Pacific CorpLtd> on a one-for-one exchange basis.    The BIL bid is higher than the 4.20 dlrs BIL said it wouldoffer when it first announced on Monday it would make a fullbid for Progressive, and it follows much public debate betweenBIL and Rainbow.    BIL Chief Executive Paul Collins said last week that heopposes the Rainbow/Progressive merger because BIL seesProgressive shares as being worth twice as much as Rainbow's.BIL has not disclosed how many Progressive shares it holds.    Rainbow has said the merger is soundly based. ChairmanAllan Hawkins said last week that BIL's actions were aimed onlyat dirsrupting the merger and were not in the interests ofProgressive shareholders.    Both Rainbow's and Progressive's boards have approved themerger proposal. It has also been approved by the CommerceCommission, but BIL's bid is still subject to the Commission'sscrutiny.

INVESTOR PAUL BILZERIAN HAS 7.2 PCT PAY 'N PAK STAKE, MAY SEEK The British government may revoke thelicences of selected Japanese banks and securities companiesoperating in London's financial City when they come up forrenewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening upJapan's markets to foreign competition, government sourcessaid.    "We can't say "yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)"but this is definitely being considered," an official said.    His comments came after the government was formally urgedtoday by a cross-section of influential MPs to take jointretaliatory action with the United States against Japan.    Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanesetrade practices. "There's a sense of urgency here now, but theemphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests inJapan," another government official told Reuters.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday thatBritain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in theFinancial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliateagainst countries that do not offer reciprocal market access.    She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said.    The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7billion stg, official figures show.    A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged theU.K. Government to "coordinate action with the President of theUnited States, and through the Department of Trade andIndustry, to suspend all further applications from Japanesecommunications companies for equipment approval by the BritishApprovals Board for Telecommunications, and all furtherapplications from Japanese financial institutions for licences"until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called"restrictive conditions" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC)(cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake inJapan's international telecommunications market.    The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-sectionof MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament.Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure onthe Conservative government to take firm action.    Officials said another option now being considered by theU.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japaneseinstitutions. That could be done under the government'sproposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.    58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to dealin London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-basedfirms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.    The new financial services and banking acts offer Britainan alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise deniedunder legally-binding international trade agreements.    "The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and IndustrySecretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging ininvestment, banking and insurance," one official said.    "This point has been made to the Japanese at official levela number times," the official added.    Britain and France are now working together to urge thatthe European Community take collective action against Japan,but by working within EC treaties, another official said.    British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radiointerview that the European Community should build barriersagainst Japanese imports through certification proceduressimilar to those facing European exporters in Japan.    "There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer," hesaid, adding "(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight."Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade"strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have afair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which isitself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of ourown domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness."    The situation is only likely to worsen following news thatJapan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by morethan 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrsfrom 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.    But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visibletrade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.    Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financialinstitutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, ratherthan larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a globalbusiness centre, government sources said. Japan's four largestsecurities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.    In Washington, White House officials said President Reaganwas ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan forbreaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.    There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act onthe recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curbJapanese exports to the United States but officials said themove could come today or early next week.    Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reaganincluded tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports whichuse semiconductors. REUTER

Woolworth Holdings says it bidding 244 mln stg for Superdru Indonesia has minimised the economicimpact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits andboosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said.    Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge incrude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half.    But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as tellingPresident Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct inthe financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct theprevious year.    Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said,although he did not give complete figures.    The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to generalelections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber,palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.    Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of theappreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark againstthe dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments.    He said the economy would have suffered more from the worldeconomic recession if the government had not devalued therupiah by 31 pct last September.    In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Postsaid the government must press ahead with measures toderegulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports.    The English-language daily said bigger export earnings wereneeded to finance not only imports but also the country'sgrowing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs.    "About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall duewithin the next three to five years and will steadily increasethe debt servicing burden," the paper said.    However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting inexpectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealerssaid.    Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar'snosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest raterebound to halt further dollar depreciation.

MANNESMANN BUYS INDIRECT MAJORITY STAKE IN SACHS Mannesmann AG <MMWG.F> said it hasreached a series of agreements giving it an indirect majoritystake in the <Fichtel und Sachs AG> car parts group.    The takeover is contingent on approval from the FederalCartel Office in West Berlin, a spokesman said, adding thatMannesmann was confident the authorities would not block thepurchase.    Mannesmann is buying 75 pct of <MEC SachsVermoegensholding> which owns 37.5 pct of Sachs AG, which inturn holds 96.5 pct of Fichtel und Sachs. The MEC shares willbe bought from the granddaughters of the firm's founder.    Mannesmann is also purchasing a 25.01 pct stake in Fichtelund Sachs from Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> and has an option to buythe bank's remaining 10 pct stake, a company statement said.    In addition to these firm agreements, Mannesmann is alsotalking with the state-owned steel group Salzgitter AG <SALG.H> on buying its 24.98 pct stake in Fichtel und Sachs. This would give Mannesmann around 75 pct of Fichtel und Sachs.    Salzgitter said it decided to give up its own originalplans to seek a majority stake in Sachs after holding talkswith the government in Bonn.    Earlier this month Mannesmann disclosed that it might wanta majority stake in Sachs after previously saying it wasseeking to buy only a minority holding in the company, whichhas annual turnover of 2.2 billion marks and employs 17,000.    The acquisition is part of Mannesmann's efforts todiversify into high-technology areas and away from its previousreliance on steel and pipe-making.

BASS GROUP SAYS IT HAS HAD TALKS ON SEEKING CONTROL OF TAFT BROA U.S. refiners will have toreduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, saidindustry officials attending the National Petroleum RefinersAssociation meeting here.     "If the refining sector can discipline itself to refineabout 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance topull down inventories to acceptable levels by the secondquarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president ofpetroluem products at Conoco Inc    "If not, the industry will have a tough 1987," he added.     Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said thatU.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity,with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the weekended March 20.     The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-agolevels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, theAPI said.     Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp<CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return toprofitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstreamoperations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.     "The jump in refining capacity is a concern if itcontinues," said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president ofrefining and marketing at <Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S.subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France.     Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity giventhe current level of demand but the operating level shouldincrease as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter,Buckler said.     Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S.refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crudeper day. "I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineriesover the next five years," he said, adding that thesefacilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crudeoil per day.

U.S. DOT APPROVES AMERICAN <AMR>-ACI <ACF> PACT The U.S. Department ofTransportation (DOT) said it gave final clearance to theproposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by AmericanAirlines Inc.    "The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessencompetition or to be inconsistent with the public interest," theDOT said in a statement.    AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is aunit of AMR Corp.    The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger planFeb. 20.    American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms ofrevenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively smallcarrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is thenation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would notalter American's third-place ranking, according to datacompiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine.    The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said.    The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantiallyreduce competition on the four routes on which both carriersprovide either nonstop or single-plane service.    At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOTsaid it found no evidence that other carriers could notincrease or begin service that competed with a mergedAmerican-AirCal.    Concerning the 14th, "While entry may not be possible at theOrange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that theservice provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, willprovide effective competition for Orange County travelers inlong-haul markets," the DOT said.    The merger would give American control of 37 pct of theauthorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange Countyterminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminalbuilding limit future opportunities for expansion.    The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed commentsopposing the merger but "raised no new facts or arguments."    Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American willpay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings. Reuter

GENCORP REJECTS UNSOLICITED TAKEOVER BID FROM AFG INDUSTRIES/WAGNER A U.S. District Court Judge RobertSweet granted requests by federal authorities for court ordersfreezing the assets of former Merrill Lynch executive NahumVaskevitch, who has been charged with insider trading.

GENCORP <GY> REJECTS UNSOLICITED TAKEOVER BID Gencorp Inc said its board urgedshareholders to reject the hostile unsolicited 100 dlr a sharetender offer made March 18 by General Acquisition Inc, anaffiliate of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries INc.    Gencorp also said it is developing a financially superioralternative that would enable shareholders to benefit from thefull value of the company.    In a letter to shareholders, Chairman A. William Reynolds said the offer is a "highly conditional, contingently financedbust-up offer" that seeks to deny shareholders the true valueof their investment in Gencorp.    Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject theoffer after careful study with legal and financial advisers. Hesaid the board has authorized management to explorealternatives aimed at providing shareholders with a"financially superior" alternative to the general acquisitionoffer.    A Gencorp spokesman, in response to questions, would notcomment on market speculation that the company's management maydevelop a leveraged buyout offer of its own. He would also notcomment on when a better alternative might be developed.    Gencorp's stock has traded well above the 100 dlr offerprice since the tender was made. Today, Gencorp closed at114-1/4, up 1-5/8.    Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years,Gencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholdervalue, and the stock price and earnings have improved since hejoined the company.    Gencorp said the partnership's offer is a "bargain price"acquisition that was "using financing from a syndicate of banksthat does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehmanbrothers that shearson is not obligated to provide."    Reynolds also said the offer would result in a radicalalteration and selloff of Gencorp's assets, including AerojetGeneral to refinance General Acquisition's borrowings with theprofits going to Wagner and Brown and AFG instead ofshareholders.    The letter also said the General Acquisition offer"jeopardizes the security and interests" of its shareholders,employees, customers, suppliers and the communities throughoutthe country where the company's facilities are located.

PARTNERS CALL GENCORP<GY> RESPONSE UNPRODUCTIVE General Acquisition Co said it wasdisappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer andquestioned how the company might give better value toshareholders.    Gencorp earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr pershare tender offer from the partnership, which includes Wagnerand Brown and AFG Industries Inc. The company said it wasstudying financially superior alternatives.   The partnership called the response inflammatory andunproductive, particularly since it had attempted to discussthe offer with Gencorp.     The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it wouldprovide a "superior value yet they continue their attempt toprevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poisonpill." Poison pills are shareholder rights plan that maketakeovers more expensive.    Gencorp said in its statement earlier that the date itsrights will trade separately from the common stock was extendedto April six from April three. It said the extension wassubject to further extensions by the board and is conditionedon no person aquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more ofGencorp prior to April six.    General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can becompleted in a timely manner using its financial arrangements.

CSR SELLING DELHI TO EXXON UNIT, DROPS DELHI FLOAT CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> and Exxon Corp <XON>unit <Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSRhas agreed to sell its <Delhi Australia Fund> (DAF) to Esso for985 mln Australian dlrs.    The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a jointstatement.    The previously announced float of part of its Delhiinterest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.    Delhi Australia Fund owns <Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, whichholds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd <STOS.S>-ledCooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.    In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equallyin any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensateprices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi'sinterests in the next two years, the statement said.    "The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest willbe more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with thefloat," CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.    Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focusefforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and buildingmaterials in which CSR has had long and successful managementexperience and strong market leadership.    With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businessesmore aggressively and earlier, he said.    As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhisale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of <PioneerSugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing itsentire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.    After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin isAustralia's largest oil and gas producing area with currentgross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gasliquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubicfeet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said.    The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The BrokenHill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait, its first onshoreproduction in Australia, they said.    Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assistin maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in theCooper-Eromanga area.    "These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency inoil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in BassStrait production now under way," McGill said.    In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelmansaid CSR was within days of completing plans for the float ofCSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso.    He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decisionin view of the risks associated with the oil business.    The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to shareequally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average morethan 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said.    Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi tonet realisable value as of today, CSR's annual balance-date,will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs.    However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assetswill significantly reduce this loss, he said.    He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by futureprospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in corebusinesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payablein July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 centsagainst 18 in 1985/86.

GAF CORP OFFERS 36 DLRS A SHARE CASH FOR BOR The Institute for Economic Research(WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 grossdomestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pctforecast made last December.    WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he sawthe one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, asthe upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revisiondue to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.    A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oilproducing states, combined with the effects of the dollar'sfall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.    Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth thisyear. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, privateconsumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pctin 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.    Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2pct last year due to the slack economic activity.    Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficitof about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billionsurplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria'scentral bank, last month forecast the current account would beroughly in balance this year.    However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should haveno notable effect on the government's attempts to cut thebudget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, hesaid. REUTER
FERRUZZI MAY FLOAT UP TO 49 PCT OF PARIS UNIT <Gruppo Ferruzzi> is studying aproject which could result in a public share offer of up to 49pct of its French unit <European Sugar (France)> and couldraise around 400 mln dlrs, Ferruzzi chairman Raul Gardini said.    Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration wasaimed at "international markets" and that the figure of 400 mlndlrs given in some press reports "was probably about right."    European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit EridaniaZuccherifici Nazionali SpA <ERDI.M>, is expected to absorb theEuropean corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc<CPC.N> which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy.    Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle tobuy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs.    A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group wasstudying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugaralong with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, butgave no details.    The flotation plan has been interpreted by financialanalysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of theCPC business.    In London yesterday, chairman of Belgian starch producer<Amylum NV> Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzziwas "apparently still organising finance," his company mightstill succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business.    Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said the 630mln dlrs agreed for the CPC acquisition would be paid "at thedate foreseen in the preliminary contract."    Gardini could not reveal the date in question nor give anyindication of the likely timing of an offering of shares inEuropean Sugar, but it was announced last week that Ferruzzi'spurchase of the CPC business was expected to be completed bySeptember 30.    Callebaut said yesterday that Amylum was surprised anddisappointed that its 675 mln dlr bid cash offer for CPC'sEuropean business was apparently rejected in favour ofFerruzzi's lower bid.    Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said "Amylumshould know that one succeeds in a bid by making the rightoffer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the caseof the acquisition of CPC's European business."    Gardini said it was not Callebaut's business to concernhimself with the European Sugar capital raising operation understudy, he added.    Asked about press reports that Ferruzzi might follow up theEuropean Sugar flotation with the sale of 49 pct of the CPCbusiness, Gardini said: "We do not exclude having minoritypartners in the CPC business."

Last week, GAF increased its ownership of Borg-Warnershares to 19.9 pct of those outstanding Minstar Inc <MNST> soldits 12.4 pct holding.

AKZO PLANNING US INVESTMENTS Dutch chemicals group AkzoNV <AKZO.AS> said it hoped to consolidate its core activitiesthis year by making small acquisitions in the US.   Akzo chairman Aarnoud Loudon told a news conference on its1986 report that the company wanted to achieve the same levelof US investments it had before it divested its fibre firmAmerican Enka in December 1985, when US investments represented20 pct of Akzo's total capital.   The US expansion plans were not an attempt to compensate forlosses in guilder income through the lower dollar, Loudon said.    He said a more important factor was the speed of growth inthe US, adding "It's the largest industrial market in the world."But he said the company would also be looking at possibleacquisitions in Europe.    Despite its highly liquid cash flow, Akzo did not planacquisitions on a scale that would negatively influence thecompany's debt/equity ratio, Loudon said.

William Reynolds, chairman andchief executive of GenCorp Inc, told shareholders he expects toannounce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostiletender within a week.

Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient, saying thegroup sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluateGenCorp while "we have had only 10 days to respond."    Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legalchallenges to its planned sale of WOR TV, serving the New YorkCity market, and expects to complete the sale by Friday.

Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges weredropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission hasalready approved the station's sale.    Money from the sale of the station will play a role inhelping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsoredby AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and Brown, Reynoldssaid. He provided no other details.

Greenmail describes a buyout of a minorityshareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynoldssaid he considers it a "repugnant device."    Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors.Mario Gabelli, head of a New York investment firm which owns alarge block of stock, proposed one nominee for the board.Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to "stiffenthe backbone of the board to discourage greenmail."

TALKING POINT/BORG-WARNER CORP <BOR> Borg-Warner Corp will vigorouslyresist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but theMidwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer,either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe.    Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAFthrough a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner'sstock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading.    Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman willstage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he canadd its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF.    "It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question isnow do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they wantto remain independent," said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps.    Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculationfor almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle,Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mlnBorg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding.    Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took nosteps toward a transaction.    "Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them forthe last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporatebattles I've seen," said one analyst.    The battle, however, has heated up, and the range ofbreakup values on Wall Street span from the current marketprice to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said theythink a price in the low 50s would be appropriate.    Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily onits 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner.    Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end upwith Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materialscompany in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted anunsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefitedfrom that company's restructuring.    "Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimateoffer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind ofbetween a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. Ipersonally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs pershare," said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson.    Henderson also speculated the company might attempt arestructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire andRubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir JamesGoldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock andcarried out a wider share repurchase.    Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman isseeking "greenmail," or the repurchase of his stock by thecompany at a premium.    Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems withfinancing the transaction.    Previously associated with "junk bond" experts, DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warnertakeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tenderoffer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArnerboard and conditioned on the board's recommendation of thetender offer and merger.    Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects amerger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employeessince the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repaydebt from the transaction.    GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8.   "I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at thelevel it is proposing it would enhance GAF share valuessubstantially," said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose.    He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for thecompany's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF'scurrent holdings.    Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings.    The plastics are used in telephone equipment, officeequipment and appliances. "Borg has half the market in the U.S.and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,"Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co <DOW> andMonsanto Corp <MTC>, he said.    Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and aprotective systems business, which includes Wells Fargosecurity guards. It also has an information services business,and is trying to sell its financial services business.    Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share onrevenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986,earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs pershare on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs.    GAF's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mlnfrom its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer, aspecial union carbide dividend, and the sale of its UnionCarbide shares. Reuter

The company said conditions of the offer include thereceipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's sharesoutstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of itsshare purchase rights plan.

"We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fitwith each other and that the combination will enable each of usto better serve our existing customers and meet the challengesof the future," Emery's chairman said in his letter.    He said a merger would significantly enhance the financialturnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast.    Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached forcomment on the offer, which was released several hours afterthe stock market had closed.    Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.

U.S. SUPREME COURT ALLOWS DELTA-WESTERN MERGER U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra DayO'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunctionblocking the planned merger of Delta <DAL> AirlinesInc and Western Airlines <WAL>, the Court said.    O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel ofthe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco hadblocked the merger until a dispute over union representationhad been settled by arbitration.    A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay ofthe injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs,to go through as planned later today.    The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Eachof the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over aparticular regional Appellate circuit and has the power toprovisionally overturn its rulings without comment.    The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials ofAtlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the mergerfor months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanesbelonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.    "Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,"Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution latelast night. "There was really very little that remained to bedone."    The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had beenfiled in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air TransportEmployees union sought to force Western's management to fulfilla promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger tookplace.    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not beenforced in a takeover by a larger company.    After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officialslast night spread the word by telephone that Western employeesshould report for work today in their old uniforms, not in newDelta outfits.    Delta announced last September that it was purchasingWestern. The merger took place in December, and Western hasbeen operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Westernname was to have disappeared at midnight last night.    At issue is whether the Western unions would continue torepresent Western employees after the integration of the twoairlines.    While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees areunionized, only Delta's pilots are union members.    Delta had maintained that the three unions having contractswith Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and theTeamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be"extinguished" after today.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial andlegal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IVoffer, which it said it considers inadequate.    The alternatives being explored include a restructuring,leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by anothercompany, Conrac said.    Conrac, which said its board discussed the alternatives atspecial meetings on March 26 and 30, said that its decision onwhether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on "thefuture actions of Mark IV" and its unsolicitied tender offer.

At a board meeting yesterday, Concac's directors deleted aprovision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of allclasses of its voting stock to call a special shareholdersmeeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders toremove directors without cause, the company said.

TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER <PCC> Emery Air Freight Corp topped aleveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offermay surface.    Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 overEmery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per shareor 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc.    Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer forPurolator exceeded their expectations.    Several analysts previously had said they saw takeovervalues for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per sharerange. At least one, however, estimated the company could betaken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share.    Analysts today would not venture to say whether anotheroffer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to thebelief that the bidding could go higher.    "They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer.Emery has shown the courage to go forth," said one arbitrager,who speculated other courier companies may also emerge asbidders.    "It makes sense," said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey.But "It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a100 pct of the synergies."    Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings inthe short term, but long term, after eliminating redundanciesand selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery'sprofitability.    Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rivalUnited Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. packagedelivery company after Federal Express Corp <FDX>, which has 47pct of the market.    Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator wouldhave about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr deliverybusiness.    "This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight(delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,"said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co.    Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, andits chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call.    E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer,but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period onits offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST.    One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likelyHutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical acompany outside the package delivery industry would want tooutbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company.    Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by someof its management and the E.F. Hutton Group <EFH> subsidiary,speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come.    The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolatorboard member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said hebelieved a better offer could be made by another entity.    A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director hadno contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers linedup for Purolator.    Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into questionby a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attemptedto stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth.Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday.    Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer couldbe bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning tokeep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279mln dlr "bridge" loan that would later be replaced with otherdebt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator.    Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk nits investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its279 mln dlr loan.    Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mlndlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs inrevenues. Reuter

A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not beencontacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with theSecurities and Exchange Commission about a stake in thecompany.    "There is some hope among investors that there will someprogress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patentinfringement suit with Kodak," analyst Michael Ellmann ofWertheim and Co said.    Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could beset or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement.    The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges thatKodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. InOctober 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras orfilm that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesmansaid.    Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that anyprogress will be made in tomorrow's hearing.    Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost todayfrom some optimism concerning new products the company iscurrently working on.

Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding fromDeutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal withCreditanstalt.

Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal HighCourt, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in thebalance sheet section "participations," Christians said.

COMPROMISE CITED ON SAN MIGUEL SHARES <San Miguel Corp>, SMC, and <UnitedCoconut Planters Bank>, UCPB, have reached a compromise on adisputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of agovernment panel that controls the sequestered shares said.    Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on GoodGovernment (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB.    "It looks good," Diaz said. But he added several issues,including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares,had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to thesale.    The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares abortedSMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in theUCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares wereactually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate offormer President Ferdinand Marcos.    Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB whenhe fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration.    "The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB areowned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers," Diaz said. "Naturally we donot want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies."    PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a downpayment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiaryNeptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.    The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would beforfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed tofulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originallynegotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.    PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food andbeverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln "B" class sharesfrom the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at aprice of 150 pesos per share.    The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion pesotransaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferredshares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollecteddividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced toUCPB-controlled trading companies.    The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per sharemade by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15pct stock dividend declared in June last year.    A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board mettoday to discuss the proposed compromise.    The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the boardmeeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.    President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB toset up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownershipissue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.    Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMCboard, filed a formal complaint before the Securities andExchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight otherdirectors of violating "fiduciary duty."    De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC'sboard last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan. REUTER

DUFF/PHELPS PUTS STANDARD OIL<SRD> ON WATCH LIST Duff and Phelps put the outstandingfixed income securities of of Standard Oil Co on its watch listfollowing the tentative offer by British Petroleum of NorthAmerica <BP> to buy the company.    Standard Oil's nearly three billion dlrs of long-term debtis currently rated DP-5 (high A) by the ratings agency.    British Petroleum currently owns about 55 pct of StandardOil's outstanding common stock and to acquire the remainder atthe tender offer price of 70 dlrs per share would cost 7.4billion dlrs.    British Petroleum intends to fund two-thirds of thatpurchase with borrowed funds and the rest with cash.    The additional debt will raise the fixed obligation ratioof British Petroleum from under 30 pct to perhaps 45 pct andincrease its debt service requirements, Duff and Phelps said.    However, putting Standard Oil's debt on its watch list,which Duff and Phelps said had "potentially negativeimplications," may eventually result in an upgrade depending onhow British Petroleum restructures the company, Howard Mount ofthe ratings agency said.    Mount said that acquiring Standard Oil's substantial cashflows and eliminating the annual dividend, which totaled 305mln dlrs to common shareholders in 1986, would help satisfyBritish Petroleum's higher debt service.

TALKING POINT/SANTA FE SOUTHERN <SFX> Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp may havemore difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off apossible takeover by Henley Group <HENG>, which has accumulatedalmost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroadconglomerate, analysts said.    Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henleydisclosed its stake in the company earlier this week, butanalysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover isits intention.    Analysts also said the company has strong defenses thatwould easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problemscombining its two railroad properties, which hang in regulatorylimbo.    Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that SantaFe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cashequivalents, while its long-term debt to capital was just over25 pct. "This gives them plenty of borrowing power," he said,which could be used against an unwanted suitor.    Henley Group's Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wantsto take major positions in undervalued natural resourcecompanies. He also told Reuters in an interview he is seekingan acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs.    Santa Fe officials don't appear concerned that Henley mightlaunch a takeover. "I would not characterize the atmospherearound here as one of concern," one Santa Fe executive saidabout Henley.    "I think it's wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firmstrategy with Santa Fe," said Mark Hassenberg, who coversHenley for DLJ Securities.    Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe's land assets arelikely to be realized slowly. They add that Santa Fe's effortsto merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo,sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeablefuture.    These realities, they said, support the Henley Group'sstatement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment.    The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcomingdifficulties in merging its two railroads, the Atchison, Topekaand Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co.The merger would create the nation's second-longest railroad.    Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) deniedthe merger on anticompetitive grounds.    The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights tofour western railroads to meet the ICC's concerns and persuadeit to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle tomerge the lines.    "My guess is the commission will decide in three to sixweeks whether to reopen hearings," Fischer said.    "I believe they've made an effort to satisfy the ICC'sobjections," he said. "But in doing so they haven't pleasedeveryone. Before they had Burlington Northern on their side,now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are setup."    If the hearings are reopened, analysts predicted it willtake six to nine months for everyone to have their say, and upto another year for the ICC to decide.    Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buybackprogram begun in 1984. It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as ofFebruary 1, when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding, aspokesman said.    Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned byNorfolk Southern, one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 andanother of 1.7 mln shares in 1985, one analyst said.    James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fightoff the Henley Group with its cash and credit. Citing the sharebuybacks from Norfolk Southern, he said one of Santa Fe'soptions, if threatened, could be to buy the Henley stake.    "It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as alow-risk, opportunistic investment," Voytko said.    "People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrsto 50 dlrs a share," said DLJ Securities' Hassenberg. "But I'mcertain that in Dingman's mind, the company is worth more thanthat in breakup value." Reuter

SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES The Securities and ExchangeCommission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering forthe shares of companies that they must extend the period theiroffers are open if key conditions are changed.    Specifically, the agency said those making tender offersfor companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide toeliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to betendered in order for the offers to be valid.    Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions.As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the sharesthat were tendered if the minimum level were not reached.    In an interpretation of current rules, which officials saidclarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tenderoffer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived,even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.    The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum sharecondition is a "material change" of the tender offer under U.S.securities law, SEC officials said.    The SEC has already said that other specific materialchanges, such as changes in the percentage of securities beingsought or the price being offered, made during the course of atender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.    The length of the extension, which is aimed at givingshareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tenderoffer, was not specified in cases where the minimum shareconditions were waived.    SEC officials said the length of the extension in suchcases would depend on the facts and circumstances surroundingeach case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.    The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waiversof a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of eachoffer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the newinformation. Officials declined to identify the two offers.    "If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end ofits offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequatedissemination," the SEC said.    Federal securities law requires that all tender offersremain open for at least 20 business days. Reuter

SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER Sumitomo Bank Ltd <SUMI.T> is certain tolose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result ofits merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.    Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bankwith an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, inOctober.    But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsutold Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain itsposition.    "We'll be back in position in first place within threeyears," Komatsu said in an interview.    He said that while the merger will initially reduceSumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expandSumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area whereit has been relatively weak.    But financial analysts are divided on whether and howquickly the gamble will pay off.    Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo inview of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the mergerwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branchnetwork from scratch.    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It hasexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities businessand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned thewisdom of some of those moves.    "They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Nowit's largely out of their hands," said Kleinwort Benson Ltdfinancial analyst Simon Smithson.    Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move toenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in Americaninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being atleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchangepersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.    "The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because theFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected," said one analyst.    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.    "U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,we can do various things. We only have to wait two or threeyears, not until the 21st century," Komatsu said.    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routesinto the securities business at home.    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan'sversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercialfrom investment banking.    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsusaid he hopes further deregulation will create newopportunities.    "We need to find new business chances," Komatsu said. "In somecases these will be securities related, in some cases trustbank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want."    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on suchdomestic securities business as profitable government bonddealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities CoLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about enteringthe securities business here through its Swiss universal banksubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences tosecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,following a similar decision for subsidiaries of Europeanuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similardecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.    "We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowedin two or three years," he said.    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expandlending to individuals and small and medium businesses toreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot oftime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including themerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.    "It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies," saidKleinwort's Smithson.    "After that, it's a question of absorbing and jugglingaround. It will be the next decade before we see if thestrategy is right or wrong." REUTER

SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) <SANM.MN>to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United CoconutPlanters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sourcesin the Philippine food and brewery company said.    A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPBfrom selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC'soutstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings onApril 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a formerchairman of both SMC and UCPB.    Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.    Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB andrepresented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB'splans to sell the shares to SMC were "a serious breach offiduciary duties."    The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also beheld up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, agovernment nominee on the company's board.    De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week bythe company's board.    On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of thesequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos pershare. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retainedearnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by thepurchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration ofdividends.    De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violatean SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debtto equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramondel Rosario as telling the board that the transaction wouldboost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.    In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earliersuit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman AndresSoriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.    De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuminglast December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kongsubsidiary <Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's boardmeeting.    An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino toresolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report byApril 15.    "The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part ofa continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregardof the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an earlydisposition of the sequestered shares," San Miguel Corp said ina statement.    "Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB havereached agreement on the price of the shares and the method ofpayment, this suit is in direct contravention of thegovernment's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlementof the controversy by April 15," the statement added.    A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment onCojuangco's court petition, adding: "Any statement coming fromus might be interpreted as adversarial."    Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel whichsequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligibleto buy the major portion of the shares because he was a UnitedStates citizen.    The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln "A" shares,which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln "B" shares whichare available to foreign buyers.    SMC sources said Soriano personally was not amongprospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased bythe <A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamedinstitutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyersin a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.    The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission onGood Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they wereowned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former PresidentFerdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in theU.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividendannounced last June.    "We have no objection to Soriano buying the "B" shares," Diaztold Reuters. "But everything is on hold now."    The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversywould be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'meeting, scheduled for May 14.    San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billionpesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985. REUTER

CONRAC CORP SAID IT HAS ENTERED TALKS ON ITS ACQUISITION WITH SEVERAL Britain and Japan clashed today over U.K.Demands for greater access to the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) astrade tensions between the two countries mounted.    British consumer affairs minister Michael Howard toldreporters he was dissatisfied with the exchange's response toBritain's non-negotiable timetable for increased Britishmembership and warned of possible reprisals in the future.    He described his meeting with Tokyo stock exchange (TSE)head Michio Takeuchi, in which he demanded greater exchangeaccess, as "very frank indeed."    In a separate press conference, TSE President MichioTakeuchi said the exchange has done its utmost to liberaliseits membership and called on Britain to make some concessions.    According to Takeuchi, Howard wants three British firms tobe named members of the Tokyo stock exchange by the end of thisyear. Neither Takeuchi nor Howard would name the companies.    "Next May is the earliest possible date for opening ourmembership and I want the British government to understandthis," Takeuchi said.    Membership cannot be increased before space on the tradingfloor is expanded in May 1988, he said.     Howard told reporters that was not good enough and saidthat Britain would use its powers to ban Japanese financialinstitutions from London if it was not satisfied with Tokyo.    Japan has until the next meeting of senior officials fromthe two countries in May or June to come up with a postiveresponse to the British timetable or face retaliation, he said.    "The timetable was constructed in a way that made it a veryreasonable request and I expect it to be met," he said.    Asked about the exchange's argument that it has no floorspace to expand membership, Howard replied, "We find it verydifficult in our country to understand why the considerableingenuity and resourcefulness of the Japanese (in worldmarkets) is unable to overcome problems of that kind."    While here, Howard said he also expressed frustration withthe huge trade imbalance with Japan and with Tokyo's handlingof demands by Britain's Cable and Wireless for a greater rolein Japan's telecommunications business.    According to Japanese newspaper reports, at least some ofthat message may have penetrated.    According to several reports, the Post andTelecommunications Ministry is considering a Cable and Wirelessproposal for a telephone cable between Japan and the U.S.    Ministry officials were unavailable for comment.

PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION Senate Banking Committee ChairmanWilliam Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introducelegislation shortly to require greater public disclosure ofcorporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.    Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increasedthe chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.    "We are proposing legislation that would provide for moredisclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and wouldinsure that takeovers are properly financed," he said.    Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the thresholdfor notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that ainvestor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in acompany to three pct from the current five pct threshold within10 days, Proxmire said.    In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirementthat an investor intended to aquire three pct that would haveto filed with the SEC.    Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant toprevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public inknowing about coming takeover attempts.    Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that atender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60business days from the current 20 business days.    His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiringcompany violated the time period on the tender offer.    To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmiresaid the legislation would aim at insuring current marginrequirments are properly enforced.    The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirementfor purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generallyenforced in hostile takeovers.    Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeoverdeclare that they can raise the capital for a takeover withoutactually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.    He said his bill would allow private suits for damages forfailure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct marginrequirements.    The bill also would require more disclose when severalinvestors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.    "When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to knowabout it," Proxmire said.    Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britaintowards two-tiered tender offers that insures that allshareholders recieve equal treatment.    He said he expected amendments to the bill also would coverdefensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.    Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later thismonth and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.    He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill thisyear. Reuter

TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES <BUR> The largest U.S. textile maker focusedon its own business as its competitors found merger partners,but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itselfinto an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.    The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman andDominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pctstake.    A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointlyacquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeoveroffer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman forMontreal-based Dominion called the report just "rumors."    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced ofthe story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors ifBurlington actually came into play.    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that itwas looking for a takeover in the U.S.    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Millsand has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used fora U.S. acquisition.    A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producerhas been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies, butwould not say whether Burlington was among them.    "There have been acquisitions in this area. It's notunusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after thehousecleaning they've done," said Eileen Gormley of ThomsonMcKinnon.    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheetsand other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrslast year. It also has reorganized management, and focused itsoperations on businesses that would be less affected by foreigncompetition, Gormley said.    "They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,"said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrialfabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpetsand other fabric to the auto industry.    "In the past, they just spent and never realized the returnon the outlays they did make," she said.    "You look at their record over the year, and I thinkthey're poised to be more profitable than they had been in thepast," Gormley said.     She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, upfrom 2.01 dlrs per share.    Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlingtonat its current levels.    Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommendsselling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earningsbasis.    Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have beenplaced on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.    "After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of peopledon't find him very credible anymore," said one arbitrager.    Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcingmanagements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even ifhe doesn't win the target company.    Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for LuckyStores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buyingPonderosa Inc.    The stocks of other textile makers rose along withBurlington.    J.P. Stevens <STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and FieldcrestCannon Inc <FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest andCannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc <WPM>rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8. Reuter

UAL <UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY UAL Inc may have a response thisafternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its UnitedAirlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.    "Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and weneed to get a clarification out," the spokesman said, addingthat there was a "50-50" chance a statement would be releasedtoday.    The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.    Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for severalweeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developerDonald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he alsoheld discussions with its chairman.    The developer indicated in those talks that he took theposition as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buyingUAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2mln shares.    "United has got to consider this proposal. I think thepilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,but it could put some interesting options in front of UALmanagement," said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attackwhen it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertzrental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in astrategy to become a travel service company.    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots unionconcerned that the company was not focussing enough attentionon its airline.    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing itsnew focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street hasbeen busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL aswidespread, indicative to them that big institutions believethe stock is in play.    Market sources have said that although Trump attractedattention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as acatalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhapsthrowing the company into the hands of another buyer.    "The first domino is you have an investor with aconsiderable stake. the second domino is the union. That typeof attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,"said Pettee.    "What's interesting is the values are there. There'ssomething for everybody," he said. Reuter

The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault onMarch nine set April nine as the target date for completingnegotiations.    However, the letter also allowed room for an extension ofthat date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.    The two companies said they "now plan to complete work byApril 23."    Chrysler and Renault said, "Given the complex nature of thedeal, the need for additional time was to be expected."    The March letter of intent between the two companies saysthat Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date"in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discoversan unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'investigation of the company," referring to American Motors.    A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problemhad cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company'sstatement that more time was needed because the talks arecomplex. "That is our definition of the delay," she said.    Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine orwhen an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendendby a written agreement by both companies.    The Chrysler spokeswoman said, "We are still working towarda definitive agreement."

MORE AMERICAN BRANDS <AMB> ACQUISITIONS SEEN American Brands Inc's 545 mln dlrsacquisition of National Distillers and Chemical Corp's liquorbusiness is expected to be one of a series of acquisitions bythe tobacco company, analysts said.     "They were very frustrated with their inability to getChesebrough. They said they were looking for an acquisition.

American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billiondlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed tobuy the company. But since then, Wall Street has beenspeculating that American Brands would find another candidateto help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.

American Brands had to make an acquisition becausetobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their positionis a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,"he said.cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco businessdoes require great amounts of capital expenditures. It cantherefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said theNational Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's ginand vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite thetype of acquisition they envisioned.

CLEVITE INDUSTRIES SAYS J.P. INDUSTRIES OFFER India's private businessmen say theyhave been placed on an unequal footing in raising money fromthe capital market because government companies are wooinginvestors by issuing more attractive tax-free bonds.    Stock brokers and bankers polled by Reuters said althoughequity shares or debenture issues floated by private firmsprovide a higher return and shorter maturity, they are fastlosing their popular appeal as they are liable to both wealthand income taxes.    Brokers said many investors are transferring funds intogovernment company bonds because of their tax-free status andeasy transferability.    About 100 private companies have postponed plans to issueequity shares and debentures in the first quarter of fiscal1987/88 partly on account of fierce competition from publicsector bonds, a merchant banker said.    They included equity shares and rights issue worth onebillion rupees planned to be issued this month by TataFertilisers Ltd, he said, adding the issue has been postponedindefinitely.    "The government bonds are making serious inroads on theprivate sector companies' resources," said R. P. Goenka,president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce andIndustry.    "The discriminatory tax treatment should be done away withand equal facilities be provided to the two sectors to mobiliseresources from the market which is common to both," Goenka said.    A senior Finance Ministry official said government andprivate firms were free to compete to raise resources, addingit was not correct that public sector-issued bonds werepreventing private firms from raising money on the stockmarket.    "Debentures and equity shares floated by private companiesstill account for at least 60 pct of total capital raised instock exchanges," the ministry official said.    A spokesman at Bombay stock brokers Batliwala and Karanisaid government bonds were valued at about 20 billion rupees orabout 40 pct of 50 billion rupees raised by both government andnon-government firms in the domestic capital market in 1986/87.    The share was 35 to 40 pct of about 36.95 billion rupeesmobilised in 1985/86, he said. "To save taxes, commercial banks,mainly foreign banks, and some private companies, are investingtheir surplus funds in the tax free bonds," he said.    "Individuals who are very well off are also investing in thebonds to gain tax benefits while only small investors are goingfor equities or debentures floated by private companies on aselective basis," the spokesman said.    The maturity period of government company bonds variesbetween seven and 10 years. No wealth or income taxes arepayable on nine pct seven-year bonds but those carrying 13 pctinterest on 10-year bonds are subjected to income tax if interest amount^Mexceeds 7,000 rupees a year.    Equity shares, the 14 pct non-convertible debentures and12.5 to 14 pct convertible debentures issued by privatecompanies are not exempted from either the wealth tax or fromthe tax on income earned from them.    The government bonds are listed as securities but traded onIndia's four major stock exchanges. They can be sold freely onthe stock market by simple endorsement while debentures canonly be sold to the company after one year, brokers said.    Government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom inthe stock market since 1984/85 sparked by liberal taxconcessions and reforms in exchange operations, brokers said.    The National Thermal Power Corp, NTPC, was the firstgovernment company to issue the bonds to raise one billionrupees in January last year, breaking the monopoly of privatecompanies on the capital market. The seven-year NTPC bond wasoversubscribed three times, brokers said.    Official figures show bonds floated by government companieshave been heavily oversubscribed. More state companies havesought the Ministry's permission to issue them in comingmonths.    NTPC's second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 4.51billion rupees against 1.2 billion originally permitted by theFinance Ministry.    The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam mobilised 3.83 billion rupeeslast year against authorised 1.5 billion and last month theIndian Railway Finance Corporation's record susbcriptiontotalled 5.5 billion rupees against authorised 2.5 billion.    In most cases, the government has allowed the companies tomaintain the oversubscribed amount, brokers said.    Goenka said that government bonds are making itincreasingly difficult for private companies to launch newequity or debenture issues. He said the government could atleast "fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised throughsuch bonds by the public sector."    Merchant bankers said the government is pressing statecompanies to borrow from the public by reducing financialsupport to them.    To ease its internal debt burden, the government hasreduced the budgetary support to development investment inabout 120 public sector companies to 69.92 billion rupees in1987/88 from 77.92 billion a year earlier, official figuresshow.

OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS A 3.22 billion dlr offer for DomePetroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO>may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the doorfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said.    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire.    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations.    TransCanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring," oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto.    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.    "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary.    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said.    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added.    "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome)," Gobert said.    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward," he said.    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said.    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's.    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.

Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans tosell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargosecurity guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.    Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation forabout a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposeda takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of thestock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakupvalues for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range andspeculated an offer would have to be sweetened.    In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed theMerrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender theirshares. The board received opinions on the offer from itsadvisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.

The debentures will be redeemable at the company's optionfor the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.

TAKEOVER BATTLE FOR DOME PETROLEUM BEGINS A takeover battle began today fordebt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> as TransCanadaPipeLines Ltd <TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer andDome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.    Companies mentioned in market speculation as potentialbuyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A> which is 70pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON.N>, <PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd<CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L>.    Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had anotherproposal from "a substantial company" and discussions with athird company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in astatement.    The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,but did not identify the companies involved in talks.    TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipelineoperator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, commonand preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary whichwould own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offeris to Dome management, not to shareholders.    Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.    Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement "violatedthe terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement enteredinto with prospective purchasers" and was apparently timed toprevent Dome from considering other proposals.    It said the TransCanada bid "seems to require favourable andsubstantial taxation concessions from the federal andprovincial governments." But Dome added that its management andfinancial advisers will evaluate all proposals.    TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said hewas surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and deniedthat TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. "I find (Dome'sstatement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision toauthorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announceit," he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of theother bidders, or the terms of other offers.    Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on theToronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981. REUTER

SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD <CAW> Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he hasraised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs eachfrom 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seekingto 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.    In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by hisMTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the prorationperiod will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer hadbeen scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said hehad received a "negligible" number of shares in response to theoffer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.    Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mlncommon shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on aprimary basis.    Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization planas an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholderswould receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subjectto approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held inJune.    The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mlndlrs in debt to finance the payout.    Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that theamended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares togive him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and onthe arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by NewJersey and Nevada gaming authorities.    He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring allof Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by amerger transaction.    Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shareshe is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.    He said he still has received only a "negligible" number ofshares in response to his tender.    In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included inthe statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing toincrease the price of his offer.    Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully inplace.    Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ> has now deliveredto him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasingdividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS HoldingCorp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.    He said Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, which leads asyndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlrmargin facility, believes it will be able to arrange forfurther commitments under the margin facility to advance up toan additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit thepurchase of shares under the offer.    Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted intoSeries A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby anindependent investment baking firm.    He said "To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdharesare purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive acombination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a valueof 32 dlrs per share of Caesars."    Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior toCaesars' recapitalization.    Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gamingofficials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatoryprocess required for regulatory approval, a process that italready underway in New Jersey.    He said his offer has been extended based on the likelyduration of the regulatory process.

GAF <GAF> SEEN RAISING BORG-WARNER <BOR> BID GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-WarnerCorp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts tobe preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.     Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill LynchCapital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash andsecurities for the balance.    Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.    "I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming inwith another bid," said one analyst, who values the company at51 or 52 dlrs per share.    GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct ofBorg-Warner's stock.    "You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to upthe price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you haveto. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're lookingat it - that it's worth more," Pershing and Co analyst RichardHenderson said.    Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.    GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. MerrillLynch officials did not return phone calls.    Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heymansought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plasticsbusiness. The rigid plastics are used in such things astelephones, computer terminals, and appliances.    "Where the heck can you buy a world class chemicaloperation these days," said Henderson.    "He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and hedoes not like to get pushed around," said Henderson.    GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeoverof the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAFdid not win the company, it made a substantial gain on itsinvestment in Carbide.    Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into itsBorg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offerand does not succeed, a higher bid from another company wouldgive GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.    "It's a win-win situation," said one analyst.    One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would beforthcoming shortly.    "I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in thisbook," he said.    Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,protective services, which includes Wells Fargo securityguards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.    Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who followsGAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, itwould realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 pershare.    "I think there's a probability he goes up in price," saidRose.    Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heymanwould do. "Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."    "Is he trying to build a major industrial chemicalenterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank," Rosesaid.    Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would addearnings momentum to GAF. "I worked out that paying as much as50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, ifthey sold off most of the non-chemical facilities," said JohnHenry of E.F. Hutton.    Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billiondlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and netearnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.

DOME <DMP> BENEFITS FROM TAKEOVER SPECULATION Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd postedtheir biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stockmarkets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for thedebt-heavy company.    Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange andgained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto StockExchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as highas 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Domehas normally moved by only a few cents per day.    TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlrCanadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, butDome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also stilltalking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.    Market analysts today said the other two firms are believedto be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterdaystressed that its bid is "a Canadian solution to the financialdifficulties of Dome Petroleum."    "The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont<DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC>, which sold its Canadianinterest in 1975 and could be getting back in," said Wilf Gobertof Peters and Co Ltd.    David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that BritishPetroleum PLC <BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despiteBP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percentof Standard Oil Co <SRD> it does not already own.    Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has saidin recent reports that Amoco Corp <AN> has also been in talkswith Dome.    Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as "awfullyoptimistic," given TransCanada's offer to give current Domeshareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10dlrs Canadian per common share.    Under the offer, current Dome common and preferredshareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, whichwould own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanadawould own 80 pct.    However, Bryson said the market may be looking at thepotential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. "TheTransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,"he said.    Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is "at theupper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome."    The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with anotherone billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available tosecured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above acertain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.    Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billionCanadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took onseveral years ago when oil prices were high and the companywanted to expand.    "There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capableof supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on thatbasis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,"Gobert said.    Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that itis a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holdsreserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billioncubic feet of natural gas.    The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acresof oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, theheart of Canada's oil industry.   Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres ofland across Canada.   The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrsCanadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be thelargest ever by a Canadian company.    Reuter

MERRILL TO GET 30 MLN DLR FEE IN BORG <BOR> DEAL Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER>subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said itcould realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or notthe deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealermanager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.    But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mlndlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another partyholding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.    The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in anytender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealermanager services or for break-up of the deal.    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group ofinvestors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tenderoffer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.    The company's board has approved the plan, which wasintended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.    Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series Apreferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr ashare exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.    Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possibleleveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.    At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it wouldconsider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it saidit was told the company had decided against a buyout.    But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr ashare proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.    Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warnermanagement was asked not to take part in the new deal and itwas conditioned upon payment of the fees.    In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will alsoget up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses inthe tender offer.    Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warneras a subsidiary with its current officers keeping theirpositions.    But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it isconsidering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number ofsubsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.    All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.    Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debtof Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.    To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects toborrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mlndlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs ofnon-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynchand Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes toMerrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs ofsubordinated discount debentures.

AMOCO <AN> MAY BUY DOME <DMP>, REPORT SAYS Amoco Corp is apparently the successfulbidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to apublished report.    The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to thenegotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night withTransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.    No financial details about the Amoco offer were availableand a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amocohad emerged the winner, the newspaper said.    However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Domecould be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe andMail said.    Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available forcomment.    Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Domesaid it was also in talks with two other companies, but refusedto identify them.    Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco andExxon Corp's <XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary inCanada.    British Petroleum PLC <BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD>have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.    In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured bythe federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,the only Canadian company in the bidding.    Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to wantto avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the governmentgave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks toencourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts andofficials have said.    A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to runafoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada isasking for tax concessions from a federal government that istrying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,analysts have said.    A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreignoil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.    Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-basedAmoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs.

After CTS invoked the state law, Dynamics filed a lawsuitchallenging the constitutionality of the measure.    One effect of the law is to impose a 50-day delay on thetender offer at the option of the target company.    It also requires that the acquisition for control shares inan Indiana corporation does not include voting rights unless amajority of all pre-existing shareholders so agree at theirnext regularly scheduled meeting.    Justice Lewis Powell, writing for the court majority, heldthat the state law was not pre-empted by federal securitieslaw.       "The Indiana Act protects independent shareholders from thecoercive aspects of tender offers by allowing them to vote as agroup," he said.    He acknowledged that the law may delay some tender offersand may decrease the number of successful tender offers forIndiana corporations.    But he said the law does not discriminate againstinterstate commerce and was justified by the state's interestsin protecting shareholders.    Reuter
TRANSCANADA <TRP> DENIES REPORTS OF NEW BID TransCanada PipeLines Ltd deniedreports that it raised its offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP>to 5.5 billion Canadian dlrs from 4.3 billion.    A report on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) late lastnight said TransCanada's new bid was rejected by Dome, whichhas accepted a 5.1 billion dlr bid from Amoco Corp <AN>.

Dome was halted today on the Toronto Stock Exchange pendingclarification of TransCanada's offer. It last traded at 1.70dlrs per share.

SORO GROUP TO LIMIT FAIRCHILD <FEN> STOCK BUYS Quantum Fund N.V., a NetherlandsAntilles mutual fund for which New York investor George Sorosis investment adviser, said it has agreed to limit furtherpurchases of Fairchild Industries Inc stock.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Quantum, which already holds 1,647,481 Fairchild common shares,or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding, said it agreed to therestriction after Fairchild said its security clearance mightbe jeopardized if Quantum acquires a major stake in it.    But Quantum said Fairchild management was told that Soros,acting either individually or through entities other thanQuantum that he controls, may decide to buy common stock in thecompany on his own behalf.    Quantum had recently notified the Federal Trade Commissionunder the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976that it might buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild's voting stock.Unless the FTC had objected, Quantum would have been free, butnot obligated, to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild stock.    Fairchild management, however, warned that if Quantum, aforeign entity, raises its stake in the company to 49.9 pct, itcould "impair" the government security clearances Fairchildneeds to carry out its its defense contract work.    In response, Quantum said it told Fairchild it will notmake "significant additional purchases" of its common orpreferred stock without giving Fairchild enough prior notice toenable it to consult with Quantum over the impact of action.    Quantum also said it has withdrawn its notification requestto the FTC and the antitrust division of the Justice Departmentof its intent to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild.    Quantum also said it told the FTC and the JusticeDepartment that it does not expect to resubmit any furthernotifications of intent to significantly raise its stake inFairchild at this time.    The restrictions Quantum has agreed to follow regardingfurther dealings in Fairchild stock do not apply to Soros as anindividual investor.

Redland has indicated that it would be prepared to considerat a later stage an increase in CSR's Monier stake to enable itto become a CSR subsidiary, assuming Redland exercises thesecond option, CSR said.    It said the offer is generous because it will give Moniershareholders a price equivalent to 16.8 times after-taxearnings in 1985/86 ended June 30, a 25 pct premium overFriday's market price and a 125 pct premium over last reportednet tangible asset backing per share of 1.57 dlrs.

MAXWELL FILES SUIT TO STOP HARCOURT <HBJ> Publisher Robert Maxwell's BritishPrinting and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit inU.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, itsdirectors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment ofthe special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of itsrecapitalization.    The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp<FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 sharesof super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corpand the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.    The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf ofHarcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as asubstantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pctconvertible debentures.    The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds bymore than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available fordividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulentconveyance.    The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclosethat one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which itterms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable torepay it.    Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share tostockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced anextensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimedat thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.    British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of therecapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing itsalternatives.    British Printing said it filed the suit after consultationwith its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourtfailed to disclose the effect of the special dividend onHarcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.    British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormousincrease effective on the June eight record date for thedividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable uponconversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convertdenbentures before the record date because Harcourt may nothave enough authorized common shares to honor conversion afterthe date.    British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrsworth of debentures.    The suit also alleges that management, the board ofdirectors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme ofentrenchment through a combination of selling to First BostonSecurities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertiblevoting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchaseprogram and the manner in which its financing has beenstructured.

COMPUTER ASSOC. <CA> BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM Computer Associates International Inc's800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp <UCE> will eliminate itsstrongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competitionfrom International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, Wall Streetanalysts said.     "IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systemssoftware," said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkinand Jenrette.    "But the combination of the two companies will clearlypresent a much stronger front," he said.    Besides IBM, "Computer Associates will be far and away themost powerful company in the field," added E.F. Hutton analystTerence Quinn.    That field is a segment of the market known as systemutilities, or software packages that boost the productivity ofa company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.    The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines thetwo biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms thatwill find the competition much harder than in the past.    For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps asix-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.    When the deal is completed sometime in August, thecompany's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past Microsoft Corp <MFST> as the world's largest independentsoftware vendor.    Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wangtook the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.    Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computerbusinesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframecomputer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after themerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of sixcompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, onsales of 141.5 mln dlrs.    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largelybecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from thedark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or56 cts a share.   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 differentbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computersoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and amajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from hisjob as chairman of General Electric Co's <GE> computer servicesunit.    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at anews conference that the merger would give computer users asingle source for a wide range of software products.    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates alsosell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroadsin the applications software market, where analysts said it hasbeen successful with accounting and banking systems.    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support andenhance both companies' product lines, but noted that thecompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He saidabout 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings ofcurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. Butthey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not diluteComputer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.    Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record ofcompleting acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05dlrs a share.    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operationsof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketingand research and development.    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said mostsoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 timesper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth thepremium because of its earnings potential and customer base.    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currentlyowns 58 pct of Uccel.    The executive said the merger would not alter his target ofmaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having thedeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. JusticeDepartment.    Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after themerger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang. Reuter
MAXWELL WOULD NOT RENEW BID IF SUIT FAILS British press magnate Robert Maxwell saidhis British Printing and Communication Corp Plc would not renewits bid for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc <HBJ> if the lawsuitfiled against Harcourt in New York today fails.

BILZERIAN PREPARED TO TENDER FOR PAY N'PAK <PNP> Investor Paul Bilzerian said if Pay N'Pak Stores Inc enters into a merger accord with him he willimmediately begin a tender offer for 7.5 mln shares for 20 dlrsper share in cash.    Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior toa leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by thecompany this morning.    The company said it is evaluating both proposals.Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted ata meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of PayN' Pak did were not immediately available for comment.     Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised byShearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and "wemay add a bank to that."    "We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign," hesaid. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would beexchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock.    Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group,which the company did not identify, topped his offer betweennow and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected anopportunity to respond.    Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but didsay the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreementregarding management's equity participation.    Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the managementparticpation was "nominal."    Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there wasdisappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs.    "We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22dlrs," said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pctcumulative preferred stock.    Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said "youhave to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid."    Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said thecompany has not made the best strategic moves over the years."They have not done the right things at the right time," hesaid, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declinedsince 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for thefiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings,he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mlndlrs.    Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales peoplethan many competitors, but it competes on price even thoughcompetitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins.He noted that there have been no other publicly identifiedbidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlierBilzerian proposal in mid-April.    Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late foranother bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someonein the same home improvement business might be able to offer adeal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal andBilzerian's plan. Reuter

USPCI <UPC> SEEN REJECTING UNION PACIFIC BID share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), analysts said.    "The offer is inadequate," said Douglas Augenthaler, ananalyst with E.F.

USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at48-1/8, down 3/8.    USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he couldnot comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the boardwould meet to consider it.    Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcementthat same day of higher earnings expectations changed itsvalue. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceedanalysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.    At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in thelow 40s, Augenthaler said.    Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the wastemanagement concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on theannouncment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.    In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste managementbusiness holds significant growth potential. The industry hasgrown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based onearnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with KidderPeabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.

ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING TOPS CRAZY EDDIE OFFER A quickly growing Texas-baseddistributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrsfor Crazy Eddie Inc <crzy>, the leading New York Cityelectronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than itsfounder has bid.    The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc <em>for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder EddieAntar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canadaannounced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.    Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues andprofits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into thehighly competitive New York City retail market for consumerelectronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes ofelectronics retailers have sagged.    The analysts questioned whether Houston-based EntertainmentMarketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whosepresent buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, hadthe management expertise for retailing or was merely trying todrive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.    "I have mixed feelings," said analyst Dennis Telzrow ofEppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. "On the one handit's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, doesEntertainment Marketing have the management talent to run itand will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"    "It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing," saidanalyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, aMinneapolis brokerage. "Electronics retailing is very managementconcentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management inplace."    Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing alreadyowns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it maybe trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its7-dlr-a-share offer.    Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid wasannounced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a sharein over-the- counter trading.     Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New YorkCity, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month thathis group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.    A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has takenno decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrssince they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. Hewould not comment on the new offer.    Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such asdisk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods toretailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly toconsumers by cable television.    In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profitwent to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.    Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said ina statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchaseof Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc toassist in financing the balance.    Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have toborrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout sinceCrazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the sameamount.    Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Mondayto 9.50. Reuter

INVESTORS MAY TAKE COMPUTERLAND PUBLIC The investor group that has agreed tobuy <Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personalcomputer retailer public or sell it to other investors,industry analysts said.    "Now's a good time," said Joe Levy of International DataCorp. "The personal computer industry has bottomed out and ison the way up again," he said.    Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PCretailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought byan investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.    Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management andventure capital firm, would disclose the value of thetransaction.    Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 storesgenerated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners payroyalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.    Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions toComputerland. Computerland officials could not immediately bereached for comment.    E.M.

BURLINGTON <BUR> HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW U.S. District Court Judge EugeneA. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow onBurlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stopSamjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.    Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case couldbe pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeoverbattle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.    Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyersfor Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by DominionTextile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.    Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminaryinjunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer untilthe case is decided.    Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlrbuyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS>, one dlr per sharelower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjenslast week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjensoffer.    Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman andDominion used illegally obtained confidential information aboutthe company in making their takeover attempt.     That information, Burlington said, was provided by JamesAmmeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebberGroup Inc <PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington'ssales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never todivulge inside information about the company.    Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he beganworking with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace itsmanagement," Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.    Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information fromPaineWebber, but argued the information was public informationand could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts orBurlington's public financial statements.    Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met withEdelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet withthem until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion wentpublic April 24 with their intention to take over the company.Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt atakeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board inFebruary.    Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion helddiscussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting asfinancial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke offbecause Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman anddominion with a written statement that they did not provideinside information.    Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeenwithdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairmanFrank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive andthreatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in aneffort to takeover Burlilgnton.    "The ultimate question is not the price per share or theprofit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct forthose who would takeover an American company," said burlingtonlawyer Humphrey.    Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as thelargest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be inviolation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada'slargest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plantsin Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,the lawyers said.    Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said themarket for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contendsand that Burlington has the ability to switch between lightweight and heavy weight denim production as demand and pricedictate.    Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed byBurlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bidfor Dominion. "Surely, what would have been sauce for the goosewould have been sauce for the gander," said Sidney Rosdeitcher,a Samjens lawyer. Reuter
EDELMAN DETAILS BURLINGTON <BUR> OPTIONS SALE A tender offer of Asher Edelman andDominion Textile Ltd <DTX.TO> for Burlington Idustries Inc isnot affected by the investors' sale of options to buyBurlington stock, according to an associate of Edelman.

EQUITICORP TASMAN TO BID FOR MONIER LTD <Equiticorp Tasman Ltd> (ETL) said it willoffer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital ofMonier Ltd <MNRA.S>, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs ashare bid by CSR Ltd <CSRA.S>.    Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 centscash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.    As previously reported, ETL moved into the market forMonier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct byFriday.    It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without ForeignInvestment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified asforeign because of its New Zealand base.    The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.    Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, thealternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said thevalue placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to thediluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.    ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptanceconditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investmentand U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.    ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that theshareholding in Monier was a long term investment.    ETL and its <Feltex International Ltd> associate havetargetted the building products sector as an area of expansionand Monier fits well with this aim, he added.    Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statementthat the independent directors of Monier intend to recommendacceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.    He also said Monier will not now proceed with theone-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results onMarch 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.    As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complexput and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder,Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, which gives Redland the choice ofaccepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.    CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redlandtaking the second option, resulting in the two companiesrunning Monier as a joint venture.    CSR officials have also said they had no intention ofraising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's interventionbecame public last week. REUTER

CSR SAYS IT IS PROCEEDING WITH OFFER FOR MONIER CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> intends to proceed withits planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd<MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from <Equiticorp Tasman Ltd>(ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters.    ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier'sissued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposedbid.    The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealandentrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pctstake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.    Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, which holdsjust under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid andhad told CSR it is not a seller.    He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on itsoperations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built upa strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.    The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement withRedland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within sixmonths of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in thesame period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.    CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.    ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyonddescribing it as a long term investment.    ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which isa leader in building materials, Herbert said.    "We fit better with Monier," he said.    CSR has said that it will concentrate development on itscore businesses of sugar and building materials after its movesinto energy several years ago.    Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbertsaid: "I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has towonder if Monier is the main target."    Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said ahigher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.    Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched itsoriginal bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.    The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents onyesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreignshareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment ReviewBoard (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.    Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likelyto accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judgethe respective values of ETL and CSR shares.    ETL is the third group to become involved in a possibleacquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on apossible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but thenegotiations foundered on the price.    Share analysts said that for this reason, they did notthink ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bidalthough Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.    "Redland is still in the driving seat," said Tim Cohen of<Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier havingCSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.

JUDGE TO DECIDE BURLINGTON <BUR> IN SEVERAL DAYS U.S. District Court Judge EugeneA. Gordon said he will decide "in the next few days" whether togrant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover bySamjens Acquisition Corp.    "I do not know how I come down on this preliminaryinjunction," Gordon said after listening to arguments byattorneys for 1-1/2 days.    "It's been a long time since I was deluged with as muchinformation as I have been. I have to consider what's beenpresented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot bewinners," he said.    Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeovereffort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegallyobtained confidential information about the company to make itsoffer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations ifSamjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc ofCanada, were to succeed.    Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer forBurlington from Morgan Stanley Group <MS> by one dlr per share.Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid72 dlrs per share for Burlington.    Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is notgranted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjenslawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would"kill the offer"    Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said thepartnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunctionwere granted. "There's only one Burlington," he said. "If wecannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us."    Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings inBurlington for 95 mln dlrs. "We don't want that. We're not inthis for the money," he said.    Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated thatinformation provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlingtonexecutive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt otakeover of Burlington.

It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end ofSeptember.    The limited partnership will be similar to the WestinHotels limited partnership completed last year when Allegissold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago. Allegisreported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of thatpartnership.

SPECTRA-PHYSICS <SPY> MULLS SALE, RESTRUCTURE Spectra-Physics Inc said it isconsidering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring,or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection ofan unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company alsosaid its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 topexecutives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their basesalary if they stay with the company through August 29.    In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiaryof Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair.    The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with twoCiba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject theSwiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanleyand Co Inc, that it is "inadequate and unfair from a financialpoint of view to the holders of shares," the company said.    The board also authorized a special committee and MorganStanley to "vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize anyalternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'investment in the company," the company said.    Among the alternatives the special committee will considerare a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, includingself tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use ofdividends, Spectra-Physics said.    The "retention plan" for the 52 top officers will pay anaverage bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said.    Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan "in orderto encourage key operating personnel to remain with the companyduring the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the(Ciba-Geigy) offer."    Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to theircash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasonsother than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave thecompany because their salaries have been sharply cut.    Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigyyesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., chargingit with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading inviolation of securities law and with violating the intent ofJuly 9, 1985 standstill agreement.    Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time ofthe standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicitedtakeover proposal for the company and that the intent of theagreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat.    Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and RelianceGroup Holdings <REL>, which is controlled by New York investorSaul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.

ARCO <ARC> SPIN-OFF SEEN AT 500 MLN DLRS Atlantic Richfield Co, considering aspin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, couldgain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analystsestimated.    Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points onrumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based onabout 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy wasvaluing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.    Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statementaround mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct ofthe unit, leading investors to take profits.    After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.    "It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhatdisappointing," said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. Hesaid rumors of the spin-off had been around "for a couple ofdays."    Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn'tgetting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and itsvalue was not reflected in the company's stock price.    Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein saidthe unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year andhe expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.    Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena sayschemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth aboutthree billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500to 600 mln dlrs.    Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stakebecause chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated thecompany would use the proceeds to pay down debt.    But he added the possibility remained the deal would fallthrough. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet beenpresented to its board.    The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billiondlrs.    Reuter

GILLETTE <GS> SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon GroupInc <REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for GilletteCo that could draw some big international players and in theprocess make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analystssaid.    Several hours before a regularly scheduled board ofdirectors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requestedconsent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs pershare. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed inNovember not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.    "I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette andmore interested in putting Gillette into play because he standsto make a ton of money," said Andrew Shore, analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. "In play" is a term used on Wall Street todescribe what happens when a company becomes an unwilingtakeover target.    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlongets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette throughNovember of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs pershare. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain ofthree yesterday.    The agreement would be calculated on the basis ofPerelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for asplit. For example, a deal between Gillette and some othercompany at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmenreturned telephone calls seeking comment.    "Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money ifsomeone else takes over Gillette," said Analyst Deepak Raj ofMerrill Lynch and Co. "I'm not saying that is going to happenbut Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45dlrs per share."    Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasonswhy Perelman may not be really interested in acquiringGillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlonprivate after acquiring control of the cosmetics company twoyears ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon'soperations. "He's trying to overhaul and improve the image ofthe dearptment store business." Another reason is that Revlonhas recently made two other acquisitions.    Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised ifsome company such as Unilever plc <UN.AS> or Procter and GambleCo <PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.    Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers forGillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc <HAN>,RJR Nabisco Inc <RJR>, American Brands Inc <AMB> and RalstonPurina Co <RAL>.    "Perelman is trying to put the company in play," said aWall Street arbitrageur. "He gets to share in the upside if thecompany is sold." Another arbitrageur said he expects Gilletteto resist Perelman's overture. "I can't see the boardconsenting, what has changed between November and now," hesaid.       Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on."Perelman never does anything without a fair amount ofcalculation," he said. But he added, "The Gillette board has tobe careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued byshareholders." Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.    According to a copy of Perelman's letter released byGillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive mergeragreement without any financing condition. He said CitibankN.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financialadviser. Reuter

SQUIBB <SQB> SAID NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING CETUS Robert Fildes, president and chiefexecutive of Cetus Corp <CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corpis not interested in buying Cetus.    Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus afive pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.    "This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a majormajority holder in Cetus," Fildes told Reuters in an interview."Squibb has not approached us with any indication that theywant to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kindof arrangement," said Fildes.    Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late commentsby Fildes.    Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the onlyone to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co <EK>and W.R. Grace <WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, butneither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.    Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnosticproducts and with Grace to develop agricultural products.    Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to developnew biotechnology products in several fields.       As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets butnot in North American and Western Europe.    "We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understoodthat Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business inNorth America and Europe," said Fildes.    He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has amajor joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of itsown in that market.       Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements withpharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its ownbusiness. Many large corporations have invested in smallbiotech firms.    But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has madein biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetusbecause it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationshipwith a large number of other biotechnology companies."       Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drugareas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to "keep thebiggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves."    Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used tobroaden the company's reach in such big money making areasas the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatorymarkets.    Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' researchover the next five years.       "Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research anddevelopment to make it happen, while the equity position partof the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of thispartnership," said Fildes.

STIFEL FINANCIAL SAID IT RECEIVED UNSOLICITE Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc officialswere not available for comment on market rumors that it isinterested in acquiring Reed International plc <REED.L>.    Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financialadviser, declined comment.    A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, saidthe rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt hasannounced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeoverattempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell."It's completelyinconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if theydrop the recapitalization," he said.    Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.    Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of aU.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought adeclaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011in light of the recapitalization.    Harcourt said in a statement this week that SalomonBrothers Inc <SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in thecase, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amountof the debenture. In addition, British Printing andCommunications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs faceamount, Harcourt said.    Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If thecourt decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.    Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is notrequired to issue common to debenture holders who did notconvert prior to June eight.

BARCO DIRECTORS APPROVE BUYOUT OFFER FRO Lloyds Bank Plc's <LLOY.L> decision towithdraw from making markets in Eurobonds and U.K. Governmentbonds (gilts) sent shivers down the spines of other marketparticipants but was viewed as prudent by banking analysts.    "It (the move) really isn't a surprise. They lost a lot ofmoney in the early stages of the gilt market and now they wantto cut their losses while they can," said Keith Brown, bankinganalyst at Greenwell Montagu.    "The question now is how many other gilt market makers willface a similar fate," one senior gilt market maker said.    Eurobond market participants were equally stunned. "They arethe first firm of that size I can remember to have pulled outof eurobond market making altogether," said a member of theAssociation of International Bond Dealers London staff.    Other Eurobond market participants said that while Lloydshad frequently changed the staff of some of its eurobondoperations, it was hard to believe they were in trouble.    With this action Lloyds, the third largest U.K. clearingbank, becomes the first U.K. clearing bank to withdraw from thegilt market following the Big Bang deregulation of the LondonStock Exchange in October.    Earlier this year Midland Bank Plc <MDBL.L>, the fourthlargest clearing bank, opted out of making markets in equitieson the grounds that the return did not justify the expense. Itcontinues as a market maker in gilts, however. In a preparedstatement, Lloyds Bank chief executive Brian Pitman said thebank had a "relatively small position in these two overcrowdedmarkets and we have decided to reallocate the resources toopportunities which promise a better return on our shareholdersinvestment."    Lloyds said it would maintain its presence in short-termsecurities trading, swaps and other treasury products.    Alan Moore, Lloyds Treasurer, told Reuters that thedecision was forward looking and followed a "strategic review" ofthe prospects for Lloyds in these markets. "We decided thereturn just was not attractive," he said.    Although the decision was made at a meeting of Lloyds boardthis morning, Moore said that it had been under considerationfor some time.    He denied that the move was a "reaction to events in thetrading room" although he acknowledged that the bank's giltoperations were not profitable in the early stages of the newmarket.    Greenwell's Brown noted that for all of 1986, LloydsMerchant Bank sustained a loss of 28 mln stg, most of which hesaid were accounted for by the Eurobond and gilt operations.For all of 1986, Lloyds reported a pre-tax profit of 700 mlnstg. "Lloyds is so big, it can easily absorb these losses," Brownsaid, noting that they are minuscule when compared with thebank's exposure to Latin America.    U.K. Clearing banks have come under pressure to increasetheir provisions against bad loans to third world countriessince Citibank announced plans to add three billion dlrs to itsprovisions in mid-May.    National Westminster Bank Plc <NWBL.L>, the largest of theclearers, became the first of the U.K. Clearers to followCiticorp's <CCI> move earlier this week when it said it wasadding some 466 mln stg to its sovereign debt provisions.    Lloyds has the second largest exposure to Latin Americaafter Midland Bank, the smallest of the four clearers.    Lloyds has said it is reviewing the situation and Mooredenied that today's action had any connection. "It is totallyunrelated," he said.    Trading in Eurobonds and gilts had ended by the time theannouncement was made. But market participants weredumbfounded.    "We only heard the news about 20 minutes before theannouncement. I had no idea it was coming. I don't know if Istill have job," said one trader at Lloyds who declined to beidentified. Lloyds' Moore said that the bank would do all itcould to redeploy the staff affected by the decision in otherparts of the bank. But even though Lloyds' share of thesemarkets was relatively small, other market participants,particularly in gilts, were unnerved.    One senior gilt market maker noted that the news comesduring a period when both gilt and Eurosterling markets havebeen battered by the lack of investor participation, followingthe June 11 U.K. general election.    Most firms had held long positions on expectations that areturn of the ruling Conservative party would prompt heavydemand. These expectations have failed to be met and bothmarkets have sustained sizeable losses since the election.    Lloyds has long been the subject of rumors that it wasexperiencing problems with its gilt operations and officialshave never denied that the early stages were unprofitable.    Gilt market sources suggested that one of the problemsfacing Lloyds on the gilt side was its decision to build up itsown team. It was the only clearer which did not purchase abroker or a jobber (middle man) in the run-up to Big Bang.    Under the old system, these functions have been conductedseparately but now market makers perform both tasks.    But even long before Big Bang, market makers had expresseddoubts that the gilt market would be large enough to sustain 27market makers, even if turnover increased substantially.    And with Lloyds withdrawal, many market makers believe thatsome of the remaining 26 may opt to bow out gracefully. Reuter

REED INTL DENIES BID APPROACH Reed International Plc <REED.L> deniedrumours on the U.K. Stock market that it was the target of atakeover bid and said it had received no approach.    "In view of the increase in our share price today, I want tomake clear that we have not received any bid approaches," Reed'schairman Leslie Carpenter said in a statement.

Such a move would have made Harcourt too big for BPCC totake it over, analysts added.

NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA President Reagan's nominee as toppoliceman for the nation's securities markets will inherit anagency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stockprice gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from theglobalization of financial markets.    David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor atNorthwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursdayto be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities andExchange Commission.    If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeedJohn Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a recordsix years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.    The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as itsinvestigators have probed into the most colossal insidertrading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.    The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed inrecent months as a growing number of well known traders andprominent investment banking firms have been charged withwrongdoing.    The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November afterIvan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stockspeculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigatorsand to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegalprofits after being charged with insider trading.    But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing newphenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred bycomputer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. The price gyrations havecombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedentedvolatility to some U.S. securities markets.    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by somelawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporatetakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeoverssteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreignexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundworkfor an international securities marketplace in which tradingoccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investmentopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforceU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financialdisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted tospur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency'sreview of hostile corporate takeovers.    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Huttoninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective tothe agency upon being named chairman in 1981.    In line with the views of other top administrationofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeoverbattles over new federal regulations.    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insidertrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases thattopped the agency's enforcement agenda during theadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted withRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely tosignificantly alter the commission's current priorities.    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of themlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though thatfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as theagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.    The agency is one of the few in the government thatactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the pastfew years because of fees it charges public companies,investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by thepresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firingfor policy differences alone.    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the samepolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget requesteach year instead of leaving this to the White House.    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its originsto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributedin large part to widespread trading on credit and attemptedmarket manipulations by large investment firms.    The agency requires public companies and investmentvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports ontheir financial condition and to disclose changes in theircondition any time they issue new securities.    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks toregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, andit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrialmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later tobecome the nation's 35th president.    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who servedfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon'sfirst term and was Reagan's director of the CentralIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

SEC SAYS CAMPEAU UNIT VIOLATED DISCLOSURE RULES The Securities and ExchangeCommission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptlydisclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart atakeover attempt by Campeau Corp.    In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and itslegal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and theagency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shoppingcenter developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau'stakeover offer.    Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrson Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.    On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board hadurged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs ashare, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shoppingcenters to DeBartolo, the SEC said.    Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who headsthe merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm ofSullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SECfiling to disclose the talks even though they had resulted insales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.    Securities law requires takeover target companies topromptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.    The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pctof Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs ashare from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headedby DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed atthwarting Campeau, the SEC said.    Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in anamended SEC filing, the agency charged.    Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover wasmade on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaintsaid.    DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle forcontrol of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in Octoberwhen it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutesafter it dropped its hostile tender offer.    The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federaljudge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake inAllied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.    The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joiningwith Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegaltender offer.    But the SEC brief was never filed since the case wasdropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.    In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they complywith reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.    Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since itbecame a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual andquarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt. Reuter

SAN FRANCISCO, NOT REGION, HURT BY RESTRUCTURING Corporate mergers and acquisitionsin and around San Francisco over the past seven years have hadonly a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, aleading business-backed organization said.    The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 businessfirms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in anine-county area found that San Francisco itself had sufferedsome ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surroundingcommunities had not.    Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area leftdue to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, butanother 21 firms were added to the list.    Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.During the period, only six located in the city achievedFortune 500 status.    Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director ofMcKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the studygrew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriouslyhurt the economic climate of northern California.    However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had beenlost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs werecreated during the period.    At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greaterrise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the restof the United States and California.    Council President George Keller, who also is chairman andchief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a newsconference that the region had difficulties in persuadingcompanies to locate there because of a fragmented localpolitical system.    But he said that because of the amenities of living in SanFrancisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in othermetropolitan area.    "It's a great place to run a business," he added, "but it'sa hell of a place to do business with government."    The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with GulfOil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from therestructuring activity.    Among the corporate headquarters lost during the periodwere Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;Cooke and Rolm.    Companies that grew enough during the period to make theFortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.    The study by the management consulting firm said that,partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growthin San Francisco has slowed since 1980.    In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadershiphad adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic andcharitable activities. Reuter

GENCORP <GY> TO SELL GENERAL TIRE Gencorp Inc and Continental AG ofHanover, West Germany, jointy announced they signed anagreement for Continental to buy Gencorp's General Tire Incsubsidiary for 650 mln dlrs in cash.    Under the agreement the companies said Continental willacquire General Tire, including its related domestic andforeign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for themedical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retiredon or before November 30, 1984.    The sale is expected to be completed on or before Novemberone and is subject to meeting certain conditions.    Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Lastyear, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9billion dlrs generated by its tire operations.    Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mlndlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operatingprofits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs.    GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retainabout 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tireemployees under the agreement.    Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale toreduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt.    In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by apartnership formed by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner andBrown with a restructuring program that included the purchaseof up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrsa share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs    As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it plannedto sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKOGeneral Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcastproperties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotivecomponents businesses.       Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrsin after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale ofseveral pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company,including general tire.    "The price paid for General tire would not cause us toreevaluate that estimate," said Tilden.    General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has fourtire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada.    In a statemnet, A. William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman saidthe sale of General Tire "represents a critical accomplishmentin our plan to restructure GenCorp."

A.H. ROBINS SAYS RORER GROUP MERGER PROPOSA Two leading Senate Republicans haveurged the White House to name Commodity Futures TradingCommission (CFTC) Commissioner Kalo Hineman to replace outgoingChairman Susan Phillips, congressional sources said.    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Sen.Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), ranking minority member on the SenateAgriculture Committee, both have endorsed Hineman for the topCFTC post, the sources said.    In addition, Lugar has urged White House Chief of StaffHoward Baker to recommend Mark Sullivan, White House associatepersonnel director, as CFTC commissioner, they said.    Phillips's departure July 24 will create a vacancy on thefive-person commission and require the White House to appoint anew chairman.    Earlier this month, Sullivan emerged as a leading candidateto replace Phillips, according to industry and congressionalsources.    But Sullivan's lack of experience in commodity markets hasbeen cited as a liability by industry representatives.

CITICORP <CCI> SAVINGS EXTENDS CALIFORNIA REACH Citicorp has extended its reachinto the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisitionof 50 of Sears Roebuck's <S> Sears Savings Bank branches,bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities,CitiCorp Savings said.    Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by theFederal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and showsits serious intent to penetrate the California market.    The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach intoSouthern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located.Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California.    "This marks our first major expansion in California,particularly in the south," said Citicorp Savings PresidentEdward Valencia, in a statement.    Thrift industry sources said they do not see a majornear-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, butdo expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor thanSears was in that market.    "We do believe they will be a better competitor thanSears," said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of HomeFederal Savings and Loan Association <HFD>, based in San Diego.    Banking industry sources said the move is viewed asgroundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the Californiamarket, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it tooperate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely toconvert the branches to banks at that time.    In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billiondlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force inthe thrift market, against such large California thrifts asHome Federal, Great Western Financial Corp <GWF>, H F Ahmansonand Co <AHM>, Golden West  Financial <GWD> and Great AmericanFirst Savings Bank <GTA>.

BANK OF NEW YORK REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR IRVING <V> The Bank of New York Corp <BK> said itreaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despitethe drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, aBank of New York spokesman said.    "The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer," aBank of New York spokesman said.    Irving would not comment on how the drop in the marketaffects its position on the bid or whether it would buy backany of its own shares.    Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequateand said it wanted to retain its independence.    In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs pershare in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for oneIrving share.    At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs pershare for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.    According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tenderfor all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.    Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop wouldaffect the acquisition.    "If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approveit, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.    "And the market is saying the deal won't go through,"Alpert said.    "The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed atpresent. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs ashare, then they won't go at a lower price," another analystsaid.    The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could affordto retain its original offer.    However, industry sources were more uncertain aboutprospects for the deal.    "With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer willlook good to Irving shareholders," said Michael Flores, aconsultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.    The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which isabout a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increasesthe chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.    Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likelyto depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the bankingindustry.    "Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't usetheir own stock to make acquisitions because their share priceis too depressed," Alpert said.    Since only banks can buy another bank, the only otherpossible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.    "In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobberedmore than the acquirees," another analyst said. Reuter

IBC ACQUISITION GETS 8,857,807 SHARES IN TENDER, TO BUY  Today's sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks andmatching falls around Europe may have been overdone, but themood on financial markets is precarious, Swiss securitiesanalysts and economists said.    Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the openingon enormous volume, triggered by the slide on Wall Street andthe threat of renewed currency instability.    "I have never experienced anything like this, and I've beenin the business for 20 years," said Bernhard Wyttenbach, head ofEuropean research at Union Bank of Switzerland.    The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on U.S. Monetaryauthorities. This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakerpublicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetarypolicy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilisecurrencies was still working, but added: "On the other hand, wewill not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interestrates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the UnitedStates will raise rates."    Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) inZurich said: "The situation is very dangerous. Statements by theU.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates."    Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank'sfinancial research department, called the sell-off "overdone,"but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banksloosen their monetary policy.    "I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over," hesaid. "The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step inwith an easy money policy, or else there is going to be aneconomic catastrophe. They have to act quickly."    Wyttenbach said the "Black Monday" sell-off was clearlyexaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participationcertificates falling 20 pct in value at one point.    But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correctionwould come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investorsonly in time for tomorrow's market, when there could beanother, smaller selling wave.    "As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key --then we'll get a strong movement upward," Wyttenbach said. Butthat may not come soon.    "People are simply worried that in America, where the markethas now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,"he said. "People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988."    Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the currentproblems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. "We do not have amark problem, we have a dollar problem," he added, but said thebiggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. FederalReserve Board, Alan Greenspan.    Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that thedollar might be too high in the medium term and that interestrates might have to rise. "As a central banker he shouldn't dothat," Wyttenbach said. "There is a danger that we will fall backinto the 1970s," he said. "We have a real crisis of confidence inGreenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker."    Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11.    Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: "I'm relatively optimisticbecause the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has tointervene."    He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to takeany significant steps, adding that the focus of attentionremains on the United States.    "The panic started in New York, it has to end there."    The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggestingthey not sell into a panicked market, but wait a while beforedeciding what to do.
