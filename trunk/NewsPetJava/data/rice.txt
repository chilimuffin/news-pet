INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW Indonesia"s agriculture sector will growby just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pctin 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates ordeclines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.    Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast tofall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report onIndonesia"s agricultural performance.    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in1987.    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mlntonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because ofa drawdown on stocks.    "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not lookpromising as rice production is forecast to decline and theproduction of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or nogain," the report says.    "The modest overall increase which is expected will be dueto significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oiland palm kernels."    Constraints to significant overall increases inagricultural output include a shortage of disease resistantseeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance byfarmers to shift from rice production to other crops, thereport underlines.    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak ofpests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 whichlargely offset gains in yields.    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are nowresistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, moreresistant rice types.    The government is depending on increased production ofexport commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood andpalm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crudeoil prices.    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pctin 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports risingto an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, thereport says.    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) willrise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports willalso rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybeanmeal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of lastSeptember"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a risein domestic demand.    The report said that Indonesia"s overall economicperformance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slightnegative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pctin 1984.    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsiblefor the slump. REUTER
USDA WOULD SCRAP COTTON, RICE, BEAN PRICE FLOORS The package of proposed farm policychanges that the Reagan administration sent to Congress todayincludes a provision that would eliminate minimum price supportlevels for upland cotton, rice and soybeans.    The package, obtained by Reuters, also includes aprovision, outlined in advance by USDA officials, that wouldincrease the annual permissible cut in the basic price supportlevels for all major crops to 10 pct from five pct.    Under current law, the basic support prices for uplandcotton, rice and soybeans between 1987 and 1990 cannot be cutbelow 50 cents per lb, 6.50 dlrs per hundredweight and 4.50dlrs per bushel, respectively.

THAILAND REDUCES MAIN RICE CROP PROJECTION Thailand's main paddy crop is expectedto fall to 15.4 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 (Nov/Oct) season froma previous 15.68 mln estimate in November and an actual 17.35mln a year ago, the Thai Rice Mills Association said.    It said a joint field survey late last month by theassociation, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailandindicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region islower than expected because of a drought in several provinces.    The association said rice growing areas in NakhonRatchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam wereespecially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of1986.    It said last November that the drought reduced totalnational areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares thisyear, down from 8.84 mln a year ago.    The main crop represents about 85 pct of Thailand's paddyoutput. REUTER

JAPAN FIRM PLANS TO SELL U.S. FARMLAND TO JAPANESE A Japanese real estate companysaid it will launch a campaign to sell land in U.S. Farmingareas to rich Japanese.    Higashi Nippon House said it would offer around 2,200 acresof land in Illinois, California, Florida and Indiana from earlyApril to gauge response. It set up International Farm Corp ofAmerica in Chicago last September to oversee the operation.    American farmers would continue as working tenants and partof the profits from harvests of rice, corn, soybean and orangeswould go to the Japanese investors as rental.    Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials told Reuters saleswere limited to farmers to keep land in agricultural use.    "Two years ago, I began to seek my own farmland in Japan,"said Isao Nakamura, president of Higashi Nippon. "However, saleof Japanese farmland is strictly controlled by the government,so I began to look for the land in the U.S to make my dream toown farm land come true."

U.S. TO ASK FOR SHARE OF JAPAN'S RICE MARKET U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice marketto U.S. exporters when he visits that country next month.    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said the Reaganadministration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on U.S. beefand citrus exports.    Lyng, who plans to be in Japan April 14-27, said he willnot ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market. "We will urgethat they consider sharing their rice market," he said.    The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of theJapanese rice market the U.S. would request. "We've got none ofit now. If we got one per cent of it, it would be a bigimprovement," he said.    Last year, the Reagan administration rejected a petition bythe U.S. rice industry seeking relief from Japanese importrestrictions.    However, the U.S. said it would reexamine the issue if bymid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to U.S. riceexports.    Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiationsnext month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas, butthat his visit "may be a forerunner in a general way" to talksprior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988.    He said, however, that the U.S. "will ask for a definiteliberalization of those items (beef and citrus).... When youtranslate 'liberalization' into Japanese, it means do away withthe quota." Reuter
U.S. MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE-BOSCHWITZ A marketing loan for U.S. wheat,feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplusproduction situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. RudyBoschwitz (R-Minn.) said.    "I think I would not support a marketing loan now," he toldthe House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans andfeedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of amarketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focusedsupport on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.    A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage moreproduction, especially in high-yielding areas, would be muchmore expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loansand not increase exports significantly, he said.

KAMPUCHEA SAYS RICE CROP IN 1986 INCREASED Kampuchea harvested more than two mlntonnes of rice paddy in 1986, up on the crops of the previoustwo years, the official SPK news agency said yesterday.    Diplomats said estimates put the 1985 harvest at less thanone mln tonnes, slightly up on 800,000 in 1984.    SPK said Kampuchea planned to expand planting from 1.5 mlnto 1.93 mln hectares and boost rice paddy output to 2.5 mlntonnes this calendar year.    Two mln tonnes of paddy would produce some 1.3 mln tonnesof milled rice, above the 1.25 mln tonnes Kampuchea says is theminimum its 7.5 mln people need. REUTER

CHINA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA Light, scattered showers coveredwinter wheat areas in the North China Plain in the week endedMarch 14, moistening topsoils for wheat, just breaking dormancyin most central and northern areas, the Joint AgriculturalWeather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and CommerceDepartments said.    In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agencysaid southern winter wheat areas are in the early vegetativestage. Above-normal February temperatures over the North ChinaPlain caused winter grains to break dormancy early in thesouth.     Moderate to heavy rains in southern Jiangsu, Anhui,eastern Hebei, Hunan , Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zheziang, reversedFebruary's below normal precipitation pattern.    The agency said the wet weather in these areas providedample moisture for rice planting and lessened the need forirrigation.

Grains usuaually break dormancy in March.    Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy inearly April, it said.    Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areasof northern Pakistan and northern India, it said.    Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in centralIndia and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas bylate April.    Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India,reversing February's below-normal trend.    Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in mostsouthern areas, it said.    In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to thecentral islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzonand southern Mindanao.

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS Three geographically diverse droughtsin Asia are being linked by some scientists to areintensification of the complex and little-understood El Ninoweather pattern, <Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weatherforecasting service, said.    Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcanegrowers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all faceserious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrivein time to break the droughts, offical reports, governmentofficials and meteorologists said.    Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, saidthe drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinceshave been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.    Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.    Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuanwas 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure forover 20 years, the paper said.    The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pctcompared with last March and lowered the water levels of manyrivers, it added.    This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causingshortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of theYangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing manyships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.    Unusually high temperatures have also been reported acrossChina, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan hasrecorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than averagesince early February.    The New China News Agency said the average Decembertemperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higherthan last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.    Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lankaand threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry ofPlantation Industries officials told Reuters    In Australia, concern is growing about below-averagerainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along theQueensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, localMeteorological Bureau officials said.    For many farmers and government officials the fear is thatwhile the present low rainfall does not yet pose a majorthreat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when thewheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.    Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 droughtwhich devastated the wheat crop and coincided with theoccurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known asEl Nino, they said.    Although meteorologists are cautious about linking theAsia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any singlecause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.    Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data foragriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event'was unique.    The El Nino does not always produce the same effects andthe present occurrence is much less pronounced than the lastmajor event in 1982/83, it said.    El Nino, Spanish for "Christ Child" because it appears aroundChristmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing cloudsand rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coastof Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated withthe Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the tradewinds, meteorologists said.    The winds, strengthened by El Nino's "pump" effect, raise thesea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.    When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sendsa surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where itcollides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.    One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect therain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into thePacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.    The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weathersaid.    China, where the affected areas have received between 40and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for theMay-September rains, it said.    The May-September rains normally provide thedrought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.    In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip havereceived less than half the normal rainfall during the currentwet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishingas the rainy season draws to an end.    In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should beat its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usuallyoccur between April and June, although it is not possible atthis stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual. REUTER
CONCERN OVER "EL NINO" IN PERU - USDA REPORT There are heightened fears that "ElNino" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continentsand caused widespread damage through floods and drought, theU.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Lima said in a fieldreport.    Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area,flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led toincreased concern, the report, dated March 17, said.    However, it said official sources still believe that thisyear's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.    EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds andwaters in the pacific.    The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now beingexperienced has not had an overall negative impact onagricultural production.    Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduceyields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in thecrop cycle.    Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive whereexcessive moisture exists, it said.    However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supplyof irrigation water in the major dams which will improveprospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, andslow the decline in sugar production, it said.    If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru's fishing industry couldreceive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fishcatch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said.    Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are threeto four degrees centigrade above normal but still not highenough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said.    It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino willintensify and carry on through late March, April and Maycausing problems as crops approach harvest.    "There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino-- only time will tell," the report said. Reuter

SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countriesfor emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by thecountry's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.    Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aidneeded for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.    The letter said the government had to step in "to avertserious economic hardship" and because the Social ServicesMinistry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provisionof 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.    The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a sixmonth period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice cropwas harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour andother cereals were required, it said, along with supplies ofsugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.    In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha(October 1986-April 1987) crop had been "almost completelydevastated," the letter said. Maha paddy output was nowestimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originallyexpected.    There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a highforecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequaterainfall within the next three to four weeks.    "Should the present drought continue, however, production isestimated at around 20 mln bushels," the letter added.    Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Lastyear's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.    The letter said villagers in most seriously affecteddistricts had been deprived of any means of subsistence becausesubsidiary crops had also failed.    It said the government's current budget did not permit itto provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected."Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodityprices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continueto exert pressure on the expenditure side."    The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees permonth for each family, as well as handling, transport anddistribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds bythe government would not be possible without seriouslyimpairing development projects, or "greatly fuelling inflation"in the economy, the letter said.    The letter said the Food Department would be able torelease wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet theimmediate cereal requirements "provided such stocks are replacedsubsequently."    The Meteorological Department said the country wasexperiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-monthdry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break whenthe monsoon rains fell in late May.    The letter said some areas had been experiencing thedrought since August, and in the rice growing district ofKurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June1986. Reuter
DROUGHT THREAT EASES IN SOUTH CHINA PROVINCE Rainfall in the past few days has easedthe threat of drought in the south China province of Guangdong,the New China News Agency said.    It said 75 pct of early rice fields are ready to be plantedand seedlings have already been transplanted on 90 pct of ricefields in Hainan island. Some 840,000 hectares of farmland havebeen planted with cash crops including sugar cane, peanuts andsoybeans, 67,000 ha more than in 1986.    The provincial government has increased investment in grainand taken effective measures to combat natural disasters thisyear, the agency said, but gave no further details. REUTER
CHINA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA Moderate to heavy rain continuedover early double-crop rice areas in eastern Guangxi,Guanghdong, eastern Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang in theweek ended March 28, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility ofthe U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.    In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agencysaid The moisture lessened the need for irrigation. Moisturefor early rice planting is adequate to abundant in most areas,and inundative rain in Guangdong and southern Jiangxi may havewashed out some rice fields requiring replanting.     Light showers in southern Sichuan increased topsoilmoisture for corn planting, which likely is off to a slow startdue to earlier dryness, it said.    In the North China Plain, dry weather covered winter wheatin the vegetative stage, and rain is needed to meet increasingcrop moisture requirements, it said.    Weekly temperatures in the North China Plain were nearnormal, the agency noted. Reuter
USDA AGAIN EXTENDS FARM OPERATING PLAN DEADLINE The U.S. Agriculture Department saidit has extended until April 17 the date by which AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation county offices must determineeligibility of individuals or other entities for payments under1987 farm programs.    Jerome Sitter, director of ASCS's Cotton, Grain and RicePrice Support Division, said the decision meant farmers haveuntil April 17 to file a farm operating plan indicating howmany persons would be involved in their farming operations.    Earlier this year USDA extended the deadline to April 1from March 1, Sitter said.    ASCA Administrator Milton Hertz said in a statement thatthe extension was necessary because of heavy workloads atcounty ASCS offices.    Hertz said ASCS county officials "have had to make a largenumber of eligibility determinations for individuals and otherentities, such as corporations and partnerships, in preparationfor imposing the 50,000-dlr-per-entity cap."    "These offices already had a very heavy workload due to thelarge number of applications for both the 1987 farm programsand the Conservation Reserve Program," Hertz said. Reuter
CCC CREDITS FOR MEXICO SWITCHED TO WHEAT--USDA The Commodity Credit Corporation(CCC) has switched 10 mln dlrs in credit guarantees to Mexicoto cover purchases of U.S. wheat, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment said.    The credit guarantees were previously earmarked for salesof U.S. dry edible beans and rice, it said.    The action reduces the guarantee lines previouslyauthorized of dry edible beans to by five mln dlrs to 45 mlndlrs and for rice from five mln to zero and increases coveragefor wheat sales from five mln to 15 mln dlrs.

LOWER U.S. RICE STOCKS, STRONG EXPORTS - USDA Rising demand for U.S. rice maygradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should helpincrease the U.S. share of the world rice market despitesluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, thedepartment said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mlnhundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt onJuly 31.    Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage isexpected to decline this year, the report said.    USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grainacreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grainrelative to long grain have increased, the loan differentialhas been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yieldsrelative to those of other classes have leveled off.    With the drop in domestic prices resulting from themarketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at afaster rate, USDA said.    "Development of new products and increased promotion havehelped make rice more available and visible to a wider range ofconsumers," USDA said.    USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 becauseof large production and stocks but a weaker market shouldaffect competing exporters more than the U.S.    "The United States has already recovered a substantial shareof the European Community market and made inroads into marketsin the Middle East and Africa," the report said.    World rice consumption is projected to reach record levelsin 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes,increased domestic production and low import prices haveallowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarsegrains.    China, India and South Korea have increased output, whilethe Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since themid-1970s, the report said. Reuter
TURKEY ELIGIBLE FOR U.S. BONUS RICE The U.S. Agriculture Department saidTurkey has been made eligible for the sale of up to 70,000tonnes of medium grain milled rice under the department'sexport enhancement program, EEP.    As with the 65 previous EEP initiatives, the export saleswould be subsidized with commodities from the inventory of theCommodity Credit Corp and made at competitive world prices,USDA said. Reuter
OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF FAMINE IN BANGLADESH The failure of the Bangladesh governmentto tackle the country's current food crisis could lead to afamine, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, KhaledaZia, told a press conference yesterday.    Prices of rice rose by at least 25 pct across the countryin March and the government has begun emergency rice and wheatsales to lower cereal prices, a food ministry report said.    Ministry officials said the next harvest, due in mid-Aprilwill ease the situation. "Temporary grain shortage in the aridnorth and some other rain-starved regions is not unusual atthis time of the year," one official said.    Khaleda, said corrupt practices by food officials andfailure to procure enough grains contributed to the crisis. Herremarks coincided with newspaper reports that a continuing heatwave has destroyed thousands of acres of crops in thesouth-west.    Officials said last week Bangladesh now has only 390,000tonnes of grain in stock which would be exhausted in two orthree weeks. Bangladesh expects to produce 14.5 mln tonnes ofrice and 1.5 mln tonnes of wheat in 1986/87 ending June 30. Itrevised its food import target for this fiscal year upward by300,000 tonnes to 1.8 mln.

THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion ayear ago, the Business Economics Department said.    It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion bahtfrom 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate thisyear resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materialsand semi-finished products.    The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in thefirst quarter due to lower oil prices.    The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6billion baht from 56.6 billion.    Export growth was smaller than expected due to lowerearnings from many key commodities including rice whoseearnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26pct and canned pineapples seven pct.    Products registering high export growth were jewellery up64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct. REUTER
JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S. Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market," he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table," the officialsaid. REUTER
GATT OFFICIAL MEETS WITH U.S. FARM LEADERS The official in charge ofagricultural matters in the new round of global trade talks isin Washington today and tomorrow to meet with congressional andReagan administration officials.    Aart de Zeeuw, chairman of the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade's negotiating group on agriculture, met this morningwith members of the House Agriculture Committee.    Committee sources said De Zeeuw expressed concern overprotectionism and high farm price supports. House lawmakersnoted that in 1985 the United States took steps to reduce loanrates, committee staff said.    "Members told him (De Zeeuw) that we lowered our (U.S.) loanrates and can't eliminate subsidies unilaterally," one sourcesaid.    De Zeeuw was told of the U.S. lawmakers' frustration withJapan's restrictive rice import policy, and members defendedthe U.S. dairy policy, which aims to cut surplus production bysubsidizing producers to trim herds, sources said.    Later today De Zeeuw will meet the Senate Agriculturemembers and Undersecretary of State Affairs Allen Wallis.    Tomorrow, De Zeeuw is to meet the House Ways and MeansTrade Subcommittee and the Senate Finance Committee, beforevisiting Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng.    De Zeeuw goes to Canada later this week. His trip to NorthAmerica is part of his attempt to meet farm policy leaders inthe key GATT member states.

JAPAN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON RICE TALKS REPORT The Agriculture Ministry declined commenton a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talkson its closed rice market in the new GATT round.    "We have no idea about the report and cannot comment," aspokesman told Reuters.    Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngand U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of itsintentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month forfarm talks.    The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issueat the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradetalks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.    Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the FoodstuffControl Act.    Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries aboutmounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japanwill try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy isjustified, it said.    The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay traderound last September. It will take four years to negotiate. REUTER

DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS A prolonged dry spell has damaged111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provincesin the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officialssaid.    They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produceestimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack ofrainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailingconditions continued until next month.    Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped thelosses would be offset by the expected increase in output inother, normally more productive areas not affected by the dryspell.    Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.    About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.    Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has beenhit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national totalthus the damage is considered negligible.    In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled byproduction from non-traditional corn farms which diversifiedinto the cash crop from sugar two years ago.     The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut productionin the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were noreports of actual damage.

The paper said the price paid for corn from 14 northernprovinces, cities and regions has increased by one yuan per 50kg. A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take theprice to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.    The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10southern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.    The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwestChina has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave nomore price details.    It said local authorities must inform farmers of the priceincreases before farmers begin planting, to encourageproduction of grains and oilseeds.    Chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to growgrain because they can earn more from other crops. REUTER

LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngopens talks with Japanese government officials today well awarehis demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrusmarkets is likely to be rejected.     But in an interview with Reuters during the flight toTokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw aninternational spotlight on Japan's agricultural importprotection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to openits markets.    "(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, butthey are not going to give us anything," Lyng said.    U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessionsduring Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessionswould be unveiled later this month, they said.    "If there is anything of consequence to offer (PrimeMinister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him," when hevisits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports bypartially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last weekrequesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial usessuch as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, sayingTokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota forbeef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers wouldlike to buy much more beef than currently allowed.    He cited the example of a California company whichtransports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter tocircumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher thanthe value of the animal, he said.    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry PromotionCorporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrowfrom the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japanhas said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan toeliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice byApril, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventuallybe willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges becauseliberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanesemandarin orange industry.    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate becauseimports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. AndJapanese officials have said.   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buysurplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks inGeneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certainminor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals. REUTER

JAPAN RICE POLICY EXTREME PROTECTIONISM, LYNG SAYS Japan's policy of self-sufficiency inrice is an example of extreme protectionism, visiting U.S.Agriculture secretary Richard Lyng told a press conference.    He told the National Press Club of Japan that because Japanhad a large export balance, not just with the U.S. But withother countries, it was inconsistent for it to be 100 pctself-sufficient in one product.    Speaking after farm trade talks with Japan agricultureminister Mutsuki Kato, Lyng said the U.S. Had not asked fortotal liberalisation of the rice market in Japan.    Lyng urged Japan to allow some imports of rice.    "We want to have some access in the rice market," he said.    He said both he and trade representative Clayton Yeutterwere disappointed at the outcome of talks with Japan. He toldreporters Japan had rejected the U.S. Proposal to opennegotiations on rice at the new round of trade talks at theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Lyng said he suggested instead bilateral talks with Japanon rice.    Kato has said Japan cannot negotiate on its policy of riceself-sufficiency.    Asked what the next U.S. Step would be on the rice issue,Lyng said he did not know what Yeutter or the U.S. Riceindustry would do.    Yeutter has promised to consider again in July or Augustthis year a complaint against Japan's rice import ban by theU.S. Rice Millers Association if no breakthrough is made in themeantime.    U.S. Rice industry officials have indicated they wouldconsider filing another complaint against the Japan rice importban. REUTER
LYNG WARNS U.S. TRADE SITUATION IS EXPLOSIVE (RPT) U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngsaid Japanese government officials do not seem to understandthat protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Could lead to anexplosive situation and protectionist legislation.    Speaking to the National Press Club of Japan, Lyng saidprotectionist sentiment in the U.S. Has increased alarminglyduring the last six months.    "It is a radically changed situation and is very explosive.We are on the verge of some very harsh mandatory retaliatorylaws which would have very serious consequences for othercountries, especially Japan," Lyng told reporters.    Lyng's comments about protectionist trade legislationappeared to be a reference to the so-called Gephardt provision,requiring retaliation against countries which have tradesurpluses with the U.S., Trade analysts said.    U.S. House majority leader Thomas Foley, a WashingtonDemocrat, yesterday predicted during a visit here that theGephardt provision will be approved by the House when tradelegislation is taken up later this month.    Senior Japanese officials do not seem to perceive thevolatility of the situation in the U.S., Where Congress isincreasingly unpredictable, he said.    "The purpose of this trip is to emphasise the fact thatpatience is beginning to be very much frayed in Washington. Icannot emphasise that enough," Lyng said.    In talks with Japanese Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Katoyesterday, Lyng and Trade representative Clayton Yeutter askedJapan to begin negotiations on its rice policy and end importquotas on beef and citrus.    Lyng said he was disappointed Kato rejected the U.S.Request but hoped it would not lead to a protectionist responsein Congress, where legislation on rice retaliation has beenintroduced in both the House and Senate.    Lyng said the U.S. Is dependent on Japan as a market forexports because Japan has been the largest buyer of U.S. Farmproducts since 1964, especially grains.    He said the U.S. Understands Japan, with a limited landarea, is concerned about maintaining some level ofself-sufficiency in food for national security reasons.    But he argued the freeing of farm product imports would notnecessarily weaken Japanese agriculture.    Lyng pledged the U.S. Will never again embargo shipments offarm products as it did in 1973.

NORTHERN VIETNAMESE RICE CROP THREATENED Insects are threatening to destroy367,000 hectares or about one-third of the spring rice crop innorthern Vietnam, Hanoi radio reported.    Drought has hit another 189,000 hectares, with 40,000hectares very badly affected, it said.    Insecticides are in short supply so only the mostendangered rice fields should be sprayed, the radio added.    The affected areas -- the Red River delta and other coastalareas in northern Vietnam -- produce between 30 to 40 per centof the country's rice.    The radio report, monitored in Bangkok on April 20 but onlytranslated here over the weekend, said the threatened damagewas spread over twice as large an area as last year.    Vietnam has not been able to grow enough food for itsexpanding population, with the Soviet Union buying rice inThailand and Burma in recent years for supply to Vietnam.    Vietnam produced 18.2 million tonnes of food, most of itrice, last year and hopes to boost that to 23-24 million tonnesby 1990. REUTER
THAILAND TO SEEK CLARIFICATION ON U.S. RICE PRICES Thailand will this week seekclarification from the U.S. About its decision to freeze riceexport prices from January to early April, Commerce MinisterMontri Pongpanich said.    Montri told reporters he will seek a meeting with U.S.Ambassador William Brown to determine why the U.S. Failed toset its weekly rice prices in accordance with rising worldprices during the period.    He said the U.S. Has followed a policy of weakening worldrice prices by announcing highly subsidised export prices lowerthan those quoted by Thai traders.    Thai officials said weekly rice prices as announced by theU.S. Agriculture Department were unchanged for 11 weeks up toApril 8.    Thailand, a major rice exporter, has criticised the U.S.Farm Act which provides heavy subsidies to U.S. Exportersenabling them to compete with Thai exporters.    Thai officials said average export prices of Thai rice fell19 pct last year and another 5.8 pct during the first quarterthis year.    The Board of Trade said Thailand exported 1.23 mln tonnesin January/March, down from 1.29 mln a year ago.    It said the export decline was partly due to the reluctanceof Thai traders to accept all foreign orders as world pricesdid not rise in line with firming domestic prices.    The board said, however, that Thailand may export more ricelater this year, especially to Africa, the Middle East andAsia, due to lower production in many drought affected Africancountries and to expected small exportable surpluses in Burmaand Pakistan.    It said Thai rice exports to nine major African buyers roseto 351,889 tonnes during the first quarter from 93,038 a yearearlier. REUTER
BOMB THREATS, STRIKES AS FIJI SEES END TRADE BAN Fiji today welcomed the ending of a tradeban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of thecountry's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressurefor his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.    The government welcomed a decision by the AustralianWaterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments toFiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-electedgovernment was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.    The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat,fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the uniondecision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of riceand wheat from an Australian port, the government said.    Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country's sugarindustry, closed again today in support of Bavadra.    In Nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of theAustralian Westpac bank, but police said they turned out to bea hoax.

JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO LIBERALISE FARM MARKET Japan has no plans to liberalise its farmmarkets, but will try to narrow the gap between the price offarm products at home and overseas, Agriculture MinisterMutsuki Kato said.    He told reporters the move is aimed at deflecting criticismof Japanese protectionism on its agricultural goods.    But Kato said he has no plans to start bilateral tradetalks with the United States over rice, Japan's staple food.    Washington has called Tokyo's rice policy an extremeexample of protectionism and has demanded access for U.S.Growers to the Japanese market. This is closed to importsexcept in emergency.    Kato said Japanese farmers should however "shed some blood,"to relieve the dangerous state of international farm trade.    His comments precede a meeting on July 1 and 2 of the RicePrice Council at which the government advisory body willdiscuss the 1987 crop producer rice price.    Kato said he welcomed the outcome of last week's recentsummit of leaders of leading industrialised democracies inVenice and of farm trade talks at the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) in May.    Ministers at both conferences agreed on the long-term needto cut subsidies worldwide, Kato said.    Kato said that Japan is not the only country to protectproducers. He said the United States spends some 25.8 billiondlrs a year to support producer prices and on its exportenhancement program and the EC 21.7 billion, while Japan spendsonly 2.9 billion. He said that although Japan provides theworld's highest level of subsidies per acre, its subsidy perfarm family was several times lower than in the United States.    Expressing concern about growing protectionist moves inU.S. Congress, he said Japan should make efforts to preventfarm trade issues between the two countries from becoming afactor increasing protectionism in the United States.    Japan and the United States are holding panel discussionsat the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over Japan'simport restrictions on 12 farm items.    Bilateral talks on beef and citrus trade in the period fromnext April are due to start this autumn. REUTER
INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS Indonesia rejected World Bankrecommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, asthe country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarksdistributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations metat The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bankfor this free trade, open economy view is weak."    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages thelargest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agriculturalgrowth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peakedand the subsidies are a waste of money.    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and providesan income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies wereneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well asassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmersshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said thegovernment would continue to maintain production targets for"strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia'sdrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are doublethe world average because of inefficiencies, and the countrywould save money by importing the commodity.    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the needto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugarindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in theagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industrydevelop and because of "over-production and price interventionin the developed nations."

GHANA LIFTS RICE/MAIZE IMPORT BAN DUE TO DROUGHT Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maizeimports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.    Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchweymade the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnesof rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aidprogramme.    The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, followsgovernment concern over "lower than average rainfall in southernGhana and its implications for the major harvest."    Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growingareas throughout the south this year. The Ministry ofAgriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in allmajor staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.    GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequencesof current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the droughtexperiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps toalleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.    The failure of seasonal rains has already seriouslyaffected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in partsof the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers havedried up. Reuter

Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free importof cotton yarn.    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton andrice along with the state corporations.

PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS Pakistani government allowed freercotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimedat narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech the government had also decided to allowduty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industrymore competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export ofPakistani products.       Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s.    But Haq said now the private sector would also exportcotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets along-standing demand of the local traders.    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed tobring down prices and help the local ancillary industriescompete effectively in the world market, he said.       Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years butreviewed every year.    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcingtrade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it wouldenable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over alonger period.    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been providedfor the export of engineering goods to selected third worldcountries on soft credit terms.       Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 percent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.    He said the government policy was to rationalise andstreamline import controls.    "It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, localindustry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs," hesaid. "Prices have been on the increase and quality of goodsproduced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave riseto smuggling and hampering of exports."       He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freedfrom import restrictions.    Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely fromremittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in theGulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after thedrop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of abalance of payments crisis for Pakistan. Reuter
