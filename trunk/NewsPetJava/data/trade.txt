BRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY inflationplan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of theeconomy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaringprices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed thevalue of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespreadindexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250pct inflation rate.    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.    "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there wasinflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bankeconomist said.    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by adramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient tocover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlrforeign debt.    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be ontarget for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging onebillion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and importsincreased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplusplunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averagedunder 150 mln. Reuter

JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-leveltrade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides aregrowing increasingly irritated with each other.    The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review thewhole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the wayfor American Secretary of State George Schultz's one daystop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.    Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action toreduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.    "We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanesegovernment official said. "But we are also frustrated."    The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slashspending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,but it will, he said.    He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progressthat has been made and instead emphasizing the problems thatremain when it talks with Congress.    "It would only take five minutes to list theiraccomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied.    The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on theeconomic structures of both countries and how they affect thebilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48billion dlrs in Japan's favour.    On the following two days, the topics will range frommultilateral trade talks under the auspices of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral tradeproblems as super computers.    The structural talks are intended to be free-wheelingdiscussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics includesavings and investment issues such as consumer credit andhousing, and the implications of government budget deficits.    These talks come at a particularly delicate time for theJapanese government, which is facing increasing domesticpressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy andstimulate the sagging economy by spending more.    Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention ofboosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.    Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the hugeU.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the tradeimbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Isbuying more imports.    Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a drafttrade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserialtrade practices. "It condemns Japan without due process," oneJapanese official said.    That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-outbill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.    Japan is also not totally happy with the administration'strade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocalaccess to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory tradeaction by the U.S., Officials said.    Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weakbargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade billoverhanging them.    "We have no leverage," one official admitted.    As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaintsabout its trade practices in a variety of fields, includingsuper computers.    The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanesesuper computer market.    The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire topublic institutions like universities which buy thesophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting upinformal bidding procedures easily understood by all potentialsellers, officials said.

TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS Taiwan plans another round of deep tariffcuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S.,A senior economic planner said.    Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economicplanning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would furtherreduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the secondhalf of this year.    Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year andWang said further cuts would go much deeper.    "We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffsfaster and more substantially," he said.    The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has saidthe island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high ofalmost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts astoo selective.     Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreignexchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said madeTaiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.    Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakenedTaiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas,particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which areamong the island's main export-earners.    A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washingtontomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last yearlimiting exports of Taiwan textiles.    Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth waslimited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it islosing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were givenmore generous terms.

TALKS SHOW NEW CANADIAN CONFIDENCE, GROUP SAYS Canada's decision to raise the issueof a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many seeas a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policystudy group said     "It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period,when it was a major player in the process of building a postwarworld," the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.    U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summeraimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries,the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipmentsof about 150 billion dlrs annually.    The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadlineof October for an agreement, are the biggest issue inU.S.-Canadian relations.   The study said liberalized trade between the two countrieswould improve the competitiveness of their economies in worldmarkets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.    The council said "in the past most Canadians have shied awayfrom the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to beoverwhelmed economically and politically by a closerassociation with a country 10 times their size in population."    But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized theirdomestic market was too small to permit the mass production andsales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by anincreasingly competitive world.    The council said that in the talks, Canada is chieflyinterested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports.    A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposedon Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were beingsubsidized.    The council said the chief U.S. concerns included endingcurbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, andthe so-called "cultural industries" - publishing, broadcastingand films.    It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defensecooperation, "acid rain" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadianassertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage. Reuter
JAPAN MOVES TO TIGHTEN CHIP-EXPORT CURBS The Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchipexports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve aU.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanesechipmakers doubt its usefulness.    A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers toissue certificates to specified trading houses stating they areauthorised exporters.    Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will berequired to show such a certificate, but those without it willnot automatically be denied licences, he said.    But some industry officials predicted any governmentmeasures were likely to have limited effect as long as theworld semiconductor market remained weak.    U.S. Government and industry officials have complainedrepeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at belowcost to third countries despite the July agreement.    Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow ofcheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales bythird-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap betweenlow prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costsand set for Japanese makers under the agreement.    The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey marketis increasing for one specific company, it suggests they aredistributing their products through their sales network knowingthey will be exported by some means. In that case we will askthem what they are doing to reduce the figure."    MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.    But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. "As longas there is a gap between prices set under the pact and marketprices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap tomake money," a Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T> spokesman said. REUTER

CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S. China called on the United States toremove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable tradingstatus and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 areinaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuadeCongress to change laws which limit its exports.     The official International Business newspaper todaypublished China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with thevisit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.     "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce itsrestrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilitiesfor them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chineseexports," the editorial said.     "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice againstfavourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit Chinainto the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).     "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports inrecent years, control of them is still extremely strict andinfluences normal trade between the two countries," it added     The paper also printed an article by China's commercialcounsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who saidthat "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventingbilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.     He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs ontechnology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.     The paper also printed a table showing that, sincebilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit everyyear except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficitsat 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.     A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not acceptPeking's trade figures at all, mainly because they excludegoods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. WhileU.S. Figures are based on country of origin.     He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it willhave to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend severallaws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.     The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs andTrade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not bedominated or controlled by international Communism."     The official said China was well aware of the laws, someof which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but thatthere is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To changethem.     China has been the subject of about a dozen casesinvolving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,which the U.S. Side won, he said.     But, for the first time, China signed last week anagreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrainexports of at least two categories of steel goods, which maylead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.     Another diplomat said willingness to provide suchvoluntary export restraints would be an important issue inbilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.     "China has the potential to disrupt world markets,especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervousabout China in this respect. But there is a precedent for othercentralled planned economies in GATT," the diplomat said.     Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members ofGATT but none has China's massive market potential for importsor its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.     In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomedChina's interest in participating in GATT.     "The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplishedovernight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a largeeconomy of the Chinese type," Shultz said.     "China can play an important role by actively joining GATTdiscussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities andenhance market access for exports worldwide. China can furtherdevelop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximumbenefit from its GATT participation," he said.     The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membershipare similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmenregard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especiallyfor exports, and a de facto dual currency system.     In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATTlast month, China said it was gradually reforming its economicsystem and replacing mandatory instruction with "guidanceplanning" and economic levers.     The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much todo. REUTER

BELGIAN SAYS EC WOULD REACT TO TEXTILE BILL Belgian Foreign Trade Minister HermanDe Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing worldtextile imports the only way the European Community (EC) couldreact was to retaliate.    De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textileimports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe."    And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.    Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it wasvetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports toprotect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliationU.S. trading partners.    A similar bill has been introducted this year, in aCongress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a Presidentweakened by the Iran scandal.    De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials andCongressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way wecould react would be retaliation, and it would cause moreretaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems."    He said if a textile bill was enacted, "we will impose taxeson a lot of American products."  He said "it would be stupid. Wehave to avoid that."    He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because ofits massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not withEC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted shipments of Asian textiles.    De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solveEC trade issues, saying "each time we come in contact, it aconflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West."    He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials crossthe Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.

ROSTENKOWSKI OPPOSES PROTECTIONIST TRADE BILL House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptationto pass a protectionist trade bill this year.    In remarks prepared for delivery before the National PressClub, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislationwill be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.    But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the tradebill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warnother countries their access to the American market would becurtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.    "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not asmoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,"Rostenkowski said.

U.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR Export Credits Guarantee Department hasnamed Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay'sBank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17years, to the post of executive director, a departmentspokesman said.    Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.    A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debtto the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recentyears.    Stephens said the fall in business volume was a topconvern, adding that the department may have to compete moreaggressively with private insurance firms providing similarservices.    The department's annual report for the year ended March 31,1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debtto the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.    Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But amonghis chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesserdeveloped countries and their ability to pay for their imports.    The agency will have to review its policies on insuringexport credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis,he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort ofthing we want to take a look at."    "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply ina peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,"Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD willstrike more countries from its list of political risk insurancerecipients.

ROSTENKOWSKI RELUCTANT TO BACK TAX HIKE House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to backthe tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.    He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be anumber of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan soughta tax increase to help balance the budget.    However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax ratesenacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.    There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.    Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general taxincreases.    On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect themajor trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industryfor special protection.    "To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,"he said.    This apparently ruled out congressional approval of anothertextile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as wasproposed again this year. Reuter

SPAIN TO LAUNCH EXPORT DRIVE Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta planthis month aimed at boosting exports to reach EuropeanCommunity levels, director-general of the INFE exportinstitute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.    "The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross DomesticProduct over the next four years compared to 15 pct now," hesaid.     "This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and thereis no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy,which have a similar productive structure," he said.    The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and otherfiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence ininternational trade fairs.    Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well astraditional industrial exports will be promoted.    Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while thegovernment's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special25 billion peseta grant.    The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct inreal terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.    Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand indeveloping countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.    He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went toOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)countries.    The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to theCommunity rose seven pct last year. The government plans toconcentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.    "The problem is convincing businessmen that exports arevital to survival in the context of EC competition," he said.    He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to thedomestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, whileturning their backs on foreign markets.    "They have to realise their share of the home market isgoing to shrink with growing deregulation," he said. "Foreigncompanies are taking up positions in the domestic economy andit is it vital to secure a market share abroad." REUTER

This was in the hope ofresolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.    The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protectthe U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,officially known as semiconductors.    The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules byallowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimumprices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.    The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gaveU.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.    Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the ECcomplaint during the heated Council debate.    Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador MichaelSamuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges wereunfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks. Reuter
GATT SETS UP DISPUTE PANEL ON CANADIAN HERRING The ruling GATT Council set up a formaldispute panel to examine a U.S. Complaint that a Canadian lawprohibiting export of unprocessed herring and salmon wasdiscriminatory.    David Wood, official spokesman of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing the decision wastaken after bilateral consultations failed to resolve the row.    U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels charged during the Councildebate that Canada was trying to preserve domestic jobs byinsisting that herring and salmon be processed at home.    Robert White, Canada's deputy chief of delegation, repliedthe law was in line with GATT rules, and was for conservationsreasons. But he agreed to setting up the dispute panel. Reuter
BRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM A senior British official said thatprotectionist bills being considered by Congress could triggerretaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten theglobal trading system.    Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said ifCongress passed legislation to curb textile imports, whichwould hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asiantextile producers, "the community would have to retaliate."    His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian TradeMinister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, thecommunity would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.    Channon made his remarks at a news conference after twodays of talks with Reagan Administration officials and membersof Congress.    De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.    Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment inCongress since his visit here last year as Congress and theAdministration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. tradedeficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.    Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation toforce Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.    Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyoneproblems - its surplus with the United States last year was51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.    "The more united pressure there could be, the better," hesaid.    Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation toavoid trade disputes.    He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontationearlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain andPortugal joined the community and its liberal importsregulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.    "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," hesaid, ""it does not mean that they would do so on anotheroccasion."    Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment inEurope over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressureof unilaterally imposed deadlines."    He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft andtaxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United Statesmust therefore learn to manage their relations better."    He said another bill to let the United States retaliateagainst a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement onTariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.    He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and notby the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to beinterpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what isto happen to the rest of us?"    reuter
YEUTTER PLANS TRADE TRIP TO CHINA THIS SUMMER U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss tradeissues including China's admission to the General Agreements onTariffs and Trade.    Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible Chinacould be a member of GATT before the end of the year.    "They are making major moves to becoming a full scale memberof the world economy," he told the House Appropriationssubcommittee which oversees his agency's budget.    Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms ofChina's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the finaltouches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip.    The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinationalgroup of nations which negotiates international rules on trade,would offer both potential export markets and potentialcompetition for U.S. industries, he said.    "That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S.business," Yeutter said.    "I think China will develop into a fine market for us," headded. Reuter
YEUTTER CONCERNED ABOUT U.S. EXPORT PICTURE U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said he expects imports to fall soon but he wasconcerned about the lack of improvement in U.S. exports giventhe dollar's decline in the last 18 months.    "I'm convinced we're about to see an improvement on theimport side. I'm more concerned about the export side," he tolda House Appropriations subcommittee.    Part of the blame goes on other countries which have notgenerated the economic growth to increase demand for U.S. goodsand part to some U.S. companies which are not generatingcompetitive exports, he said.

U.S. TELLS JAPAN TO DO MORE TO CUT TRADE SURPLUS U.S. Undersecretary of State for EconomicAffairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more toreduce its large trade surplus with the United States.    "Our central message to Japan this week was that while wehave made progress in some areas, much needs to be done," hetold a press conference after three days of talks.    "What we need is a resolution of trade issues, we needvisible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage moreimports and we need greater domestic-led growth."    Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year,Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduceits trade surplus, which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986.    He named several areas of particular concern to Washington-- computer microchips, supercomputers, Kansai airport,agricultural products and car telephones.    He warned that the U.S./Japan agreement governing trade insemiconductors was in jeopardy. Despite the pact, Japaneseproducers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets otherthan the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanesemarket has not increased, he said. REUTER
ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost itseconomy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washingtonto take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remainingrestrictions two weeks ago.    Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdownof the figure, saying it takes into account a number ofhypothetical losses. Some of them are "too sophisticated toconvert into financial terms," one banking source said.    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions isimpossible to calculate.    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland'seconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.    "Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they onlycontributed to largely internal, economic problems," one said.    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most FavouredNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliationfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union undermartial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy wasoriginally devised several years ago by the Institute ofNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planningcommission.    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polisheconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growthtrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases incredits from Western commercial and government lenders.    But the calculations were based on a time when trade wasbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissingthe estimate as "a theoretical projection based on a high point,which has no real scientific evaluation."    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports tothe U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrsannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions wereimposed.    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling tradesurplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrsagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland importantU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say creditsdried up for economic not political reasons.  "Poland isaccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate forpolitical reasons," said one expert. "It's an illusion based on amisunderstanding of Western economy."    "There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someonewho has no hope of repaying it," another said, adding thatPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy creditsin the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as "nebulous," onediplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical ordersand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing ofscientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say thelifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impacton Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrsand lacks the means to modernise its industry.    "MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will notbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult toregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces arein play now," said one Western envoy.    He said Polish products were not competitive, and theirquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionistmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamperPoland's efforts to regain entry.    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognisedthis fact recently.    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, "Makingup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonlydifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period oftwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level ofexports by only about 100 mln dlrs."    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says ithas a "moral right" to assistance from the U.S. Which it saysimposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoingof the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans willjust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushingSolidarity."    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, intalks in Washington last week with the International MonetaryFund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland waslooking for a lead from the United States.    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet itsfinancial obligations to the United States, "but not in a shorttime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of itsforeign economic partners."    He stressed that the U.S. "had a particular opportunity toplay a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partnersinterested in the settlement of Polish debt."    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamedWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF andParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years andsaid it should now play a more positive role.    "As a major superpower the United States can influenceinternational organisations," he said, citing recent meetingsaimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent towhich Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

CONSENSUS BUILDS FOR WORLD AGRICULTURAL REFORM Top U.S. and European farm trade andgovernment representatives called for a sweeping reform ofworld agriculture to redress a critical demand and supplyimbalance.    Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets heredemonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need foran urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade andproduction.    "It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom andharmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) thedisruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls ofprotection climb higher and the level of possible retaliationbecome more harmful," U.S. Department of Agriculture DeputyAdministrator William Bailey said.    Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, whichends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need toadjust its policies to the changing market environment.    The need for urgent reforms is justified by the "imbalanceand tensions of the world economy," the secretary general of theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and DevelopmentJean-Claude Paye said.    And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, he noted.    Paye stressed the need for a progressive and jointreduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measuresto help farmers in unprofitable areas.    Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farmprices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, andinstead help farmers through income support and adjustmentaids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president ofCargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses.    Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must takegreater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.    However, "differentiated policy treatment is required" totake account of large disparities in the situation around theEC, he said.    "Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economyand will remain so if the right policy is pursued within theCommunity," he said. Reuter

BAKER SAYS G-6 PACT JUST A START Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe agreement among industrial nations in Paris last month isonly a start in Washington's drive to intensify economiccooperation among leading countries.    In a speech to the National Newspaper Association, Bakersaid "the six steps beginning with the Plaza Agreement andculminating in the Paris Accord, are only a start."    He added "we see our role as a steward of a process in whichwe sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promotemore balanced international growth."    The Paris agreements called trade surplus countries tostrengthen their growth and on the U.S. to reduce its budgetdeficit. Under such circumstances, the countries agreed theircurrencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economicfundamentals.    Baker also said he still sees "ominous" signs of pressure forprotectionist trade legislation "and this pressure forprotectionism is coming from new areas of society."

STUDY SAYS U.S., CANADA PACT WOULD SPUR ECONOMIES A free trade pact between the UnitedStates and Canada could spur the economies of both sidessubstantially, according to a study released by the Institutefor International Economics.    The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusionto the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada'sgross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S.export's by about seven pct.    He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue ofgovernment subsidies, end curbs on trade in services andinvestments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    The United States and Canada - the world's two biggesttrading partners with cross border shipments of about 150billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. Theyare aiming for a pact by next October.    Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity ofMaryland, said an agreement should include:    - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phasedin over a five to 10-year period;    - Equal access to federal government procurement in the twocountries, replacing current "Buy America" and "Buy Canada"provisions with a "Buy North America" provision;    - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly financeand transportation;    - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favordomestic producers;    - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.     Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, thetwo sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.    The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.    He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offsetsubsidies should go first a special disputes commission forresolution at an early stage.    Wonnacott said "bilateral free trade would contribute to theefficiency of the North American economies and to theircompetitiveness in facing overseas producers.    He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadiangoods and enable them to benefit from the economies of massproduction.    Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those toCanada proportionately, he said, because of the already largeU.S. gross national product.    Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areasas export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commissioncould set an example for the current attempt by GATT to writenew and more liberal global trading regulations.

SOVIET ECONOMIST SEES FEW 1987 GAINS IN U.S. TRADE There is little chance Soviet exportsto the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscow's currenttrade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goodsin future, a Soviet economist said.    Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, anagent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told aU.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few itemsthat western nations want.    But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods andallowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encouragemodest export gains in future.    Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth ofgoods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billiondlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.    But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, totaltrade between the two countries would remain between two andthree billion dlrs a year.

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS Japanese microchip makers are beingstrong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact onsemiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan'smarket to foreign chips, industry analysts said.    But doubts remain over whether the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuringthe firms, can successfully battle market forces and whetherthe U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of anybreathing space, they said.    U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last Septemberhave pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanesechipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.    "MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industryto get things done," said Bache Securities (Japan) associatevice president Peter Wolffe.    Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for theJanuary to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensivechips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subjectto the pact's price controls.    The ministry also asked electronics firms to providedistributors with certificates designating them as authorisedexporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which greymarketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.    U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was injeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American marketsand little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.    But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to theproduction cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corpsaid it would cut production in line with MITI's request.    "NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI'sdemands," said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. "OnceNEC cuts production, it means they all have."    Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanesefirms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales thatthe Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.    "The best way to lower cost is to produce more," said SalomonBrothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.    Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could alsospur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst MattAizawa said.    Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any newrestrictions, some industry officials said.    "It's like tax avoidance schemes," said Steve Donovan, headof MMI Japan K.K. "As soon as you close one route, anotheropens."    MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earliershrugged off MITI guidance.    "It's getting to be like communism," said one.    But analysts said output cuts could help by making iteasier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcingfirms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.    "They're going to have to start running their businesseslike businesses," Bache's Wolffe said.    MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaignurging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industryofficials said response has been mixed at best.    "There has been some change, but it's not across the board,"said one U.S. Spokesman. "The companies have a varying degree ofurgency."    The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on thetroubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.    Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamicrandom access memory) chips could merely speed the transitionto one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.    Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memorychips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, theysaid.    Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing themost advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.    Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.    "The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn'teven have an office here," a source close to the industry said."You could question just how committed they are."    In addition, some industry analysts question theeffectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out thirdcountry chipmakers such as those in South Korea.    "(South) Korea's gaining market share," said one analyst."They're the real winners from the agreement." REUTER

But he added "the leaders seem hesitant to make concessionsbecause of domestic political reasons."    Speaking of his own country, he said "We have made a lot ofconcessions already."    He cited regulations permitting foreign investment inindustrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activityand cracking down on piracy of intellectual property bystrengthening protection of copyrights and patents.

Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods ifCongress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said "at thismoment, we have no thought of retaliation."    South Korea is a major exporter to the United States oftextiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as televisionsets, video cassette records and personal computers.    Its puchases from the United States include electronictesting equipment and grains and cotton.

U.S. HOUSE PANEL TAKES FIRST TRADE BILL VOTES House trade lawmakers took theirfirst votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws butheld over until tomorrow the most difficult votes oncontroversial plans to protect American industries.    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means TradeSubcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issuesin the bill--whether they will force major foreign tradingpartners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the UnitedStates.    The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version ofDemocratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to openforeign markets but which drops last year's effort to forcePresident Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs.    Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said thelawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and willconsider a proposal to mandate retaliation without settingspecific trade penalties.    The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways andMeans Committee next week before the full House votes on it.    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seekinghis party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer anamendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses ofthose countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods.    This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan toforce a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surpluswith the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, WestGermany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.    "My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard forgetting the trade deficit down," he told reporters.    The trade law changes are to become part of a majorcongressional and administration effort to turn around therecord U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year byopening up foreign markets and making U.S. products morecompetitive.    House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said againtoday he expects the full House will approve the trade bill byMay and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.    "I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and MeansCommittee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effectivebill," he told reporters.    The comprehensive trade bill will include work by othercommittees to ease export controls on high technology, to aidU.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulateresearch and development, to remove foreign trade barriers andto improve education and worker training.    The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S.industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competitionif they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining,safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to thecountry's economic development.    They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether toretaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules andwhether an injured industry deserves import relief.    They agreed to make it easier for a company to gettemporary relief from import competition but agreed theindustry should provide a plan to become competitive.    The administration has not announced its support butYeutter said yesterday, "I am cautiously optimistic," that theDemocratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill. Reuter
SOVIET MINISTER SAYS TRADE BOOST UP TO FRENCH Soviet first deputy prime ministerVsevolod Murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here hiscountry wanted to boost joint business with France, but that areduction of France's trade deficit with the Soviet Uniondepended on the French.    Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the StateAgro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conferencehe had discussed a variety of possible deals with Frenchcompanies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec.    Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said hehad discussed plant protection and the processing of highlysulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology foragricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetablejuice processing with Imec.    An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent onpackaging could be signed soon, but could not give any otherdetails. The other two companies were not immediately availablefor comment.    Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France'strade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 monthsof 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovskytold Reuters: "It all depends on France."    At a meeting in Paris last January French and Sovietforeign trade ministers said they were committed to increasedefforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed aFrench 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986.    Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk withanybody with "interesting" proposals offering latest technologyand assuring "a mutual advantage."    He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it andwould deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting.    He encouraged companies to take advantage of new lawsguaranteeing "the interests of foreign partners" in jointventures.    But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under thenew joint venture laws.    He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as aresult of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow lastmonth with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng.    He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposalsfor further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last monthsaid the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth ofgoods.    Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, anddesigned primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union'sfood production capacity. Reuter
BRITAIN CALLS ON JAPAN TO INCREASE IMPORTS Britain today called on Japan toincrease foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism andthe harm it would bring to it and other trading nations.    British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon saidJapan must heed a report issued by a Japanese governmentadvisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand tohelp cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy.    "I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems toJapan's domestic economy," he told a group of Japanesebusinessmen in London.    "But these short term difficulties should not be allowed todeflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary," he said.    "It is not just a domestic issue for Japan. If importpropensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk fromprotectionist lobbies, particularly in the U.S. With whom Japanhas so massive a surplus," he said.    "They may well succeed in securing action by governmentswhich would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japanand the U.K."    Channon said there had been substantial growth in thevolume of trade between Japan and Britain, amounting to 6.2billion sterling (9.8 billion dlrs) last year.    But he added: "Regrettably too much of it was in onedirection, with the Japanese selling us 3.7 billion sterling(5.8 billion dlrs) more than we sold them." Reuter
TAIWAN FURTHER RELAXES FOREIGN GOODS IMPORT CURBS Taiwan said it would soon relax importcontrols on some 400 foreign items, including stationery andbooks, in a further effort to allow trading partners,especially the U.S., Greater access to its markets.

CANADA LEADERS FAIL TO SET PACT ON FREE TRADE Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said heheld "frank" discussions with the Canadian province premiers onthe pace of free trade talks with the United States, but thelongstanding issue of provincial ratification remains to besettled.    Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetingswith the 10 premiers, Mulroney said further discussions wouldbe held in June and September to discuss the role of theprovinces in approving any new trade deal.    But he maintained progress was being made in the sweepingtalks with the Unites States that got under nearly two yearsago.    "It appears reasonable progress is being made (in thetalks)," Mulroney said.    Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed, "Things are running prettyquickly now."    The talks, launched by Mulroney's Progressive Conservativegovernment after concerns about protectionist sentiment in theU.S., are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between theworld's largest trading partnership.    But the provinces are expected to play a major role in anynew trading arrangement, and some of the provincial leaderscomplained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratificationformula.    "It's my view that we should be thinking about these thingsright now, along with the questions of the substance of theagreement," commented Ontario Premier David Peterson, who hasbeen highly critical of the talks in the past.    But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreementwas more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be noneed for a "hard and fast formula."    Peckford said it appears Canada is prepared to makeconcessions to the United States on financial services in orderto make inroads on other bargaining areas, such as agriculture.    Canadian published reports, quoting government sources, saythe two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and itwill involve eliminating border tariffs and many non-tariffbarriers over the next 10 to 12 years.    A rough draft of the accord is expected to be presented tothe premiers at the June meeting while the finished document ishoped to be presented to Congress in October.

SWISS FEB TRADE DEFICIT 629.7 MLN FRANCS (JAN DEFICIT 209.4 MLN) -  Australian beef output is forecast todecline to 1.34 mln tonnes carcass weight in 1987 and 1.36 mlnin 1988 from 1.44 mln in 1986, the Australian Meat andLive-Stock Corp (AMLC) said.    Exports of beef/veal are also predicted to decline to480,000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515,000 in 1986, andthen rally to 490,000 in 1988, the AMLC said in a summary ofits bi-annual meat and livestock forecasts.    It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 levelof 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding isexpected to be slower than previously forecast.    Beef producers are becoming more confident that higherreturns in the market, both domestically and overseas, willcontinue, the AMLC said.    The slow herd build-up and the forecast lower production isexpected to bring about a slight drop in both export anddomestic consumption this year, it said.    The forecast does not assume a turnaround in productionlevels until late next year.    It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion ofoutput remains much the same as last year when it was around 55pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct.    The increase in exports of beef as a percentage ofproduction has mainly been attributed to the decline in theAustralian dollar, the AMLC said.    It also forecast that Australia's four major markets, theU.S., Japan, Canada and Taiwan, will continue to dominate thechilled and frozen beef export markets. They take collectivelyaround 94 pct of total Australian exports. REUTER

TRADE BILL TO CHANGE AGRICULTURE TRADE LAWS The House Ways and Means Committeeis moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said wasintended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agriculturalgoods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.    The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan totake into account the potential harm to U.S. agriculturalexports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreignunfair trade practices against other domestic industries.    The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seekgovernment monitoring of imports if there is a reasonablechance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.    The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the billnext week and congressional sources said they expect it will beapproved.     In investigations involving a processed agriculturalproduct, trade associations of processors or producers wouldhave to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfairduties.     The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives forthe Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture,seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import andexport practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas andnon-tariff barriers.     President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATTagreement would be extended through January 1993 and authorityto negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extendedthrough January 3, 1991.    The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate aninternational coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.    It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugarimported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for productionof sugar or products containing sugar and destined forre-export. The export of the sugar or products must occurbefore Octoer 1, 1991.

One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters adraft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct futureinterest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 yearrepayment term.    Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday.    Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow onTuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador toMoscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue.    One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange ratefor trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on arate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollarwhich Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating officialrate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.    The officials said part of the debt would be paid inexports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture.    Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open thedoor for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-builtsteel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-yeardevelopment plan ending June 30 1992.    Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprintand glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases ofcurrently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet militaryhardware, the officials said.    An estimated 65 pct of Egypt's arsenal is still made up ofSoviet-supplied equipment, one official said.

BALDRIGE WARNS OF WORLD TRADE WAR DANGER U.S. Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade billthis year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompta trade war.    "The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade asI've ever seen it in six years in Washington," Baldrige said ina weekend television interview.    "I think we'll still be able to get a reasonable trade billout in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying towork together with the administration, but there is a hardeningtrade attitude," he said.    President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation butagreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent thatopposition Democrats would pass such legislation.    However, Baldrige warned measures that would penalizetrading partners such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan forfailing to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. could leadto retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto anysuch bill.    When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide tradewar, Baldrige said: "Yes, I don't think there's any questionabout that." Reuter
WEST GERMAN EXPORTS TO U.S. DROP SHARPLY West German exports to the UnitedStates fell below four billion marks worth in January for thefirst time since mid-1984, provisional Bundesbank data showed.    The figures showed exports were 3.85 billion marks inJanuary, sharply down from December's 4.40 billion and thelowest since the 3.56 billion exported to the U.S. In July1984. This compared with 4.86 billion marks in January 1986.    Total West German exports to Western industrialisedcountries also fell in January to 34.76 billion marks fromDecember's 36.45 billion, also posting the lowest monthly totalsince July 1984.    West German exports to the European Community were 21.60billion marks in January, down from 22.14 billion in Decemberand 22.94 billion in January last year, the figures showed.    Exports to developing nations and centrally-plannedeconomies also slackened.    Separately, Commerzbank AG said in a report that the focusof West German exports this year was likely to shift to Europebecause of an expected downturn in growth in the dollar area.    This was one of the strengths of West German exportscompared with Japan, which depended in large part on the U.S.,OPEC and developing country markets, it added. REUTER

CANADA'S MULRONEY SAYS U.S. TRADE DEAL NEARS Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said"significant progress" was being made in trade talks with theUnited States and a profile of a major deal was emerging.    Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons,Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs inCanada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries.    Mulroney, who offered few new details of the talks, saidthat while the negotiations were risky and difficult, "aprofile of a major trade deal is now emerging."  In a 50-minute address, Mulroney made an often passionatedefense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areasof the country a major economic boost.    "Because of our trading patterns over a period of decades,we are in the process of building two Canadas -- one that isrich and promising, one that is under-developed andunder-employed," said Mulroney.    "What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and BritishColumbians and Albertans and others, that they get theirchance. They must be given the opportunity to trade their wayto prosperity."    Few detials have been released on the trade talks whichwere launched nearly two years ago between the two nations thatare each others most important trading partners.    Recent published reports in Canada, quoting senior tradesources, said the countries were close to reaching a trade dealand it will involve eliminating border trariffs and manynon-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.    It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks isa Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes,something that would give Canada protection from Washington'stough trade remedy laws.    But Mulroney, sharply critical of protectionist sentimentin the U.S, said Canada was a "fair trader" and denied thegovernment was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to theAmerican market.    He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides.    "We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal, one that isfair to both sides," Mulroney said. Reuter

TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN U.S. HOUSE U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for ashowdown between protectionists and free traders as a majortrade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by thefull House of Representatives in late April.    In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a keyHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version oflegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices.    The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional effortsto restore competitiveness of American industries and turnaround last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.    Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcementof trade laws.    The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly oncomplaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping productsin the United States at prices below cost of production. Italso forces the administration to act rapidly when an industrycomplains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls fortrade relief for specific industries such as textiles.    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made toomany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to backamendments to "get tough" with countries that violate tradeagreements or keep out U.S. products.    But congressmen known for their allegiance to free tradesaid the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputesand they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.    Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was notone "that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,"but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to worktoward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.    The goal of trade legislation was "to make our trade policystronger without violating our international trade agreements,"he said.    In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and MeansCommittee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the tradesubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forcedReagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on importsfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices.    It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation ifit would hurt the U.S. economy.    Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach wasnecessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would signinto law.    Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a toughHouse trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year heonly reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he sawDemocratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters latelast week that the administration still did not like some ofthe bill's provisions, but he added, "Generally we feel verygood about the bipartisan consideration of the tradelegislation. I think we are progressing very well."    The first battle will take place next week when the fullHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, SouthKorea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S.    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide onlythat the existence of a large trade surplus with the UnitedStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,but would not automatically set off retaliation.    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief fromimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.    AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered theadministration when he said any trade bill Reagan would signwould not be worth passage in Congress.    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate bysaying, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please LaneKirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signedby the president."    Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a billto protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aidesaid. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.    House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the mostinfluential proponents of aid for specific industries beset bylow-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call forimport relief for the domestic oil industry and announced hissupport for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil importtariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.

BRAZIL TRADE SURPLUS RISES IN FEBRUARY The trade surplus doubled infebruary to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln, but was  belowthe 628 mln of February 1986, official figures show.

Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mlnin February 1986 because of lower prices, he added.    Fendt said that although the February results were lowerthan the average expected for the rest of the year, thegovernment's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of9.5 billion dlrs.    Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrsand imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.    Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billiondlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line withgovernment plans to foster economic growth.    Fendt said that imports were running at levels well abovethe traditional average for Brazil.    In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oiland wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion inthe same 1986 period.    This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilianindustry to equip to raise production and is perfectlycompatible with the government's program for economic growth,Fendt added. Reuter

BRITISH FARM MINISTER ATTACKS SUBSIDIES Farm subsidies and protectionistmoves threaten healthy trade on both sides of the Atlantic,Michael Jopling, British minister of Agriculture, Fisheries andFood, warned.    "It would not be sensible to provoke another dispute betweenEurope and the United States," Jopling said in remarks preparedfor an evening speech.    "But some things are clear and they apply on both sides ofthe Atlantic. We cannot continue to pile up stocks while worlddemand shrinks," he said.    "Governments must not operate farm policies as if they werepurely domestic affairs with no impact on others. They alsohave to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop ahealthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionismand excessive subisdies.    "And above all, Europe and the United States have too manycommon interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade warsand competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting noone." He added, "It is crucial that the United States and theEuropean Community remain friends."    Jopling, who is a member of the EC agriculture committee,was in Indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with U.S.officials in Washington later this week.    Jopling also criticized a recent proposal still underconsideration by the EC for a tax on vegetable and fish oils.    He said his government would oppose such a move because "Wedo not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to support(EC) farmers should be alleviated by raising money at theconsumer's expense."

EC External Trade Commissioner, Willy De Clercq has alreadywritten to his U.S. counterpart, special U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter, outlining the EC's concerns.    The ministers' said they were "very disturbed" by the U.S.moves, adding, "the adoption of such measures would not fail tohave a negative effect on the process of multilateralnegotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations."    Any unilateral U.S. moves would leave the EC no option butto react according to the laws of the world trade body, theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they said.    In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers saidthey "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance intrade ... (and) expect Japan to open up its market more."    The statement added that the EC continued to insist thatthe Japanese government must boost imports and stimulatedemand.    Ministers also called on the European Commission to preparea report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enablethem to take action where necessary.

S.KOREA SAYS JAPAN COMPLAINS TO GATT ON TRADE PLAN Japan has complained to the secretariatof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that SouthKorea's five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japanbreaks GATT rules, Trade Ministry officials here said.    They said Japan submitted a report earlier this monthalleging South Korea's plan to import less from Japan and morefrom the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creatingnon-tariff trade barriers.    South Korea unveiled the plan in November. It said it hopedto narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by1991.    South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45billion dlrs in 1986, and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first twomonths of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period.    The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not toimport Japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to Japan.    The officials said they believed the Japanese action, onestep short of filing a suit, was designed to bring South Koreato the negotiating table and stop the plan.    The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various importrestrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Koreangoods to help reduce the trade deficit. REUTER
JAPAN SAYS U.S.-JAPAN MICROCHIP PACT WORKING Japanese officials sought to convince theU.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working aheadof an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove theircase.    "We are implementing the agreement in good faith and thesituation does not run counter to the pact," Osamu Watanabe,Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's(MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division, told foreign reporters.    "The effects of the measures we have taken and are takingare emerging in the market place," he said.    U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanesemicrochip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell atbelow cost in markets outside Japan and the United States.    The agreement, signed last September, aimed at haltingpredatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S.Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market.    The comments by MITI officials followed a call by PrimeMinsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings onthe U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said.    Yukio Honda, director of MITI's Industrial ElectronicsDivision, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at belowcost in third countries.    MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cutproduction of key memory chips in the first quarter of thisyear has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale inthe non-regulated grey market, Honda said.    "The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, butin contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expandingmarket share because of their cheaper prices," Honda said.    MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excesssupply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after thepact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductorexports to the United States, he added.    The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelinesfor the second quarter and suggested production volumes arelikely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said.    Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around anyartificial controls, regulation of supply and demand shouldbring positive results, Watanabe said. "I am optimistic," headded. REUTER

DUTCH OFFICIAL WARNS OF MORE TRADE CONFLICTS Already strained relations betweenthe U.S. And the European Community (EC) are likely to getworse before they get better, director general of the DutchEconomics Ministry's foreign affairs division Frans Engeringsaid.    Speaking at an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in TheHague, Engering noted the developing history of crises oversteel, citrus and pasta, and warned of more to come.    "I consider the strident tone of US declarations on Airbusill-advised, and the EC fats and oils tax proposal a dangerousprovocation," he said. "I feel that we shall probably have todeal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future."    Not only is the US Congress clearly very determined to getthe American balance of payments into better shape, but therisks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the EC hasits own constraints in meeting outside pressure, Engeringnoted.    "If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable thatwe keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war,then I think the answer is probably yes," he said.    In order to reduce these tensions, decision-making in theEC must become less self-centred, and the US Administrationwill have to exercise the authority to convince Congress andpressure groups of the need for accommodation, he added.

U.S. TREASURY ANNOUNCES OECD TIED-AID PACT U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakersaid an agreement has been reached by members of theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) tocontrol the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promotetrade.    He said in a statement the agreement culminates the Reaganadministration's effot to negotiate a virtual end to exportcredit subsidies.    The practice of other governments using tied aid or mixedcredits to promote exports has cost the United States lost jobsand lost exports, the Treasury said.    The agreement to be implemented in two stages by July, 1988would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries andplace limits on permitted aid by developing countries.    It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aidand reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poorcountries, the Treasury said.

OECD AGREES EXPORT CREDIT REFORMS The western industrialised nations haveagreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit forexports to developing countries, the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development said.    The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid tosubsidise export credits in so-called "mixed credits," the OECDsaid.    The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July thisyear and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixedcredits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct forcredits covering exports to the world's least developednations.    Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculatingthe aid element in mixed credits, to take account of differentinterest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,which hosted the reform negotiations, said.    Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised tradeloans have also been revised with the aim of cutting thesubsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relativelyrich developing countries by July next year.    The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. Tostop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aidto subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.    OECD officials said the agreement was based on aprovisional accord reached in January subject to ratificationby member governments. Some governments, including Austria, hadlinked their final approval to other trade credit issues whichwould be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.    By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixedcredits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies toocostly for frequent use.    "A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade has been closed today," a senior U.S. Official herecommented. REUTER
EC WARNS CONGRESS ON NEW TRADE BILL The European Community (EC) haswarned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough tradelegislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S.trading partners.    The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, headof the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski,chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.    A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters.    Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backedaspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under theGATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.    But Denman disagreed with other provisions which wouldrequire President Reagan to take retaliatory trade actionagainst nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. andwould set new standards for judging unfair foreign tradepractices.    Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibitmember nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action intrade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.    He said "If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory,then the United States would be in violation of itsinternational legal obligations and on a collision course withits major trading partners."    Denman added that a president should have flexibility inenforcing trade laws, saying "in the last resort, anyadministration must take its decision in light of the overallnational interest."    Otherwise, he said, "the risk would be counter-reaction bytrading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation orenactment of mirror image legislation to be employed againstimports from the United States."    Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if itreduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier forfirms to file unfair trade practice claims.    Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standardsfor findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.    "Changes in these standards must be agreed uponmultilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United Statesalone on the world trading system," he said.    House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-statelegislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curbimports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed twoyears ago but vetoed by President Reagan.    There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto theentire trade bill because of the textile amendment.    Reuter

Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to bedamaging to U.S. economic or national security interests.    "We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart ofour national security," subcommittee chairman James Florio, aNew Jersey Democrat said.    The subcommittee also called for the administration toconsider retaliation against Japan for its restrictivegovernment procurement practices.    The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement thatthe administration investigate whether U.S. companies weretreated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids onlucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlrKansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained theywere not allowed to bid on its construction.    At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, thesubcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japaneseproduct--digital audio recorders.    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and MeansCommittee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S.telecommunications products.     Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S.companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports ofcounterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright andpatent laws.

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan andKorea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic andcurrency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries,economists said.    "The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will bescreaming at those countries about their exports," said SteveCerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.    Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.    Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoricagainst Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow theircurrencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.    The thrust has shifted to those newly industrializedcountries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against thecurrencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the mainfocus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning toclose the competiveness gap for American goods.    U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that heexpects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year.    But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on theirown doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have notrisen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiariesof soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese andKorean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.    "In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington wasJapan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing," said Robert Chandross, ofLloyds Bank PLC.    Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singaporeand Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.    The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral tradedeficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.    And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend iscontinuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. Thegap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.    Lately both nations have said they will take steps todefuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing manyof the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut importtariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.    Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said lastweek that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three tofive years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.    For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cuttariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 andtry to diversify exports. But vice economic minister WangChien-Shien said last month that he still does not expectTaiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.    The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textilesand electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in thearea of "big-ticket" manufactured goods, notably cars.    Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America-- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.    "The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. Whentheir exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturingbase. It cuts directly to us and to our customers," said BobWendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.    The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports,72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of itstelecommunications equipment.    A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan andSouth Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.    While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with theU.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.    But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand inmarked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly intolarge bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall tradeand current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.    Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, andKorea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.    Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.    "A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have beenat Japan's expense," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.    February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powersexorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.    But this two-pronged approach has drawn little responsefrom the two nations so far and, in any case, will only workwith a sizeable lag, economists say.    The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's andKorea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which ispegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct sinceSeptember 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.    But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat againstthe U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.    "We've not seen any lessening of competition from thosecountries that we can attribute to currency changes," saidBethlehem Steel's Wendt.    And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use theirhefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.    Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism willget given the administration's free-trade stance. "It's hard tosee that anything will be passed much before year-end. And thenthe question is, will it have teeth?" one economist said.    Reuter
EC OFFICIAL FAULTS U.S. TRADE BILL Sir Roy Denman, Head of the ECDelegation in Washington, said pending U.S. trade legislationis a misguided attempt to deal with the nation's trade deficitand will spark retaliation if passed in its present form.    "To think that you can deal with a trade deficit bylegislation is a mistake," he told the Foreign TradeAssociation here.    Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which hewarned of in a letter to House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on aproduct-for-product basis.    "Retaliation does not have to be matched product toproduct," Denman said.    He said in the case of textiles import restrictions,however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.    "Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on Europeanexports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likelyto retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports toEurope," Denman said.    He also took exception to U.S. proposals to requirecountries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. tocut those surpluses or face special tariffs.    "This would conflict with international obligations, throwa large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations andcould easily boomerang," he warned of the tariff proposals.    Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seekreciprocity in specific trade sectors.    "Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barrierswould simply lead to retaliation from the other party," hesaid, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved bytrading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages inanother.

JAPAN SAYS OECD STUDY ON SUBSIDIES STILL ONGOING Japanese Agriculture Ministry officialssaid a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development, OECD, is still under wayand will be completed sometime next month.    The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far,and they said Japan would comment on the final results.    A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the studyhas found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies inthe world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any othercommodity producers from subsidies. The study has not beenofficially released due to objections from some countries.    Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept therelease of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said.OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meetingin mid-May.    One agriculture ministry source said the study so far wasbased on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have droppedsharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy,and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said.    "The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it doesnot take account of various differences in farming conditionsin each country, such as geography," the source said.    He said it is highly likely that the final study will showJapan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.    "This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farmmarket further, but this would have little impact on Japan'sagriculture policy," he said, without giving further details.    A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidiesby major exporting nations like the United States and theEuropean Community, but Japan is a major importer, he said. Reuter
EC AND COMECON ENDS TALKS WITH PROGRESS The European Community (EC) andSoviet-led Comecon ended talks here, having made progress onsetting up formal trade relations, but no breakthrough becauseof Comecon's refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of theEC, delegates said.    Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft ofa joint declaration setting up official relations after 30years of mutual non-recognition. John Maslen, head of the ECdelegation, told Reuters as he emerged from the final session:"We made some progress, but we have called for another meeting."    Officials, who asked not to be named, said the Comecon teamhad refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration whichwould recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC.    Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreementssigned by the Community must contain this territorial clausestipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An ECnegotiator taking part in the three-day talks said: "We wantedthe territorial clause in, but Comecon said no."    A joint statement issued after the talks said progress wasmade towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would benecessary to complete the work.    Any decision in principle to set up relations would requireapproval by the Community's Council of Ministers and by theexecutive committee of Comecon.    Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads theEast bloc delegation, told Reuters ahead of today's session: "Wehave narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but noton all questions."    Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that anyjoint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of theCommunity, he replied: "This question is not contained in thedraft which our side presented."    West German diplomats said they would insist on includingthe clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement.    The talks followed an earlier round between the two tradingblocs here last September and the first-ever direct talksbetween the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomaticrelations in January.    The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despitenon-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a fivebillion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about halfthe deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price ofSoviet oil imported by the EC. REUTER
 EC SAYS U.S. BROKE TRADE RULES IN AKZO-DUPONT ROW The European Community Commission hascharged the United States with breaking international traderules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market andsaid it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT.    In the latest of a series of trade disputes withWashington, the executive authority alleged that a section ofthe U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminatedagainst imported products in favour of domestically-producedgoods.    The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to ruleon whether the section in question, which officials said hadproved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules.    Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measuresif, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed tobring the disputed section into line with international rules.    The executive's decision to go to GATT follows a complaintto it by the Dutch company Akzo <AKZO.AS>, whose "aramid"synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market becauseof charges by the U.S. Firm <Dupont> that the fibres violatethe American company's patents.    Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S.International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory andincompatible with GATT provisions.    The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of theU.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over importedproducts. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did nothave the same possibilities for defending themselves before theITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.    "Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourablethan that which takes places in normal courts of law for goodsproduced in the United States," it said in a statement. Reuter
GATT TO DEBATE U.S. CHARGES OF AIRBUS SUBSIDIES The U.S. Will pursue its complaint thatEuropean governments unfairly subsidise the Airbus Industrieaircraft consortium in proceedings at the GATT civil aircraftcommittee, a GATT spokesman said today.    The U.S. Presented its case for the first time to theaircraft committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) during a special two-day session ending today.GATT rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce.    The 20-member committee agreed to open debate on the U.S.Complaint, starting with informal consultations and thenholding a special session in July, trade officials said.    "The tension has eased," the permanent trade ambassador ofthe 12-member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters."The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels."    U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over whatthey call unfair government support for Airbus, voiced during avisit to European capitals in February.    In a letter calling for the special committee meeting,Washington charged France, West Germany, the U.K., Spain andthe EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus.    The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating ruleslaid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.    Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement topurchase aircraft and support for development of airlinesduring the special session and asked the committee to confirmits view.    Official sources in the delegations said the U.S. Viewswould be considered during the informal consultations but theEuropeans would also be free to bring up any complaints againstAmerican civil aircraft practices.    Some delegates said the U.S. Position appeared to give suchbroad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civilaircraft accord needed re-negotiating. All these matters wouldbe considered during the informal meetings. Reuter
JAPAN OPENS HOME MARKET TO U.S. FISH Japan has agreed to drop barriers toAmerican-caught herring and pollock, opening the way forshipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually, U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter announced.    Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensivebilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo.    He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments ofprocessed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mlndlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in lateryears.    There was no immediate assessment of the value of currentU.S. shipments, but officials said the pact would lift quotasto the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly allthe pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms.    At the same time, Yeutter said Washington was temporarilysuspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of thetwo fish.

CANADA'S CLARK SEES TRADE AS MOST URGENT PROBLEM Trade is the most urgent problemfacing U.S.-Canadian relations because of a pressing need toreach a new bilateral pact within the coming months, Joe Clark,Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, said.    Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting formore than a year in an effort to work out an agreement.    "The most urgent problem now is the trade question becausethat has to be decided within the next 10 months," Clark toldthe Commonwealth Club of California. "We have a fast trackauthority from your Congress for approval or rejection ofwhatever the negotiators achieve."    Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initialagreement must be reached by late September or early October.    He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain,and defense as the second and third most important bilateralissues facing Ottawa and Washington.    On Wednesday, President Reagan announced that he will seek2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rainproblem. Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture inadvance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, withPrime Minister Brian Mulroney.    In a question-and-answer session with the public affairsgroup, Clark said that the two countries must find bettermechanisms for resolving their trade disputes.    "This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted oncorn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they werequasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in placenow are not working adequately in either of our interests," hesaid.    Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington's ruleson government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, hesaid.    "There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order tosecure substantial contracts in the United States, have had tomove their head offices out of our country into your countrybecause you have national procurement requirements," he said.    In turn, he added, the United States would like to changesome of the procurement requirements that exist at theprovincial government level in Canada.    Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.    "What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, inthe first instance, to propose, and then governments andcongresses will have judge," he said.    In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United Stateshas tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports toits northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan."Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last yearthan you bought from Canada," he said.

U.S. SENATORS SAY SANCTIONS LIKELY ON MICROCHIPS The United States will likely imposesanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators saidtoday after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige.    Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decisionwould be taken until a final determination is made on whetherJapanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they saidthey were virtually sure Japan would face penalties.    President Reagan's trade policy advisory group, of whichBaldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday.    "I am confident we will see action taken," Sen. John McCain,an Arizona Republican, told reporters.    "I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more thansanctions," Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said.    The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductorindustry representatives met with Baldrige and State Departmentofficials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the UnitedStates and other countries.    They recommended Japanese firms be penalized throughtariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months forcontinuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said.    Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen.Pete Wilson told reporters, "The clear import of what he said isthat there will be."    "Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctionsmust be applied," for past violations of the agreement, theCalifornia Republican said.    The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chipswhich are used in high technology products ranging from radiosto defence missile guidance systems.    Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige toldthem the administration had not made a final determination thatJapanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips belowthe cost of production in the United States or other countries.    But McClure said senators told him, "There is no doubtdumping is going on," based on evidence such as invoices ofpurchases of the Japanese products.    The two countries signed a pact last September in whichJapan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the UnitedStates and other countries below production costs and to allowthe U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market.    In return, the United States waived its right to imposeimport duties on the Japanese microchips.    Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pactand have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output tosave the pact.    Japan has frequently been the target of congressionaldiscouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr tradedeficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the UnitedStates last year and had large surpluses with other countries.    The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolutioncalling for action against Japan for violations of the pactsince September. The resolution will be introduced in the Housenext week by Rep. Bob Matsui, a California Democrat. Reuter
NEXT WORLD TRADE NEGOTIATIONS MUST SUCCEED - NZ Ministers from more than 20nations were told by New Zealand that the next internationalnegotiations on liberalising trade would be the last thiscentury and the cost of failure could not be measured.    Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at awelcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that greatprogress had been made in preparing for the negotiations whichmust not be sidetracked.    "We live in troubled and dangerous times for the worldtrading system," he said.    "We have seen that the failure of the world trading systemhas caused great depression and conflict in the past. Ourfailure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to usall," Moore said.    He added: "The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It isour last hope and best opportunity this century. We will notget another chance before the year 2000."    The ministers are in New Zealand to review world tradesince the "Uruguay round" talks last Sepember. The meeting isalso part of preparations for a full-scale conference of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice inJune.    The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to havebeen particularly successful, with northern hemispherecountries managing to have service industries such as bankingand insurance included in the next full round.    The southerners' goal of including agricultural andtropical products also was met.    The meeting at this North Island tourist resort isdescribed by participants as informal and no declaration isexpected.    Moore said one aim was to "instil a sense of politicalurgency to avert potential economic tragedy."    Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade topeople who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see thebenefits, as well as preventing "bush fires of confrontationwhile we proceed with orderly negotiations."    The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegationsincluding representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.    The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter.    American sources say he is ready to state that the best wayto reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is toimplement four key Uruguay proposals:    -- an end to agricultural subsidies;    -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATTregulations;    -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-calledintellectual property such as trademarks, patents andcopyrights;    -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92member states.    Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign TradeMinister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talksfor domestic political reasons.

JAPAN SAYS IT TRYING TO EXPAND DOMESTIC DEMAND Japan has assured a meetingof trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domesticdemand and restructure its economy.    Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informalGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that, inaddition to demand boosting measures adopted last September, acomprehensive economic program will be prepared after the1987/88 budget is approved.    Hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting,said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuringthe economy, but did not elaborate.    Hata said protectionist pressures in the internationaleconomy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits,payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries.    Despite great potential, developing economies are stillconfronted by grave difficulties, particularly debt, he added.    The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declarationlast September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and the subsequenttrade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva.    "It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitmentto implementing that plan as scheduled," Hata said.    Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiationsin some areas at the expense of others.    In order to rebuild the free trade system, it is importantfor each participant to have domestic policies that will servethis end.    As part of its contribution, Japan plans in April tofundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences forindustrial and mining products to make Japan's domestic marketmore open to developing countries, he said.

AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SAYS AGRICULTURE GATT PRIORITY Australian Trade MinisterJohn Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reformit will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis.    In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministersconference here he said agriculture is a problem which involvesall countries and seriously affects the debt servicingabilities of a number of developing countries.     He said major countries should be showing leadership onthis problem.    "We will be giving close attention to the processes in theOECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) andelsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we willbe looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment toagricultural trade reform," Dawkins said.    The Venice summit is scheduled for June.    He said Australia's interests in the Uruguay Round, theeighth under the GATT, are wide ranging. Dawkins said he seesthe round as providing a timely opportunity to secure furthermeaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restoreconfidence in the multilateral system.    Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groupsestablished in Geneva after the GATT declaration last Septemberin Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, butit is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on theseprocesses.    "We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este onstandstill and rollback are carried into practice."    The standstill and rollback of protection offers the globaltrading system a chance to hold and wind back protection duringthe negotiations which are expected to last up to four years,he said. REUTER

NEXT WORLD TRADE NEGOTIATIONS MUST SUCCEED - NZ Ministers from more than 20nations were told by New Zealand that the next internationalnegotiations on liberalising trade would be the last thiscentury and the cost of failure could not be measured.    Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at awelcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that greatprogress had been made in preparing for the negotiations whichmust not be sidetracked.    "We live in troubled and dangerous times for the worldtrading system," he said.    "We have seen that the failure of the world trading systemhas caused great depression and conflict in the past. Ourfailure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to usall," Moore said.   "The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our lasthope and best opportunity this century. We will not get anotherchance before the year 2000," he added.    The ministers are in New Zealand to review world tradesince the "Uruguay round" talks last September. The talks are also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice.    The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to havebeen particularly successful, with northern hemispherecountries managing to have service industries such as bankingand insurance included in the next full round.    The southerners' goal of including agricultural andtropical products also was met.    The meeting at this North Island tourist resort isdescribed by participants as informal and no declaration isexpected.    Moore said one aim was to "instil a sense of politicalurgency to avert potential economic tragedy."    Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade topeople who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see thebenefits, as well as preventing "bush fires of confrontationwhile we proceed with orderly negotiations."    The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegationsincluding representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.    The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter.    American sources say he is ready to state that the best wayto reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is toimplement four key Uruguay proposals:    -- an end to agricultural subsidies;    -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATTregulations;    -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-calledintellectual property such as trademarks, patents andcopyrights;    -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92member states.    Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign TradeMinister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talksfor domestic political reasons.

JAPAN IN LAST DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE CHIP PACT Japan has launched a last-ditch effort tosalvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States -sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out itscase and instructing its producers to cut output further.    "We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,"Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) DeputyDirector General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters.    "If hasty action is taken in the United States, it willcreate very serious problems."    The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected tomeet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateralagreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreedto stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and toincrease its imports of American semiconductors.    Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal byselling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boostAmerican imports, and has threatened to take retaliatoryaction.    In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanesechip makers to limit production in the hope that will boostdomestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.    Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobitdynamic random access and erasable programmable read onlymemory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows acutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of theyear.    He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply ofchips available for export through unregulated distributors inthe so-called grey market.    "We have almost no grey market," he said. "Supply isdiminishing."    To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITIcalled in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker,NEC Corp <NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuingspecific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiaryof <Texas Instruments Inc>.    Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out thesteps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed forU.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.    The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State GeorgeSchultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce SecretaryMalcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.    The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, areexpected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip makerMicron Technology Inc <DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales inHong Kong.    Yamamoto admitted that <Oki Electric Industry Co>'s HongKong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level butdenied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.    "If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...Wewill present our rebuttal," he said.    The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI'sadvice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well aboveproduction costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.    He also called the case "strange," but he stopped short ofendorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had beentrapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micronpublicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same daythey were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person whohad bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.

YEUTTER SEES GATT CONSENSUS ON FARM TRADE REFORM U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reacheda general consensus on agricultural trade reform under thelatest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT).    Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding buttold journalists the consensus covers the principles involvedin agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done toimprove the global situation in agriculture.    Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally todiscuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launchedin Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.    Yeutter said "at least people seem to be going down the sameroad...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations isanother matter entirely."    There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal withthe problem quickly and "a more common understanding of how weare going to get from here to there," Yeutter said.    However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple ofyears of tough negotiations ahead, he said.    "It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to ploughimmense amounts of financial resources into the production ofitems that nobody wants to buy," he said.    He said the long-term answer is to switch some of thefinancial resources now committed to agriculture to other moreproductive areas. This would help agriculture because some itsinefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, hesaid.    Individual segments in many countries may lose in theprocess, but it should result in a more rational system ofworld-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.    It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach arelatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably morethan that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,he said.    Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture inthe negotiations, he said "one has to be politicallyrealistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agriculturaltrade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have tobe as part of a larger package." REUTER
GATT ROUND MAY STOP GROWING TRADE PROBLEMS - U.S. A successful new GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed tohalt growing bilateral trade problems between major tradingpartners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.    Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerialtalks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasingbecause the multilateral system is inefficient.    "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATTround," he said. "The very existence of all these bilateralirritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateralsolutions to some of these problems."    The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Puntadel Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and serviceswere included in the negotiations for the first time.    The growing debt burden of Latin American and Africannations will also provide impetus for the GATT round tosucceed, he said.    "Clearly those countries need to develop their exportendeavours and they need open markets for that to happen andthat's the basic objective of the new GATT round," he said.    But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. Itwill not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries,but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.    "It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint becausethese debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,"he said.    "They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT roundas a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or makingpossible debt amortisation in the future," he said. REUTER

GATT ROUND MAY STOP GROWING TRADE PROBLEMS: U.S. A successful new GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed tohalt growing bilateral trade problems between major tradingpartners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.    Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerialtalks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasingbecause the multilateral system is inefficient.    "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATTround," he said. "The very existence of all these bilateralirritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateralsolutions to some of these problems."    The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Puntadel Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and serviceswere included in the negotiations for the first time.    The growing debt burden of Latin American and Africannations will also provide impetus for the GATT round tosucceed, he said. "Clearly those countries need to develop theirexport endeavours and they need open markets for that to happenand that's the basic objective of the new GATT round."    But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. Itwill not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries,but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.    "It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint becausethese debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,"he said.    "They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT roundas a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or makingpossible debt amortisation in the future," he said. Reuter
INDONESIA URGED TO DEREGULATE ITS ECONOMY World Bank President Barber Conablelinked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World'ssixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade anddismantle protectionist barriers.    "We would like to see the Indonesian government continue theadjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulationof the economy," Conable told a press conference at the end of athree-day visit to Jakarta.    Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia'shard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by thegovernment to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency.    The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlrtrade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend onthe economic policies Indonesia adopted.    But he said that in meetings with both President Suhartoand leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specificpolicy changes.    "The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesiangovernment. We are not here to dictate to them," he stated.    Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badlyhit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenuesfrom crude exports in half.    Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morningwith Suharto.    He voiced support for measures already taken, includingSeptember's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts toderegulate imports and stimulate exports.    "The government can rely on the support of the World Bank ina continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities oftoday's world," he said.    The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over thepast 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year.    The World Bank would probably like to see furtherdismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduceIndonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plasticsand cement, western bankers and diplomats said.    The government has already said it will announce furtherderegulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is alsoconsidering selling off loss-making state companies.    Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia findfunds to cover its share of development projects, whichotherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed. Japan's Ex-Imbank announced a 900 mln dlr untied credit last month. REUTER

U.S. HOUSE PANEL EASES SOVIET EXPORT CONTROLS The U.S. House Foreign AffairsCommittee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are nowkept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer athreat to U.S. national security.    The Democratic-controlled committee said theadministration's export control policies, which restrictshipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year'srecord 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.    The committee said the legislation will cut government redtape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete withforeign producers since many of the goods are readily availablefrom other countries.    Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International EconomicPolicy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had costthe U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year.    "This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack thetrade deficit in a positive way by exporting more," theWashington Democrat said.    The legislation would order the Commerce Department to liftcontrols on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list overthe next three years unless other countries agree to comparablecontrols.    Most of these are of the least sophisticated type oftechnology such as medical instruments.    It would also give the Commerce Department primaryauthority to decide which exports will be permitted and limitthe Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewingrequests to export highly-sensitive technology.

UNIONIST URGES RETALIATION AGAINST JAPAN William Bywater, president of theInternational Union of Electronic Workers, called on PresidentReagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices insemiconductor trade.    He said in a statement a crash program was needed in thesemiconductor industry to prevent the United States frombecoming "one of the world's industrial lightweights."    Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic PolicyCouncil prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide whatsanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement.    The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to endselling semiconductors at below cost and to open its homemarket to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to foregoantidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.    But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stoppeddumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third countrydumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.    Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way toforce prices up and end the dumping.    Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense ScienceBoard task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop newelectronic products and manufacturing processes and make theU.S. industory more competitive.    But he added the industry could not wait for legislation topass and that action was required now to help the depressedelectronic industry.    Bywater said, "I urge the Reagan Administration to take fulland severe action immediately against Japan by invoking theretaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)."

CANADA VOWS TO FIGHT U.S. POTASH ACTION External Affairs Minister Joe Clarktoday vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. actionagainst Canadian potash exports, but also warned againstraising the alarm too early in the dispute.    In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations,the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimouslyMonday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 millionU.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry.    "We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure thatCanadian interests are well protected," Clark told the House ofCommons in the daily question period.    But he said the opposition parties should be careful "notto raise false alarms too early."    The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department'strade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potashproducers from New Mexico, claiming unfair governmentsubsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments.    Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a thirdgoing to the U.S.    Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer,comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan.    In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded theruling as just another "trade harrassment" from the U.S. andcriticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would beprotected.    "We received exactly the same kind of assurances in thesoftwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,"Axworthy said.    Canada's Progressive Conservative government agreed toimpose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlierthis year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute withthe U.S.    Axworthy urged the government to present Canada's case toworld trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another exampleof why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateralirritants in the free trade negotiations under way with theU.S.    "What we are seeking to do is put in place a bettersystem," Clark said.    Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressedconfidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problemstems from low international commodity prices and notgovernment subsidies.    "The reality of the problem and the injury is causedworldwide," he said. "It's caused by a downturn in thecommodity price for fertilizer, whether it's potash fertilizer,nitrogen fertilizer or whatever." Reuter

Lee Ming-Yi, deputy director of the ministry's IndustrialDevelopment and Investment Centre, said the forecast rise isdue to planned government incentives and growing willingnessamong Taiwanese to invest abroad.    Lee told Reuters the incentives, to be introduced in May orJune, include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisationrequirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U.S. To 10mln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln.

KEY U.S. HOUSE PANEL FINISHES MAJOR TRADE BILL The House Ways and Means Committeecompleted action on legislation to toughen U.S. trade laws,chairman Dan Rostenkowski said.    The committee's consideration of one of the mostcontroversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surpluscountries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States,was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, itssponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said.    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told Reuters he was notcertain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposalwould take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries suchas Japan.    The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces PresidentReagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violateinternational trade agreements but it allows him to waveretaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S.economy.    The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisionsto grant domestic industries import relief.    It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign tradepractices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. Thesepowers are currently held by President Reagan.    The administration has strongly objected to this transferof authority from Reagan to Yeutter.    The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiatemultilateral trade agreements.

U.S. SENATE TRADE LEADER CONCERNED ABOUT CANADA The chairman of the U.S. Senatecommittee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concernedabout a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted bythe Canadian House of Commons last week.    The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral tradingagreement with the United States while protecting Canadianpolitical sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketingsystems, the auto industry and Canada's cultural identity.    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said theresolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed freetrade agreement between the two countries, which are eachother's largest trading partners.    "We need a truly free trade agreement, which means bothcountries have to work toward a deal that is mutuallybeneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement," the TexasDemocrat said in a statement.    "I do not question Canada's right to protect its politicalsovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrasesmean the government of Canada means to take important economicissues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeplyconcerned," he added.    Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways whilethe United States uses only six trade restriction methods. Hesaid if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries getrid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fairand might not win Senate approval.    "I am deeply concerned that when the President visits PrimeMinister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented withthis kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I didwhen I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficialagreement will be successful," Bentsen said.    Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 5-6 inOttawa.

He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year scheduleagreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year.

Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATTround include reform of trade in merchandise and services.

It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, nofast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track -and that's all," de Clercq said.

NO PESSIMISM FOR GERMAN EXPORTERS, MINISTRY Firms need not be pessimistic about exportprospects even though foreign markets have become moredifficult because of the mark's strength the Economics Ministrysaid.     The ministry's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georgvon Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports couldstart rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing thelower export trend which emerged in mid-1986.    But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be noneed to worry about the economy as long as the weakness ofexports did not affect currently good domestic demand.    Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good butnoted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. "Thisis certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not forstimulative steps," he said.    The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to workactively to promote free world trade, he added.    Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good exportopportunities. Price alone was not the only factor ininternational competitiveness, he said, adding German firmshave a reputation for high quality standards, prompt deliverytimes and good service.    Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficultposition on its trade figures.  It faced international pressureto reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worriedabout the effect of the mark's strength on the country'sexporters.    Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas,tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to arecord 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise wasdue entirely to the lower value of imports caused by thedecline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports havein fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.

The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecastmade by the Treasury last October.    Bank Negara also said in its annual report that grossnational product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct,after declining 7.3 pct in 1986.    It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since lastNovember had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil andcommodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports.    Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipatedrise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustaintheir average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added.    Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil willaverage 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palmoil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a riseof 12 pct in manufacturing exports.    It said Malaysia's international terms of trade will turnaround to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in1986 and five pct in 1985.

BRITISH POLITICIANS URGE JAPAN TRADE SANCTIONS One hundred members of Britain's rulingConservative Party have signed a motion calling for tradesanctions against Japan to force Tokyo to open its domesticmarket to British goods.    The government announced last week that Japan had a 5.9billion dlr trade surplus with Britain in 1986.    The Department of Trade and Industry said the governmentwas drawing up contingency plans to force Japan into opening upits domestic markets but a spokesman said such moves were verymuch a last resort.    Ideas being considered included blocking Japanese companiesfrom trading in Britain and revoking licenses of Japaneseoperations in the London financial district. Reuter
WHITE HOUSE UNIT DECIDES ON SEMICONDUCTORS The White House Economic PolicyCouncil made a recommendation to President Reagan whether toretaliate against Japan for alleged unfair practices insemiconductor trade, U.S. officials said.    They would not disclose the council's recommendation, butthe officials said earlier it was likely the council would callfor retaliation and urge that curbs be imposed on Japaneseexports to the United States.    The officials said it might be several days before Reaganwould act and his moves made public.    The Senate last week unanimously called on Reagan to imposepenalities on Japanese exports. Retaliation was also called forby the semiconductor industry and its chief trade union, bothhard hit by Japanese semiconductor trade.    In a pact last summer, Japan summer agreed to stop dumpingits semiconductors at less than cost in the United States andother nations and to open its own market to the U.S. products.    In return, the United States agreed to hold up imposinganti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments.    U.S. officials say that while Japan has stopped dumpingsemiconductors on the American market, they have continued todump them in third countries and that the Japanese market hasremained all but closed to the U.S. semiconductors.semiconductors on the American market, they have continued todump them in third countries and that the Japanese market hasremained all but closed to the U.S. semiconductors. reuter
GATT WARNS U.S. ON FEDERAL BUDGET, PROTECTIONISM The United States' emphasis on itsforeign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's realproblem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the GeneralAgreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.     By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billiondlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressurewhich threatens the world trading system, it said in an annualreport.    The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federalbudget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting governmentspending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt,it said.    GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pctin 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of theprevious two years.    GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism andinstead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the currentaccount payments deficit -- higher private savings, lowerinvestment and a smaller federal budget deficit.    Raising U.S. Trade barriers "would result in little or noreduction in the current account deficit. It would, however,increase inflation and reduce world trade," it said.    "The basic cause -- some combination of insufficientdomestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- wouldremain," the report said.    GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this yearbecause of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some WestEuropean nations as they adjust production and workforces to alow dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over ThirdWorld debt management and looming protectionism.    The report also said imbalances in the current accounts ofJapan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.    The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changeswere not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.    "Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reducedas a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was notborne out last year," the report said.    GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in theU.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidlyexpanding money supply and low dollar.    "Such a development could worsen the business climate byincreasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, inturn, would adversely affect world trade."    But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to theUnited States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makesforeign products more expensive.    It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both humanand in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce thegoods and services sought from abroad.    World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,about half of the rate of the previous year.    Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATTsaid.    Developing countries' exports declined significantly, whiletheir imports increased moderately, although full statisticsare not available yet, GATT said.    The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nationswere sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports. REUTER
WHITE HOUSE PANEL SAID URGING JAPAN RETALIATION The White House Economic PolicyCouncil decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan forviolations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement,industry sources said.    They would give no details, noting that the White House hadnot commented on the decision. The administration has beenunder pressure to retaliate.    There was no immediate announcement on the council'sdecision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the seniorpolicy group's move on curbs reflected growing Americanfrustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices.    U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act onthe recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aideson the foreign policy implications of retaliation.    The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for alast try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reachedlast July governing trade in semiconductors.    Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumpingsemiconductors in world markets and to open its own market toU.S.-made semiconductors.    In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumpingduties on Japanese semiconductor shipments.    The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S.Market but has continued in third countries, and that theJapanese market remains closed.    The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimouscall by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanesehigh technology products containing semiconductors.    A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductorindustry and from its chief trade union.    U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japanwould involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such astelevisions, video cassette recorders and computers. REUTER

WORLD BANK CHIEF URGES MORE JAPANESE INVESTMENT World Bank President Barber Conablecalled on Japan to boost investment in developing nations, forits own sake as well as that of the world economy.    "Japan has the means to make a major contribution todevelopment in the Third World," he told about 500 Japanesebusinessmen and academics. "I would be pleased with additionalsupport."    With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets, Japancould do more to help assist indebted Third World countriesdevelop roads, bridges and other infrastructure, he said.    Conable said additional commercial bank investment wouldalso be to Japan's advantage.    It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplusinto Third World economies -- notably those in South America,China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than thosein the developed world, he said.    Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank'sconcessionary lending affiliate, the International DevelopmentAssociation (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand itscontribution to another affiliate, the International Bank forReconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted.    Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structuraladjustment loans, designed to encourage developing countries toopen their economies more to free competition and trade.    "Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bankloans) in the near future, though maybe not this year," Conabletold Reuters after his speech.

NAKASONE HARD-PRESSED TO SOOTHE U.S ANGER ON TRADE Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone willvisit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S.Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats saidthey believed his chances of success were slim.    Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups andwidespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will behard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.    News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincidedwith news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surpluslast month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.    It also came one day after the Reagan Administration'sEconomic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory actionagainst Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a jointtrade agreement on computer microchips.    Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - onedesigned to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in theshort-term, the other to redirect the country in the mediumterm away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.    But government officials said political infighting couldrob both packages of much of their punch and might even preventone from seeing the light of day.    Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw upa package of short-term economic measures until after its1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that wouldamount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.    But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time forhis trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott byopposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.    Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to theU.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his rulingLiberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its ownmeasures.    He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basisof the government's plans, without losing face in parliamentover the budget, political analysts said.    Officials working on the government's short-term economicpackage said it would probably include interest rate cuts onloans by government corporations, deregulation, measures topass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers inthe form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.    They said a record portion of state investment planned forthe entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the firsthalf, probably over 80 pct.    Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfyReagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American tradedeficit.    To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is alsolikely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-termeconomic plans.    A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japangovernor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a finalreport outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy daysbefore Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.    Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up toMaekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and arelikely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas asagricultural reform and land policy, officials said.    While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailedas possible, they said the political realities might force themto water down some of the committee's recommendations.    A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economymight look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoesmassive restructuring, officials said. The subcommitteeprojects that the current account surplus will fall to lessthan two pct of Japan's total output, or gross nationalproduct, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, whichmeasures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pctof gnp.    The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth forJapan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradualappreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around1993, from 150 now.

INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP India is searching for non-communistcountertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit andconserve foreign exchange.    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering andelectronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, areall on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State TradingCorp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).    "The two state trading corporations are free to use theirbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indianexports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding thatprivate firms are excluded from countertrading.    One trade source said India has targetted countries thatdepend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreignimports.    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small partof India's total trading and are likely to account for lessthan eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in tradeduring the nine months ended December, the sources said.    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the EasternBloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps ofagricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crudeoil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,against three billion in 1985/86.    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to helpnarrow the country's large trade deficit, is stillinsignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billionin the current fiscal year.    But the push to include non-communist countries incountertrade is also due to other factors, including the slowgrowth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promotingcountertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were madediscreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannotofficially support bartering.    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron oreexports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.    "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause thatpreference will be given to parties who accept payment in kindfor goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,adding that the policy remains flexible.    "We also take into account other factors such as prices atwhich the goods and services are offered to India," the tradeofficial said.    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreigncompanies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigsand railway equipment to India that they stood a better chanceif they bought Indian goods or services in return, the tradesources said.    Illustrating the point, the official said a South Koreanfirm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mlndlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. Reuter
REAGAN READY TO IMPOSE TRADE CURBS AGAINST JAPAN President Reagan was ready to imposeretaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking itssemiconductor agreement with the United States, White Houseofficials said.

JAPAN'S CHIP MAKERS ANGERED BY U.S. SANCTION PLANS Japanese computer chip makers reactedangrily to news the United States plans to take retaliatoryaction against them for allegedly failing to live up to anagreement on trade in computer microchips.    Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) ChairmanShoichi Saba stated: "EIAJ believes that it is premature andeven irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of theagreement and our efforts to comply with it only six monthsafter concluding the agreement."    "We urge U.S. Governmental authorities to reconsider thedecision made, to evaluate fairly the results of Japaneseefforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement, and toresist emotional biases," he said.    Yesterday, Washington announced plans to slap as much as300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation forwhat is sees as Japan's failure to comply with the terms of thepact.    The agreement, struck late last year after months of heatednegotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chipson world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.    To salvage the pact, Tokyo has instructed its chip makersto slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateralorganisation designed to promote chip imports.    Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged threemln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation andexpressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join.    "This suggests that American semiconductor manufacturers maynot be really interested in participating in the Japanesemarket," he said. REUTER
NAKASONE SOUNDS CONCILIATORY NOTE IN CHIP DISPUTE Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone soundeda conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with theUnited States over trade in computer microchips.

Government officials said Japan would make a formal requestnext week for emergency talks and that the two sides wouldprobably meet the week after, just days before the April 17deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.    Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japaninvestigation of American claims that Japanese companies aredumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.    Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronicgoods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure tolive up to their bilateral chip pact.    That agreement, hammered out late last year after months ofheated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-pricechips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips.    Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatorythan those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,who earlier today said Japan was ready to take "appropriatemeasures" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions.    Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura'sremark and said that his main message was that the two sidesneed to talk urgently about the issue.    But they admitted that Japan was considering taking theUnited States to GATT, the Geneva-based internationalorganization which polices world trade, if Washington imposedthe tariffs.    Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), theysaid. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panelto consider the legality of the U.S. Action.    But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. "Itmay be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the UnitedStates may lift its decision at an early date," Tamura said.    In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, PresidentRonald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he hadevidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in worldmarkets and had opened up its own market to imports.    Japanese government officials said they are confident theycan make the pact work.    They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chipsthrough unregulated distributors has all but dried up afterMITI instructed domestic makers to cut output.    While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japaneseimports of American chips, MITI officials said that theministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens.    The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users,some of whom are also leading producers, to step up theirpurchases of foreign semiconductors.

TOKYO BIDS TO STOP CHIP ROW TURNING INTO TRADE WAR Japan is seeking to prevent its computerchips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scaletrade war, government officials said.

Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and anangry American Congress, the Japanese government has beenforced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductordispute, trade analysts said.    They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largestchip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as thedraconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,included enforced production cuts.

JAPAN HAS LITTLE NEW TO OFFER IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE The Japanese government appears to havelittle new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Overcomputer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.    The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., Inretaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on themicrochip trade signed last September.    A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters "Japan has donewhat it can, and now we must persuade the United States to waitfor those steps to take effect."    The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the Septemberagreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost innon-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S.Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.     Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cutproduction in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold inthird countries at non-regulated prices.    "I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has," saidJardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.    A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to callfor production cuts beyond those already sought, although itwould continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.    Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said theywould consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a MatsushitaElectric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase inimports was not likely.    Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit ifthe United States did implement the tariffs, which would belevied on consumer electronics products rather than onmicrochips themselves.    "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,"said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.    "The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to bestopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will bedelayed for another year," he said.    Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry bystepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japanfor semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.    "The American approach is full of contradictions," JardineFleming's Edwards said.    "If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing theywant to do is hit the makers of the final products because thathurts the final market," Edwards said.    But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but alsofrustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analystsargued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may haveto take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.    Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,said "The major overall issue is to stimulate the domesticeconomy and move away from an export-dependent economy." REUTER

They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largestchip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as thedraconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,included enforced production cuts.    The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to theannouncement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficultiesthe government faces in taking further action.    "Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with theU.S./Japan agreement," said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of theElectronic Industries Association of Japan.    He accused the U.S. of being "irrational." He said the U.S.action had made the bilateral chip pact "meaningless."    Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the disputethrough consultations.    Japan is expected to send a high-level official toWashington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not togo ahead with the tariffs on April 17.    Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industryplans to step up purchases of U.S. chips and to propose a jointinvestigation into U.S. allegations of chip dumping. Reuter
BALDRIGE PREDICTS END OF U.S.-JAPAN TRADE DISPUTE The United States and Japan willsoon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors, U.S.Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television.    Baldrige, referring to the U.S.-Japan trade agreement onsemiconductors, said: "Their government wants to live up to it.Their industries haven't been doing it, and I think we'll havea good settlement to spare both sides."    "I think the Japanese understand full well that they haven'tlived up to this commitment," he said.    He added: "I do not think there will be a trade war at all."    On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17,because of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement.    The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon asJapan started adhering to the agreement. But they said therewas little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert thehigher tariffs.    Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strongU.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone downprotectionist trade legislation now being drafted.    He denied the action had been taken for that reason. REUTER

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. CONGRESS RAPS JAPAN The U.S. Congress is making Japan,with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of theU.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn aroundAmerica's record trade deficit.    "Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: thechallenge to our high technology industries, the threat ofgovernment nutured competition, and the multitude of barriersto our exports," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.    "If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over tradeproblems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,"the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committeehearing on the trade bill.    Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, havemade trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-rangingbill is being readied for probable House approval next month.    Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrsin 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.    Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. tradedeficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance tothe dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason topress Japan to buy more U.S. goods.    They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deteriorationin U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.    In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced heintended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japaneseelectronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide bya 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.    Congress also has been been angered by the administration'slack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issuesincluding beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunicationsgoods, and financial services.    The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week infour committees. It is a package of trade sanctions andmeasures to force the administration take tough action againstforeign trade barriers and unfair competition.    Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in manycases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japaneseproducts or make them more expensive with higher duties.    The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the HouseWays and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is toforce President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreigncompetition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to wintemporary relief from surges in imports.    The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrictimports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do notbuy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirantfrom Missouri, has the support of Wright and other keyDemocrats to press for passage of the amendment.    The measure would have the most impact on Japan, WestGermany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, doesnot reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States wouldset import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten percent a year for three years.    "I'm tired of going into companies and having managers sayto me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can'tcompete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be takenaway from American business," Gephardt said.    The administration has said it could not support a tradebill containing such a provision.    
U.S. TRADE OFFICIAL SAYS JAPAN ACTION FOOLISH A high level U.S. trade officialsaid it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against theUnited States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductorelectronics products.    Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliateagainst U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce BruceSmart replied, "That would be the height of foolishness."    In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress inmeeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actualimposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17.    Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the UnitedStates last year has come under fire in Congress concernedabout the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with therecord 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986.    President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today fromthe two Democratic leaders of Congress.    "I think it's about time," Senate Democratic Leader RobertByrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wrightof Texas told reporters before the opening of the Housesession, "It just shows we were right all along when we saidsomething needs doing."    Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearingthat last Friday's U.S. trade action would help U.S.negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts.    Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open upJapan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Lastyear, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with theUnited States in these products.    Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987.    "It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. Ihope it will persuade them we're serious," Smart said of theWhite House trade sanctions.    The United States has tried to convince Japanese carcompanies of the quality of American-made parts and to drawthem away from their traditional Japanese suppliers.    "All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading themwe can do better than our reputation seems to be," he said.    Measured per car, each American-made car contained about700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made carcontained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said. Reuter
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY TO SET UP OFFICE IN PEKING China and the European Community (EC)signed an agreement on the establishment of an EC office here.    Chinese vice-foreign minister Zhou Nan and the EC'sexternal relations commissioner, Willy De Clercq, signed theaccord. EC sources said the office was likely to open in thesecond half of this year.    In 1986 the EC was China's third largest trading partner,with Chinese imports from the EC worth 5.7 billion dlrs andexports worth 2.6 billion dlrs.    De Clercq told the official China Daily that more jointventures should be set up in China as a way of reducing China'strade deficit with the EC.

TRADE FRICTION THREATENS TO TOPPLE NAKASONE Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may havebeen dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapidrise and the threat of a trade war with the United States,political analysts said.    Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reformplan, may now be forced to resign before the June economicsummit of seven industrialised nations if local elections laternext month go against candidates from his ruling LiberalDemocratic Party (LDP), they said.    "The close relationship between Nakasone and PresidentReagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,"Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchidatold Reuters. "So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damagesNakasone."    Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone wasencountering criticism not only from opposition parties butalso within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax.    "Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves fromNakasone," Uchida said. "His position within the LDP itself isnot so strongly established today."    Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general publicthan with many LDP members, is now seeing his public supporteroded, the analysts said.    The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat onFriday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods inretaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip tradepact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, theanalysts said.    "Apparently the special relationship between Reagan andNakasone hasn't worked effectively," Rei Shiratori, director ofthe Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said.    This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone'scredibility, Shiratori told Reuters.    The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen'srise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP lossesin the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said.    "If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have toresign early," Shiratori said.    But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempersbefore or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29,some analysts said.    However, "unless the Japanese political system can move morequickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take toWashington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a veryhostile audience," said Merrill Lynch Securities economistWilliam Sterling.    "If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put thefinal nail in his coffin," he said.    Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growingRepublican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argueagainst a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analystssaid.    But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupledwith uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors toNakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over thedifferences and aid Nakasone, they said.    "One factor against a trade war may be that Washington isnot anxious to push Nakasone into his grave," Sterling said. REUTER
 EUROPE ON SIDELINES IN U.S-JAPAN MICROCHIP ROW Rising imports of Japanese-made cars andelectronic goods may upset West European officials, but theygenerally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latesttrade row between the United States and Japan.    Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe,as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair tradepractices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.    The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficitwith Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanesetrade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.    But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of actingwith the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus.    "The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is theU.S.," said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade PolicyResearch Centre in London. "Basically, their policies are prettymuch the same."    But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Orthat the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage ofthe U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.    "In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here," headded. "In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic offree competition, while in Europe, the general approach is thatliberal trade is good because it makes countries rich."    Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington'stendency to impose so-called "countervailing duties" - an importtax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.    In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends tobe to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.    In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan hasthreatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronicgoods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan hasfailed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.    But the European Community has challenged the agreement asa violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.    "It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side ofthe United States in defence of the agreement," said Wolf.    Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a toughline on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the restof Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC takethe lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels toldReuters there has been no change in the Community's positionsince a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent astrong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.    In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreignministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance andappealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said afterthe talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.    Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw nosigns of any immediate intention to impose any broad-rangingsanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking atrade war, they said.    Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas inEuropean trade with Japan, including wines and spirits,cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking totry to improve the situation, the diplomats said.    In Britain, where the government is angered over thedifficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless hasfaced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials saidlast week that retaliatory action is being considered.    But government officials said last night, "We are nottalking about days or weeks. This is going to take time."    They said the government would consider its options at acabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisionswere expected. The main thing the British would threaten theJapan with is denial of access to London's booming financialmarkets, government officials said. REUTER
THATCHER SAYS TRADE TARGETS SET WITH MOSCOW British Prime Minister Margaret Thatchersaid she and Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov had set targets forincreased trade between the two countries during talks earliertoday.    She said she hoped more economic exchanges between Britainand the Soviet Union "will also lead to increased friendship andincreased understanding."    Earlier, she told a meeting of Soviet and Britishbusinessmen that she had agreed with Ryzhkov that they wouldwork to achieve a total volume of 2.5 billion roubles inbilateral trade by 1990.    This would entail an increase by each side of 350 to 400mln stg over their present export levels.

JAPAN TO CUT MICROCHIP OUTPUT, BOOST IMPORTS Leading domestic semiconductor makerswill boost imports and cut production of key memory microchipsfrom next month in line with government attempts to ward offU.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.    The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off thesanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of theplans, analysts said.    The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth ofproducts and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure tohonour a semiconductor trade pact.    In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagansaid Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatorypricing and open Japan's market to foreign products.    But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter saidyesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to dropthe tariffs if Japan shows a "clear indication" that it will openits markets to U.S. Goods.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) hasurged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in thesecond quarter, following a call to reduce production by morethan 20 pct the previous quarter.    MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports.    Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington tocancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan.    "The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its swordand shown that it can and will do business," said analyst NickEdwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo.    But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers cancut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal ofthe sanctions -- is more difficult.    "The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's(integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumerproducts. They're well supplied here," said Richard May, senioranalyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo.    The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's,but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-endproduction skills, the analysts said.    "The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses onsemiconductors in return for free access to other areas," saidEdwards.    A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T>, said the firm'sreduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory(256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off thetrade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result ofthe company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said.    Company officials unveiled the following plans -    - NEC Corp <NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans toslash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct tosix mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln lastquarter.     In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chipimports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chipconsumption the year before.    - Hitachi Ltd's <HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM's willfall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. Thecompany is trying to boost imports but has not set a specifictarget. Imports are currently very low.    - Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAMproduction by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and isconsidering ways to boost imports, a company official said.    Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sellthe U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning ajoint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northernJapan.    - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim secondquarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mlnchips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increasedimports but an official said "boosting imports will be difficultas it depends on sales demand."    - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord withMITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels.    - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce Aprilproduction by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln. Oki is studying waysto increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginningApril 1 from the previous year's total of more than fivebillion yen, a company official said. REUTER

SOVIET UNION SEEN WATCHING CHINA GATT APPLICATION China's application to join the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is seen as a test case bythe Soviet Union, which will probably demand to follow China, atop European Community official said.    Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of theEuropean Communities, told a news conference that China'sapplication would involve long and difficult negotiations.    China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and inFebruary presented a memorandum backing its application, whichDe Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then bepresented to China.    "After China, other important state-trading countriesincluding the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession.China's application could be considered a test case," he said.    He said the EC strongly backed China's application, butothers among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.    Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economyentering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity andthe expectation that China will practice an open-trade policywithout trade discrimination, de Clercq added.    De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chineseeconomy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two currentSocialist GATT members.    On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchangeshortage would force China to import less this year and nextthan in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipmentand capital.

"In my judgement, we're not even close to a trade war,"Yeutter told a House Agriculture Committee hearing.    Yeutter said if Japan takes action to honor its agreementwith the U.S. on semiconductor trade, "Then the retaliatoryresponse will last a relatively short period."    Yeutter said Japan must stop dumping chips in thirdcountries and buy more American computer chips. Reuter
CHIRAC, REAGAN DISCUSS ARMS CONTROL, TRADE French Prime Minister Jacques Chiracopened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus onsuperpower arms control moves and trade issues.    French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was topresent France's concern that the United States might ignoreEuropean security interests in any accord with Moscow onremoving medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent.    But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will notagree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would givethe Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomatssaid.    France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missilesfrom Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge inother weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets,conventional forces and chemical weapons.    Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French positionsaying: "Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces shouldmention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles."    Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending adispute between two leading research institutes over patentrights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS.    In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the PasteurInstitute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, ofBethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties fromthe test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fightagainst AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).    "This agreement opens a new era in Franco-Americancooperation, allowing France and the United States to jointheir efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes ofspeeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure," Reagansaid at the signing ceremony.     He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation.    The foundation would also raise private funds and woulddonate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in lessdeveloped countries.     Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and theUnited States during a welcoming ceremony in the White HouseEast Room, with Reagan describing France as "America's oldestally in war and peace."     "I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by thesame ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangerswhich we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, newdiseases and drugs," Chirac replied.    But the two countries are likely to have less to agree onover the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a risein protectionism in the U.S. Congress.     A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea tosell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way oflessening surplus stocks.    Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, firstproposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume,during his two-day visit to Washington.    The U.S. official described the idea as a "grain producers'OPEC" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries -- and said it went against the Reaganadministration's desire to lessen government intervention intrade.

REAGAN RENEWS ANTI-PROTECTIONISM STAND, WHITE HOUSE SAYS TRADE WAR  Avery Inc said the company will notshow a profit in the next quarter and will probably not show aprofit in 1987.    Speaking at the annual shareholders meeting, chairmanNelson Peltz declined to estimate when the company would becomeprofitable.    Peltz said Uniroyal Chemical Co, acquired last year, wouldincrease Avery's operating earnings but that associatedacquisition costs would prevent Avery from posting net profitsfor some time.    At the meeting, stockholders approved an increase in theauthorized number of common shares to 200 mln from 15 mln.    In the fiscal year ended May 30, 1986, Avery reported aloss of 489,000 dlrs. The company has changed its fiscal yearto end Sept 30.    The increase in common shares would cover, among otherthings, the exercise of Triangle Industries Inc's <TRI> andDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc's warrants issued in relation toAvery's 710 mln dlr acquisition of Uniroyal Chemical late lastyear.

TRADE WAR FEARS MAY PROMPT STOCK MARKETS' DOWNTURN The threatened trade war between theUnited States and Japan is just the kind of shock thateconomists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.    But they are not so sure if that would be a briefcorrective dip, or whether this week's falling share pricesmark the start of a "bear" market.    "It's the billion dollar question," said Richard O'Brien,economist at American Express International Bank in London.    Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- haspoured into share and bond markets around the world, and fundeda good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third ofany new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by theJapanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as thedollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets itfall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart ofimproving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar orbecause the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budgetdeficit.   And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese willhave less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill thegap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. Thesubsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major fallson the world stock markets.    "A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,"said O'Brien. "Now, it is much less certain."    Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a boomingeconomy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best inthe industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt andhuge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien.    Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of SmithBarney Harris Upham said  "We're still in a bull market," addingthat corrections are a normal part of a rising market and "Thebear usually strikes slowly."    Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co inLondon, said the huge sums of money going through the worldfinancial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.    Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money innon-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's verydifficult to see where else they can put their money than inU.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,according to David Butcher, a senior executive at YamaichiSecurities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.    He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention nowto the French franc and West German mark.    In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions andthe dollar's slide will mean for securities markets. REUTER
WHITE HOUSE DISCOUNTS THREAT OF TRADE WAR President Reagan has reaffirmed hisopposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said tradesanctions imposed on Japan were unlikely to start a trade war.    "We don't want to go down that road," Reagan was quoted astelling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting Frenchofficial expressed concern about the rising tide ofprotectionist sentiment in the United States.    Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended thenew sanctions against Japan and said administration officials"do not believe this will result in a trade war."    "It is the first time that the United States has taken anaction of this type and it is significant but it is nothing tobe alarmed about," the presidential spokesman added.    "We do not want protectionism ... We do not want a tradewar," he said.    Fitzwater said the president was forced to act in theJapanese microchip case because Tokyo had failed to fulfill "anagreement to make some corrections."    Noting that there are "enormous pressures in the Congressand the land" for the United States to take a tough stand, hesaid, "This was a case where we felt we simply had to act."    Fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was "wellconsidered by this administration and not taken lightly."    While the White House official held open the possibilitythat Washington and Tokyo will settle their trade dispute, heindicated a settlement probably would not come in time to headoff the sanctions.    "We are always open to negotations ... Whether it (asettlement) could occur in time to prevent this (the sanctions)from going into effect is questionable at this point," thespokesman said.    The sanctions take effect in mid-April. REUTER
BALDRIGE SAYS U.S. TO GO AHEAD WITH JAPANESE S Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigesaid the United States would go ahead with planned 300 mln dlrsanctions against Japanese semiconductor exports, despite anyU.S. Japanese talks to avert the trade curbs.    He said in a speech to an export-import group that he wassure the United States and Japan could work out their disputeover unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade,but "I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out."    Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17.    He also said he did not think there would be a trade warwith Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to theUnited States to risk such a war.    "Those fears are unfounded," he said.    He told reporters later that the sharp drop in thesecurities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fearof inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact.    Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in thevalue of the dollar, although trade issues did have someeffect.    Baldrige said that observers who were attributing the dropin the market to trade sanctions were "barking up the wrongtree."    He said the market observers will realize this shortly.    Baldrige said his remarks did not mean to suggest anythingabout the market or the exchange rate of the dollar. Reuter

BROADER U.S. EEP SOUGHT BY REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS Republican members of the HouseAgriculture Committee said they will propose amendmentstomorrow to a pending trade bill increasing funding for theexport enhancement program, EEP, and significantly expandingthe scope of the program.    At a press conference, Republican lawmakers said they wouldpropose expanding EEP to include all countries "willing topurchase additional commodities at reasonable prices."    In addition, the Congressmen said they would proposeextending the life of EEP to five years from the current threeyears and increasing the EEP funding ceiling to 2.5 billiondlrs from 1.5 billion at present.    The Agriculture committee tomorrow will begin draftingamendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the House.    Responding to the Republican plan, Agriculture SecretaryRichard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said theyfavor a flexible, targeted use of EEP instead of anacross-the-board program which they termed too costly.    The Republican Congressmen also said they will offer anamendment to the trade bill instructing the U.S. AgricultureDepartment to value the bonus commodities used for EEP at themarket value, rather than the cost of acquisition.    But Lyng said USDA already plans to change to market valueaccounting rather than acquisition value, in order to avoidhitting a funding ceiling for eep of 1.5 billion dlrs.    Lyng said under market value accounting only about 700 mlndlrs of EEP commodities have been used to date. Usingacquisition value, USDA officials said the value is higher. Reuter

TAIWAN'S SECOND QUARTER IMPORTS SEEN RISING Taiwan's imports in the second quarter of1987 are expected to rise to 7.75 billion U.S. Dlrs from 5.82billion a year earlier and from 6.95 billion in the firstquarter of this year, the statistics department said.    A department official attributed the increase to growingdomestic investment by the private and public sectors. It isexpected to rise to 4.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from 3.79 billion ayear earlier and 3.41 billion during the first quarter.    Taiwan's exports in the April-June quarter are expected torise to 12.03 billion U.S. Dlrs from 9.63 billion a yearearlier and 11.28 billion in the first quarter.    The official said Taiwan's trade surplus is expected toclimb to 4.28 billion U.S. Dlrs in the second quarter of 1987from 3.81 billion a year earlier. It was 4.33 billion in thefirst quarter of this year.    Most of the surplus is expected to come from trade with theU.S., Taiwan's largest trading partner and importer of nearly50 pct of Taiwan's total exports, he said.    He said he expected Taiwan's imports, including grains,machinery and power plant equipment, from the U.S. To risesharply because of government efforts to balance trade withWashington.

JAPAN WARNS OF ANTI-U.S. SENTIMENT IN TRADE ROW Japan is sending a three-man team toWashington to try to halt threatened trade sanctions thatofficials warn could spark a wave of anti-U.S. Sentiment here.    The team will lay the groundwork for high-level emergencytalks next week aimed at defusing an increasingly bitter rowover trade in computer microchips, officials said.

Other officials were more blunt. "The U.S. Action will havea significant impact on the growing anti-U.S. Feeling (here),"another MITI official said.

YEUTTER STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF TRADE TALKS U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter stressed the importance of trade negotiations to openforeign markets rather than trade restrictions in a statementto the Senate Finance Committee.    "In the long term we cannot repeatedly bludgeon othernations into opening their markets with threats of U.S.restrictions. Rather, we must be able to negotiate credibly forglobal liberalization," Yeutter said.    Yeutter did not mention the recent U.S. trade sanctionsagainst Japanese semiconductors in his testimony on the pendingtrade bill.    Yeutter said the trade bill should increase U.S.competitiveness, aid U.S. trade negotiating leverage, and avoidprovoking foreign retaliation.    He urged Congress to reject provisions that would mandateU.S. retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices.    Yeutter emphasized the importance of the new multilateraltrade negotiating round and called on Congress to quicklyapprove an extension of U.S. negotiating authority.

EC PUBLISHES LIST OF U.S. BARRIERS TO FREE TRADE The European Community responded towidespread U.S. criticism of its trade policies by publishingan extensive list of U.S. actions which pose obstacles to ECexports.    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said the detailed25-page report of alleged malpractices was in response to asimilar document issued by U.S. Administration officials inNovember, and updated a previous EC list.    EC External Trade Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercqsaid its object was to show such actions were not solely takenby trading partners of the U.S. And that "the U.S. Were notinnocents in the matter."    The report covers the entire field of EC-U.S. Commercialrelations and lists more than 30 obstacles ranging from tariffmeasures, import quotas, customs duties, anti-dumpingprocedures, fiscal barriers and export subsidies.    The Commission said not all the barriers mentioned werenecessarily inconsistent with U.S. International obligations,and emphasised many of them could be removed at upcominginternational trade talks. "The purpose of the report is to makeclear that trade practices which impede exports are not aunique problem only faced by U.S. Exporters. Europeans facesimilar problems in the U.S.," it said.    Among the obstacles detailed in the report are importrestrictions on food products, such as cheese, sugar and syrup,certain wines, beers and juices, as well as on firearms andmachine tools.    It also criticises programs to boost U.S. Cereals exports.The document said the U.S.'s three-year export enhancementprogram (EEP), which began in 1985, had subsidised exports of9.7 mln tonnes of wheat, two mln tonnes of wheat flour and 2.8mln tonnes of barley up to mid-March this year. The subsidiesgranted so far were worth about 620 mln dlrs, it added.    "The Community has already reacted where necessary to U.S.EEP subsidies by increasing its exports refunds, and willcontinue to do so," it said, adding the current GATT round wouldalso provide an opportunity to address the subject.    The document also says import quotas maintained by the U.S.On a range of farm products, including sugar, peanuts andcertain cottons, restrict EC exports.    In addition, the report deplores a recent U.S.-Japan accordon semi-conductors, export controls on technology transfers,standards tests in the telecommunications arena and the U.S.Administration's "buy American" public procurement policy.

YEUTTER DOUBTS JAPAN CAN AVOID U.S. SANCTIONS U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said he doubted Japan could avoid the April 17imposition of U.S. tariffs on its semiconductor products.    The three high-level Japanese government representativeswho would be coming here in the next few days to discuss theissue would probably be unable to show evidence of continuedcompliance with the semiconductor trade agreement, Yeutter toldreporters.    "It would be impossible to provide evidence of compliancewith the agreement" based on sales of only a few days time, hesaid.    Asked by reporters if the sanctions were 100 pct certainfor April 17, he said, "One could never foreclose all options.We have an obligation to listen to the arguments our tradingpartners make."    He said the length of the sanctions will be determined byJapan and Japanese semiconductor firms.    "They would be lifted only when persuasive evidence provideddemonstrates compliance," he said.    "Whether a few weeks or a few months depends on theiractions," Yeutter added. Reuter
YEUTTER SEES POSSIBLE EUROPEAN, JAPAN RECESSION U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said a possible recession in western Europe or Japanwas possible as a result of the U.S. dollar's decline and theresulting drop in the U.S. trade deficit.    Yeutter told the Senate Finance Committee, "They certainlyhave the macroeconomic policy tools to adjust" to the U.S.reduction in imports.    Asked if the U.S. trade deficit was preventing them fromgoing into a recession, Yeutter replied that result was"certainly possible" and was the reason why they should adjusttheir monetary, fiscal and tax policies.    Asked by Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) whether the U.S. tradedeficit would improve more if the value of the dollar droppedfurther, Yeutter replied, "That should be a mathematical truism."But he added that markets are more complicated than that.    He said he expected the current decline in the dollar toshow up soon in the decline in the value of imports.    He expected the U.S. would soon start importing less fromJapan and Europe and would start exporting more to Europe wherethere's less rigidity on imports. Reuter

IMF, WORLD BANK TO MEET AMID NEW INFLATION FEARS Amid new concerns about inflation,interest rate increases and trade confrontations,finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discussa deteriorating global debt and economic situation.    The meetings, under the auspices of the InternationalMonetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates areturning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further,upsetting bond and stock markets.    Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the globaleconomy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continueto carry the burden of their growing debt without vast newassistance.    Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signsany new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury SecretaryJames Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works.    The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil,which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs ofcommercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded bylaying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans.    Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in avisit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out theadministration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses tothe very poorest states.    The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministersin detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly beembraced by the developing countries.    "There's interest on the part of some countries for lookingat the support of the special problems of the very poorestcountries, because their position is so extreme," a Reaganadministration official said.    He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue.    The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debtinitiative, which called for new funding to help debtorcountries grow out of their problems.    The largest industrial countries have been attempting tocoordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling thedecline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and otherproblems.    At the same time, the industrial countries see littleevidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fundforecasts they will grow 2.5 pct.    The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked otherindustrial countries to stimulate their economies.    These issues directly affect the debt problem and theability of the debtor countries to grow out of theirdifficulties.    In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports ofdeveloping country, allowing them to earn critical foreignexchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit,running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing othersto import more from developing countries.    The discussions, from April six to 10, will bewide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to theimpact of development loans on the environment, according tomonetary sources.    The talks will include an examination of tradeprotectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reaganadministration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs onmicrochip products from Japan, the sources said.    The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financialmarkets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing.    There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. chargesthat Japan has been selling computer chip products below fairmarket value and has kept its own market closed to imports,further undermining the international trading system.    At the same time, the ministers will discuss thefundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the exportmainstay of many developing countries.    The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- theUnited States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- willgather for the first time since their February talks in Paris,where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further.    The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada forfurther debate on economic policy coordination.    As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such asJapan agreed to stimulate their economies, while Americasaid it would reduce its federal budget deficit.    Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to tohave a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank, strengthening the link between loans andeconomic policy changes in debtor nations.    Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take moreaccount of the environment when making loan for dams and otherprojects.    The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said thisissue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganizationplan for the Bank, now being prepared. Reuter
U.S., JAPANESE OPEN TALKS ON SEMICONDUCTORS U.S. and Japanese officials meettomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor tradeand to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs PresidentReagan has ordered imposed on Japanese exports.    But U.S. officials held out little hope that any accordcould be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up fromabout five per cent - are to take effect on April 17.    The Customs Bureau last week started to levy a bond on theJapanese goods that Reagan ordered penalized. The penaltieswould be retroactive to March 31.

UK MINISTER LOOKS TO EASE TENSION WITH JAPAN The U.K. government hopes for abreakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policiesduring next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs MinisterMichael Howard, political sources said.    Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he willtry to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit.    Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from JapanesePrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help insolving the row over a U.K. firm's bid to win a significantrole in Japan's telecommunications market, government sourcessaid.    Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to armitself early with new statutory powers which it says could beused against certain Japanese financial institutions.    Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter fromNakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as asignal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactoryoutcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc,government officials said.    But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyothat Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more thanpoliteness in the face of British anger, they added. Reuter
CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD World Bank President Barber Conableexpressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of anew showdown between the United States and Japan, might spreadthroughout the industrial world.    But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the actionby the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronicgoods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for afull-scale trade war.    Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developingcountries to open their markets, arguing that a free tradingenvironment increased the possibility of global economicgrowth.    "We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to manycountries in the developing world which have encouraged theopening of their markets and we want to be sure that thedeveloped world doesn't close at the same time," he said.    He said the U.S. action against Japan was "a significantretaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change intrade policy."    The interview came just before next week's semi-annualmeetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.    Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium,Conable also said the global debt situation was very seriousand must be closely watched.    He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated onmaking loans that assist the basic underpinnings in thedeveloping world such as dams, roads and sewers, willincreasingly make assistance available for economic reform.    The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of thedebt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of newfunds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reformsaimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investmentand reducing government's role in the economy.    "We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect,however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,"Conable said.    He made clear, however, that adjustment lending wouldcontinue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lendingfor some time.    He noted, "the problem of debt was a severe one and manycountries are asking for adjustment assistance because of theproblem of debt."    Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New Yorkchosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. Heis an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launchedthe U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending bythe World Bank.    Conable also said that he expected the result of a majorstudy of the Bank's organization to be completed in the nextseveral weeks.    He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, inpart, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from thepoorest countries for not doing enough to help and from therichest countries because of inefficiency.    the reorganization is considered a major initiative byConable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151member-countries as an indication of his management style andpriorities.    "I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those whomust support it as soundly constituted so that it will bepermitted to grow," Conable said.    However, he said "I don't believe there is anythingbasically wrong with this institution and I don't believe ithas to have any redefinition of its purpose."    He said, however, that it was apparent that the debtinitiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central rolein dealing with the debt crisis.    Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and itssister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good andthat he talked often with IMF Managing Director MichelCamdessus on a variety of issues.    On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a needto put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that "I don't havea particular mission here except to be useful to theinstitution and to the process of development."    He added, "so I don't feel a great calling to personalizethe institution."    On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable saidthat the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assistingthe region, noting that half of the recently agreed financingof 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International DevelopmentAssociation was earmarked for Africa.    Leading industrial nations are expected to consider newforms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like thosein the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings. Reuter

BRITAIN WARNS JAPAN OVER TRADE ROW British corporate affairs minister MichaelHoward told Japan to resolve the row over the U.K. Firm Cableand Wireless Plc's <CAWL.L> shareholding in a new Japanesetelecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration intrade relations.    In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunicationsministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the wayTokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing tradeimbalance between the two countries.    "I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister thatI was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abruptdeterioration in the trading relations of our countries whichwould have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world,"Howard told reporters.    "He listened very carefully and I have little doubt themessage got home," he added.    British frustration over the lopsided trade balance -nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - hasreached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howardsaid.    Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable andWireless from having a major role in the internationaltelephone market in Japan.    "I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as Iwant a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in tradingrelations," Howard said. "We simply aren't prepared to continueto accept the imbalance which has been the position for such along time."    Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unableto comment on Howard's meeting with their minister.    But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign MinisterTadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan areincreasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade.    Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunicationsdispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied.    Howard told reporters that Britain was actively consideringpossible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on thetelecommunications issue.    "There are measures which are under consideration if wecontinue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,"he added, but gave no details.    He said he had received a reassuring response from theJapanese he has spoken with.    "But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanesefor quite some time," he added. "What I've made plain is weexpect to see action."    Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's FinancialServices bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices.Those powers, which allow London to ban foreign financial firmslike banks from Britain, are designed to ensure U.K. Firmsequal access to overseas financial markets.

U.S. CALLS FOR GREATER GATT CHECKS ON TRADE The United States has appealed forstronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) to enforce world trade rules.    The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smithat a special committee meeting into the future of GATT followsa series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts bythe 93-nation body to promote fair trade.    Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade roundlaunched by ministers last September. The round, which covers13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods andservices will take four years to negotiate.    Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financialinstitutions such as the International Monetary Fund and WorldBank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers toensure the success of the Uruguay Round.    "The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened toassure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of theworld trading system and the global economy," Smith said.    "Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak,or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy."    He also also urged that member states be accountable toeach other for their trade policies.    Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with EuropeanCommunity (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted tostress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics.    "We are interested in more periodic ministerialinvolvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings," he said.    GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord onsemiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT traderules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanesechips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT disputepanel be set up to review the agreement.    President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay traderound to promote freer trade, has said Washington will imposetariffs against Japanese electronic goods.    He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its marketsto U.S. Exports. REUTER
VOLCKER URGES QUICK AID TO DEBTOR NATIONS Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said that debtor nations have made much progress inlaying the groundwork for economic growth, but a solution toworld debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on newfinancing.    "There is clearly a danger that adequate financingarrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in atimely way," Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee.    The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed withconfidence that the necessary funds will be available to them,he said.    Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading worldeconomic power, but it is in a difficult position today,Volcker said.    He said it will take a concerted effort to regularizeBrazil's external payments.    "The key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of Brazilianauthorities," he said.    Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive towork together, Volcker said.    Regarding trade imbalances, Volcker said that it wascritically important that markets be kept open by theindustrial nations.    In addition, the United States must reduce its budgetdeficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to theirdomestic economies, Volcker said.    "We need time for those actions and the earlierdepreciation to work their effects," he said. Reuter

JAPAN CUTS CHIP SUPPLY, MAY PRODUCE SHORTAGE Japan is attempting to cut backsemiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S.tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April17, industry analysts said.    The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and apossible shortage of the key computer components in the nextfew weeks, the analysts said.    "Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay ofthe Japanese semiconductor industry," analyst Drew Peck ofDonaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said.    But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far,and some questioned whether Japan would be successful inforcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run.    Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence wasalready in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and haltedsales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sellchips at below production costs.    "We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, andit has virtually dried up for EPROMS," said Merrill Lynchanalyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used incomputers.    "Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries arestretching," Kurlack added.    Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of InternationalTrade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs inproduction to meet the terms of last year's semiconductoraccord with the U.S.    The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs onJapanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed tolive up to the accord and continued to dump the computercomponents in the U.S. market.    But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S.was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form oftrade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S.    As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, priceswill rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductormanufactures will be able to take up the slack since most longago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makersthat use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.    "The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce tradepressures from Washington, but at the same time they'redemonstating their muscle," analyst Peck said.    The cut backs in Japanese production are expected tobenefit U.S. chip makers.    "I think this could be a very important factor for U.S.semiconductor manufacturers," industry analyst Elliot Levine ofLadenburg Thalmann Co said.    But analyst Peck said, "it will take a few weeks to seewhether Japan has genuinely cut production."    He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI'srequest unfavorably because chip capacity was still high andproduction cut backs would lead to significant write-offs inplant and equipment.

U.S. URGES SURPLUS NATIONS TO BOOST GROWTH Leading industrial nations will bereviewing the Paris agreement to stabilize exchange rates,foster increased worldwide growth and reduce trade imbalancesbut the U.S. thinks the accord has been successful so far, asenior U.S. Treasury official said.    "The Paris accord will be reviewed at this meeting. It hasbeen successful and continues to be succesfull," a senior U.S.Treasury official told reporters.    In a briefing ahead of this week's semiannual IMF and WorldBank meetings, he also said the U.S. was looking to WestGermany and Japan to bolster their economic growth.    The official said both surplus countries, like West Germanyand Japan, and deficit countries, like the U.S., agreed to playa role in bringing about more balanced economic growth.    He reaffirmed the U.S. would press ahead with efforts toreduce its budget deficit, resist protectionism and boost U.S.competitiveness.    The official also said that he expected trade issues, likethe dispute between the U.S. and Japan over microchips, to beincluded in the discussions.    The official made no direct comment on the content orschedule of forthcoming Group of Five and Group of Sevendiscussions. He said that industrial countries are concernedthat the large external imbalances remain a threat to theinternational monetary system.    He added that the meetings will also provide an opportunityto discuss economic policy coordination efforts.    The official said indicators would be used to measurepolicy objectives of industrial countries and their economicprojections.    They would also be used to assess progress of policy goals.    Asked whether the U.S. was proposing a new initiativeregarding the indicators, the official said the issue would bereported to the Venice Summit in June.

CANADIANS URGE EXEMPTION FROM U.S. TRADE BILL A group of Canadian lawmakers fromOntario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canadafrom the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a majortrade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress.    At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, anorganization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of theOntario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, saidthe exemption would help trade relations.    The trade legislation to be considered by the full House inlate April would require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions wouldharm the U.S. economy.    Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on anygrounds.    Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S.congressmen, "I can understand (the trade bill). I think it hasto do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world."    "I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. Youdo not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerelyconsider exempting our country from that bill," he added.    Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, withtwo-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according tothe coalition. But the U.S. ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit inmanufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlrsurplus in services trade with its neighbour. Reuter
ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT Mounting trade friction between theU.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exportingnations that the row could inflict far-reaching economicdamage, businessmen and officials said.    They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in theU.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.    But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurtthem in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might betheir gain.    The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs onimports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, inretaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact notto sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.    Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffsat 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firmssaid they would virtually halt exports of products hit by thenew taxes.    "We wouldn't be able to do business," said a spokesman forleading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co Ltd <MC.T>.    "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of timebeyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion ofexports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.," said TomMurtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker <JamesCapel and Co>.    In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.    "We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat againstJapan because it serves as a warning to us," said a seniorTaiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.    Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs lastyear, 95 pct of it with the U.S.    The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reservesto 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.    "We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers andcut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if wewant to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation," saidPaul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters <Taiwan Safe Group>.    A senior official of South Korea's trade promotionassociation said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japanmight also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exportsare similar to those of Japan.    Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billiondlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.    In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said toughcurbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers ofsemiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to theU.S.    In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has beenselling below-cost semiconductors, some electronicsmanufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said sucha short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed byfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports.    "That is a very short-term view," said Lawrence Mills,director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.    "If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it willbe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kongis the disadvantage of action restraining trade," he said.    The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.    The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of tradetalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.    "This kind of deterioration in trade relations between twocountries which are major trading partners of ours is a veryserious matter," Button said.    He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significantU.S. Exports to that country.    Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve thetrade stand-off continue.    Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlineda package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.    The measures proposed include a large supplementary budgetand record public works spending in the first half of thefinancial year.

JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS Senior Japanese officials tomorrowopen talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditcheffort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a widevariety of Japanese electronic exports.    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days ofmeetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, MichaelSmith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.    The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are inretaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement toend dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost andto open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.    They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,including television and audio equipment and computers.    Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was littlelikelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pctduties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.    President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials thatJapan was not honoring the agreement.    In making the annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed tothe full enforcement of our trade agreements designed toprovide American industry with free and fair trade."    Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan'ssemiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injuredthe U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which hascomplained about presidential timidity on trade issues.    Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressivetrade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan'sinaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which lastyear reached 169.8 billion dlrs.    About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.    Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning toadhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.    Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposalsbut did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.    He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan'sdecision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated senseof MITI's power to control Japanese traders.

DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT Financial analysts say they arepleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federalbudget deficit but believe the actions will do little to helpimprove the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.    The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrowto approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the comingfiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.    Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a planthat would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs nextyear.        "In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs isinfinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have littleimpact on the economy and the trade deficit," said StanleyCollander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.    "At best, it will have a small positive effect," Collandersaid in an interview.    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedlytold Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long wayto help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help easesome of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.    The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the tradeimbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volckerhas warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraughtwith danger.    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation asimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreigncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with othermajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value ofthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange ratesshould be stabilized at around current levels.    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed totake steps to stimulate their economies and the United Statesagreed to cut its budget deficit.    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as away to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, isto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.    "If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything elseyou do is going to be counterproductive," Volcker said in recenttestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten thegovernment's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the creditsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures orto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the UnitedStates.    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off thecurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressedthat any deficit reduction was better than none.    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility itneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollarfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.    "There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but ifyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve theFed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answeris, it's not enough," Silvia told Reuters.    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government'smost vexing and persistent problems.    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yetlittle indication that this year's figure will be any lower,though administration officials have predicted it will drop byabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleepworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from thefederal budget.    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is notattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set forthe 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balancedbudget law.    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs fornext year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate BudgetCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fallshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.    "For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about themost you're going to get" out of Congress at the present time,said Touche Ross's Collander. "To do something more than thatwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end upshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.    "To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptablereduction level," he explained. "Anything less than that will nowlook like a failure to Wall Street."    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor wouldlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the yearbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cuttingdefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from theiranticipated spending levels for next year.    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit ofnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts. Reuter

EC LAUNCHES ANTI-DUMPING PROBE ON JAPANESE CHIPS The European Community launched aninvestigation into allegations of dumping by Japanesesemiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could markan intensification of world trade strains.    Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washingtonfor the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips itimports into the U.S.    The EC Executive Commission said today the EuropeanElectrical Component Manufacturers Association complained thatJapanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasableprogrammable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.    Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROMmarket, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had beenforced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct inorder to compete with the Japanese.    The Commission said it believed the Association had givensufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant aninvestigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it foundthe complaints were justified.    The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S.And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privilegedaccess to the Japanese market. REUTER

CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY Canada's trade picture has brightenedconsiderably, underscoring economists' predictions the sectorwould post a long awaited recovery this year.    The federal government reported today that the monthlysurplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher thanFebruary 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.    "Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said RichardsonGreenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.    Economists generally don't expect such large gains over thenext months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout theyear.    "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over theyear, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure isindicative of that," commented economist James Donegan at theToronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.    Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billiondls in the month.    "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value ofexports up by 5.9 pct in February," the agency said in itsmonthly report.    Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billiondlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.    Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would endup three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billiondlrs.    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touchedoff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning afterclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in earlyafternoon trading.    Economists have been banking on an improved tradeperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggishCanadian economy.    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touchedoff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning afterclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in earlyafternoon trading.    Economists have been banking on an improved tradeperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggishCanadian economy.    They say the country's consumers, who have been spending ata torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlaysthis year and this should help curtail the flow of imports intothe country.    Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the UnitedStates, by far the country's largest market, is expected to bestrong as a result of a projected rise in American consumerspending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.    "We maintain what's going to drive Canada's exportperformance is income growth in the U.S.," said Midland'sDonegan.    But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economistWarren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook andsaid it could be a mistake to read too much into February'strade upturn.    Jestin said, "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showingsigns of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicatethat part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) isprobably transitory."

JAPAN WARNS U.S. IT MAY RETALIATE IN TRADE DISPUTE Japan warned the United States it maytake retaliatory measures if the United States imposes itsplanned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior governmentofficial said.    Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Tradeand Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would considermeasures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade andother actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs onsome Japanese exports as planned next week.    However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue tradetalks with the United States despite its failure to convinceAmerica to call off the threatened tariffs during two days ofemergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.    Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions inretaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in marketsoutside the United States and to open its home market toAmerican goods.    Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably notlistened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up thepact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanationof why it planned to impose the tariffs.

TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS Taiwan announced plans for another roundof import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before tradetalks with Washington which officials described as a move tohelp balance trade with the United States.    Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry'sCustoms Administration Department, told reporters the list ofproducts included 60 items asked by Washington.    "The move is part of our government efforts to encourageimports from our trading partners, particularly from the UnitedStates," he said.    He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinetthat the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cutby between five and 50 pct.    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursdayand the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly startingon April 20, he added.    Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce itsgrowing trade surplus with the United States, the island'slargest trading partner.    Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts andpressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge tradedeficit with Taipei.    Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. Itwidened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.    Today's announcement came before a departure later today ofa 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series oftrade talks with U.S. Officials.    The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters lastnight he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he wouldface tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionistsentiments in the U.S. Congress.

BRITISH MINISTER SAYS HE WARNED TOKYO OF SANCTIONS A British minister said he had given theJapanese government a clear warning of sanctions againstJapanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to itsinternal markets "and it was clearly understood."    Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on hisreturn from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese werebeginning to appreciate the need to be "fair and open" aboutaccess to their own markets.    At an airport news conference Howard denied oppositioncharges that his trip had been a failure because he hadreturned empty-handed.    "I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clearmessage to the Japanese government, and I delivered it veryclearly, and it has been clearly understood."    Howard said that under the Financial Services Act thegovenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctionsagainst Japanese companies and finance houses operating inBritain.    "It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusingoperating licences. We can ban firms from certain countriesfrom carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowingthem to carry out other kinds."    "I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made itclear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall usethem."    He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan becameinvolved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gainedmore than anyone else from an open trading relationship.    "I think they are beginning to appreciate that if thisrelationship is to continue, it is very important for them tobe fair and open about access to their own markets."    On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc<CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share oftelecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had toldthe Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.    He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable andWireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday,he said.    Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatchersaid Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan,but would have to coordinate action with its European Communitypartners.

TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN Member states of the EuropeanCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan whichthey believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to openits market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ECcountries bear witness to a new disillusionment with thewillingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanesegovernment to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, asEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction toan EC executive commission proposal under which the EC couldraise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligationsentered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designedto stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that ofthe U.S.    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC'strade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs inMarch, up from 1.94 billion in February.    In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billiondlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell onepct to 12.43 billion dlrs.    In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France hasdecided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.    Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozenCoquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict applicationof French quality standards -- something EC states say oftenhappens to their own exports entering Japan.    Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanesebanks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out incompetition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.    However, British officials in London have said that thegovernment may have gone too far in implying that it would takeimmediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.    By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successfuleconomy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferringto rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its ownindustries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.    The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recentyears, substituting general calls for action by Japan to openits market with specific demands for moves in key areas.    At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to endallegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines andspirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contractsfor the building of a new international airport, and tosimplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.    EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, butoften the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariffbarriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.    They stress, however, that any action must be taken by theEC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.    One of the problems Britain could face if it were towithdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankerswould be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,they point out. REUTER

EC COULD DECIDE ON JAPAN TRADE MOVES IN LATE MAY The European Community (EC) haseffectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open itsmarket to imports before it decides on possible toughretaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.    They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.    The EC executive commission was asked by representatives ofmember states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some ECpledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market."    Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposingstiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japaneseexports.    The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would bediscussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministerson April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepareproposals for possible retaliatory action.    They said the commission has powers to take some limitedaction before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japaneseexports of electrical, photographic and other goods beingdiverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.    In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how toprevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as aresult of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obligesthem gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.

JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS Basic reform of Japan's protected farmsector is a key to shifting its economy away from export todomestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its tradesurplus, securities analysts said.

Reducing these prices could increase household spendingpower by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent onproducts which would have a more direct impact in boostingdomestic growth, it added.    "There's a lot of slack," a U.S. Government official in Tokyosaid. "All that money could be spent on something else."    Direct central government subsidies to the farm sectoramount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independentestimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.    Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farmon weekends to put their land up for sale for residentialdevelopment would also give a boost to domestic spending,economists said.    "Housing construction is the key strategic variable in theexpansion of domestic demand," wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professorat Kyoto Gakuen University.    Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reformto shift some of the burden of trade friction and economicrestructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto thefarm sector. Employers groups also want change. "If you reallywant to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not toraise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices," BumpeiOtsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'Associations told a recent press conference.    External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seekremoval of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their tradedeficits with Japan.    But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain wellentrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.    Although the full-time farm population is falling and thereare signs the LDP is paying more attention to urbanconstituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent onfarm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth severalcity votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.    The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reformplan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,the analysts said.    Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept thetraditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay fornational food security, they said.    Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed toimport liberalisation, but are more flexible about reformsaimed at stepping up productivity, they said.    Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specificpressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew. REUTER
JAPAN DETAILS PLAN TO STAVE OFF TRADE PROBLEMS Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and anincrease in government purchases of foreign goods, the head ofthe committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.    The plan will also urge the government to double 1985'sofficial development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within fiveyears instead of seven as the government had promised, seniorLDP officials said at a press conference.    LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explainthe plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.    Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.    Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of thetax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abewill be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.    The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods bythe government will probably include the purchase of supercomputers, LDP officials said.    According to the plan, Japan will also strive to solvespecific trade problems with other nations and will encourageflows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.    The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy andlessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.    The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to andwelcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrialnations in Washington last week, they said.    The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of severalpackages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will beunveiled by the government in late May. REUTER

REAGAN TO ANNOUNCE DECISION ON JAPAN SANCTIONS President Reagan today is toannounce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports toretaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfairpractices in semiconductor trade.    The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs ofJapanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel ofexperts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.    Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffson certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computorsand television sets to power tools and photographic film.    The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to SantaBarbara, where Reagan is vacationing.    In his March annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed tofull enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provideAmerican industry with free and fair trade opportunities."    He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored thepact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in worldmarkets and opened its home market to U.S. products.    U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the Marchannouncement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  "wedo not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind ofaction that requires meaningful action."    Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.    About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.    Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president toretaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.    He has opposed the legislation, saying it would preventnegotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, thatexisting law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.    Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese wasas much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did notneed any new trade legislation.    The Japanese have complained that they have been honoringthe semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before theresults showed up.    U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring ofJapanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries andWestern Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that theJapanese home markets remained shut to American exports.    Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it wouldfile a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade(GATT).    It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation hadviolated the regulations of the global trading group and wouldapprove compensation or Japanese retaliation.    U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan wouldretaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war withthe United States. Reuter
YEUTTER SAYS JAPANESE CURB ALL BUT CERTAIN U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would goahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.    Asked in a television interview what the chance was forReagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japaneseelectronic exports, he said "slim to none."    Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs toretaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to enddumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less thancost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.    Yeutter, on the NBC program "Today," said the United Statesdid not want to terminate the agreement and would dropthe tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.    He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officialsthey were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would taketime to monitor any compliance.    Asked how long that would take, he said "We want to see apattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that wouldtake a few weeks."    Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumerimpact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goodsbecause the items selected are also readily available fromother countries and manufacturers.    He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.    "It seems to me it is not in the interests of either countryto get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand thatfull well," Yeutter said.    He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but "that's more of apaper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see anyadverse impact on U.S. trade."    Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductorissue could be resolved before or during a Washington visitlater this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.    He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as amajor issue, would be productive but "I don't see any practicalway to resolve this particular dispute before or during hisvisit." reuter
U.S. COMMERCE TRADE REPORT OMITS FREIGHT COSTS The Commerce Department said on thatinsurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billiondlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.    The department is required by law to wait 48 hours afterthe initial trade report to issue a second report on a "customsvalue" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurancecharges from the cost of imports.    Private-sector economists emphasized that the CommerceDepartment was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billiondlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.    A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in theforeign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealerssaid, that the underlying trade deficit for February had beenrevised downward.    The Commerce department would like to have the law changedto permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.    "My feeling is the second one is a better report but there'slegislation that requires us to delay it two days," said RobertOrtner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.    "But this has been going on for a long time and no one paysany attention to the second figure."    The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with arevised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.    The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthlytrade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in1979.    Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includescustoms, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparisonwith other countries that reported their trade balances on thesame basis.    The second figure, which would always be lower by deductingfreight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorablelight for the Reagan administration.    Ortner said he would like to see the law changed toeliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.    "We're considering it," he said, "It's one of those dinosaurlaws and I think it's time has come."    The second figure, which would always be lower by deductingfreight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorablelight for the Reagan administration.    Ortner said he would like to see the law changed toeliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.    "We're considering it," he said, "It's one of those dinosaurlaws and I think its time has come." Reuter
JAPANESE TARIFFS SEEN AS WORLDWIDE WARNING The tough trade sanctions PresidentReagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot acrossJapan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair tradepractices worldwide, U.S. officials said.    But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at BrookingsInstitution, a think tank, said "a shot across their bow canoften result in a shot in our stern."    He said it left the United States open to retaliation.    The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan orderedon 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congressthat a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,and no new protectionist legislation is needed.    In the past year tough trade action had been taken againstthe European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beerand wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters thetariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a "serious signal"to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.    Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honoran agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets atless than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. Thetariffs were placed on items which were available from othersources so there would be little effect on the Americanconsumer, Fitzwater said.    Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action- especially against Japan - to end global unfair tradepractices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.    The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.    The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billiondlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for aboutone-third of America's overall deficit.    But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, WestGermany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said thepresident is ready to fight them all.    Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that "I regretthat these actions are necessary," but that the health andvitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential toAmerican competitiveness in world markets.    "We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair tradingpractices," Reagan added in the statement from his Californiavacation home at Santa Barbara.    He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japanabided by the agreement.    U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that healready has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.    The White House aide said of the tariff action, "it wasn'tdone to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair tradepractice."    The aide added, however, "on another plane, it was anexample of how the administration uses the trade law to fightunfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a majoroverall of our trade laws."    But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was notin the best interests of the United States, and thatnegotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.    "It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route," hesaid, "because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions intrade."    Crandall said, "the administration is doing this for itspolitical impact across the country, and therefore its impacton Congress."    He said, "I don't think it makes a lot of sense."    But other analysts said it made little difference whetherthe tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,and that the main point was that the trading partners were onnotice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.    Spokesman Fitzwater said "we don't want a trade war," but theimposition of sanctions showed the United States would act whenit had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

"I'd say it's 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) willnot provoke a retaliation on American products," Yeutter toldCable News Network.    "Japan has far too much at stake in this relationship (withthe United States) to seriously entertain thoughts ofretaliation," Yeutter said.    Earlier today, Reagan imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range ofJapanese goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation ofa bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade.    Yeutter did say that U.S. farm products would be targetedif Tokyo decided to hit back.

BALDRIGE PRAISES NEW SOUTH KOREAN TRADE POLICIES U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigepraised South Korea's new surplus-cutting trade policies butwarned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul's marketliberalisation efforts falter or fail.    In a press conference after talks with South Koreanleaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intentionto regulate exports and boost imports "a very, very importantstep, the right direction for the Korean government to take."    The government adopted the new policies last week in thehope of heading off a trade war with the U.S.    Baldrige said the policies "showed an understanding of thefact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing byexports alone."    "There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growthbegins to take more of the load," he said.    South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus withWashington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars andconsumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billiondlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year.    Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was "broad enoughand comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken forliberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, ifthe government is willing to follow through."    "We will be watching the implementation of this new policydirection very closely," he said. "Because of the protectionismgrowing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does notkeep on the same path ... Of steadily increasingliberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turnbackward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd seeprotectionist movement in the U.S."    Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister RhaWoong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specificproduct categories.    These included service industries, which he said were stilltoo much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers andcars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing thetariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make themsell for up to three times their American prices.    "We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there'sgoing to be trouble somewhere down the road," he said. "We arejust pointing this out."    Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without arevaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging formonths, Baldrige declined to comment. "We don't have any targetfor any particular currency, but we do feel that currenciesaround the world, if we are going to be successful as a worldeconomy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the variouseconomies involved," he said.    Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal forcooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures inthird countries. The American government would be pleased toencourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added.    Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increasetariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige saidWashington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable toits difficulties with South Korea.    "I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,"he said. "It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything fornothing or just by asking for it.    "But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and theyusually end up with something good happening at the end thatboth countries live up to." REUTER
SOUTH KOREA CUTS EXPORT FINANCE LOANS South Korea has cut loans to exportingcompanies to help reduce the growing trade surplus with theUnited States and the European Community, finance ministryofficials said.

BRITAIN CALLS FOR FIGHT AGAINST PROTECTIONISM British Foreign Secretary Sir GeoffreyHowe called on industrial and developing countries to combattrade protectionism and remove barriers which impede freetrading in agricultural products.    Howe said in an address to the annual meeting of the U.N.Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)that success in fighting protectionism hinges on the currentUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    He said Britain is committed to resisting and combattingprotectionism because free trade is vital to Britain where 30pct of the gnp comes from trade in goods and services.    Howe urged developing countries to open up their markets,remove measures distorting free trade in services and provideprotection for intellectual property rights.    He said industrial nations should also adopt macro-economicpolicies which help reduce trade imbalances and promote stablecurrency relationships.    Howe said the agricultural industry, plagued by surplusesand falling commodity prices in recent years, is oversubsidised and over protected. But the problem of farmsurpluses must be tackled despite the fact that it ispolitically difficult for any government to reverse the trendof growing farm subsidies.    "This problem of over-subsidisation and over-protection ofagriculture will dog us in the years ahead and it will need thesustained application of all our energy and our imagination tofind solutions," Howe said.

TAIWAN PROPOSES TO INVEST ONE BILLION DLRS IN U.S. Taiwan's Economic Ministry has approvedan ambitious proposal calling for a one billion U.S. Dollarinvestment by private and public companies in the United Statesover the next five years, ministry officials said.    John Ni, director of the Ministry's Industrial Developmentand Investment Centre (IDIC), said under the IDIC proposal,Taiwanese firms would be encouraged to set up factories andinvest in property and securities markets in the U.S..    Taiwan's 1986 investment in the U.S. Totalled 46 mln U.S.Dlrs, official statistics show.    The investment was mainly in the electronics, food, serviceand trading sectors.    The new proposal, approved by Economic Minister Lee Ta-haiyesterday, calls for investment of 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in 1987,120 mln in 1988, 160 mln in 1989, 240 mln in 1990 and 400 mlnin 1991, he told Reuters.    It will be discussed soon by officials of the FinanceMinistry, the Central Bank and the Council for EconomicPlanning and Development before being submitted to the cabinetfor final approval, he said.    "This is the first ambitious proposal with governmentinitiatives to encourage our businessmen to invest in America,"Lee said.    He said government incentives to prospective Taiwaneseinvestors would include bank loans and a five-year income taxholiday. Applications for investing in the U.S. Would also besimplified.    A ministry spokesman told reporters the proposed investmentwould be helpful in creating job opportunities for Americansand avoiding U.S. Import quotas or restrictions on Taiwaneseproducts.    The plan will also help reduce Taiwan's trade surplus withthe U.S., Which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in1986, up from 10.2 billion in 1985, the spokesman said.    The rising surplus has enabled Taiwan to accumulate some 54billion U.S. Dlrs in foreign exchange reserves.    Economists described the proposal as a significant step bythe government to head off U.S. Protectionism.    "Time is running out for us. Taiwan has lagged far behindJapan and South Korea in encouraging its businessmen to investabroad," said Hou Chia-chi, economics professor at SoochowUniversity. REUTER
BALDRIGE ASSURES CHINA ON TRADE AND TECHNOLOGY U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigesaid U.S. Sales of high technology to China are rising despitePeking's complaints they are being restricted.    He told reporters at the airport on arriving here for talksthat technology transfers to China had increased every year andwould continue to do so.    The official Peking Review yesterday accused the UnitedStates of delaying approval on high-technology sales to China.    Last year, Washington approved only 60 pct of the exportsChina applied for, the magazine said.    "The COCOM-listed kind of export controls are just afraction of the technology that the U.S. Is transferring (toChina) by other means, such as joint ventures," Baldrige said.    COCOM is the Western coordinating committee formed afterWorld War Two to limit the export of advanced technology toCommunist nations.    Baldrige said he was sure U.S. Firms could compete againstfirms from other countries for high technology sales.    He added that protectionism would hurt the economies oftrading nations and said the Reagan Administration would fightprotectionist legislation in the U.S. Congress.    Baldrige and China's Foreign Trade Minister Zheng Tuobinwill act as chairmen of the fifth session of a commission oncommerce and trade that will review bilateral trade relations.    A U.S. Official said other issues to be raised duringBaldrige's talks are trade deficits, which each country says ithas with the other, and the problems facing U.S. Companiesinvesting in China.

"The need to accelerate the efforts(to restructure the economy) is well recognized."    Hirabayashi said that gradual progress had been made torefocus the Japanese economy, but admitted that it might notseem all that spectacular to foreign observers.    Difficulties had been encountered in implementing theso-called Maekawa report since it was unveiled a year ago, hesaid. But, he added, foreign governments should appreciate theefforts that have been made.    The report, named for its principal author, former Bank ofJapan governor Haruo Maekawa, called for a shift in Japan'seconomy away from its dependence on exports for growth. TheJapanese cabinet today reviewed progress made since itsrelease.    According to Hirabayashi, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasonetold his fellow ministers that Japan must follow the directionset out by Maekawa and urged them to make efforts to achieveit.    Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari added that not enough hadbeen done to publicize the action Japan was taking to refocusits economy.    Listing some of those actions, Hirabayashi said imports ofmanufactured goods have increased, interest rates have fallen,and coal, steel and non-ferrous metal output have been reduced.    He expressed hope that Japan will act more quickly in thefuture to implement the report and scoffed at a suggestion thatit would take ten years for Maekawa's goals to be met.    "It will not take very much time to fulfill the (goals) setout by the Maekawa report," he said. REUTER
SENATE PREPARING FOR NEW U.S. BUDGET BATTLE Congress returned from its Easterrecess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promisesto be a partisan dispute.    The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reaganand Republicans is expected to get underway this week in theSenate late this week and last at least another week. It istaking on new prominence because of current trade woes.    That is because the budget problems and its associated hugedeficits are said to be at the root of related internationaltrade friction currently worrying financiers.    As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stockexchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the UnitedStates and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major tradewar between the two trading giants for the first time sinceWorld War II.    Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan isrefusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and theresulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisionsand small computers.    Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neitherside wants, is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit.    Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up tothe economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue togrow without repercussions.    A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed byforeigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if theywithdraw this support the result can only be further problems,including higher interest rates for Americans.    In a nutshell, the U.S. budget process has now moved to theshowdown stages in Congress. Reagan's own trillion dollarspending budget for the government year 1988, starting Oct. 1,was trounced badly in the House on April 9.    The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed theHouse, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171billion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs, throughdefense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrsin new, unspecified, taxes. As the Senate prepares to take upits own budget plan, majority Democrats predict there will bepassage of a bill, only after a protracted partisan battle.    In the House, not one Republican voted for the budget,which passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate, none of Reagan'sRepublicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the SenateBudget Committee for full Senate consideration.    A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters hebelieves this very unusual unanimous opposition was by designamong congressional Republicans, perhaps with the tacitapproval of the White House.    "Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any taxhikes and defense cuts," he said.    In the coming weeks, the source said, Democrats will pressfor a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget withReagan -- who already is opposed to the idea. But "it is notclear how the Republicans will act," he added.    He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lowertaxes and more defense spending, which they did not offer afterReagan's budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House.     When Reagan entered the White House in 1981, he inheritedwhat was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that woundup to be nearly 79 billion dlrs that year.    Despite Reagan's promise to balance the budget by 1983,critics note that his administration's record of accumulateddebt is estimated over one trillion dlrs, or 1,100 billiondlrs.    That is money the government must borrow, and pay back, andmany analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and causedthe worst U.S. trade deficit ever.     Last year the United States bought goods from the worldworth 169.8 billion dlrs more than what it sold, includingpurchases of 58.6 billion dlrs in Japanese goods.    While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on onefront through a get-tough trade bill promising retaliatorymeasures unless all markets are opened, its success so faragainst the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress.    Congress, which controls the pursestrings, has put thedeficit on a downward path from its record high of 220.7billion dlrs accumulated in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30.    Because of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget lawenacted in late 1985, there has been pressure on Congress to domore than talk about deficits.    That law, named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm ofTexas, Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat ErnestHollings of South Carolina, calls for a balanced budget by 1991through a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet.    The law has been followed, even though an enforcementmechanism to mandate automatic across-the-board cuts ifCongress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court.    The legislators have followed the targets -- on paper. Butin reality, the goal has actually been missed. For example,Congress last year approved legislation to meet the 1987 targetof a 144 billion dlr deficit. But even after approving thenumbers, the deficit for 1987 is estimated at over 170 billiondlrs -- far off the target.    This year the target is 108 billion dlrs and that goal isexpected to be missed widely. Reuter
TAIWAN WINS REVISED TEXTILE ACCORD FROM U.S. Taiwan and the U.S. Have revised andextended their textile export agreement after negotiations inWashington this week, a spokesman for the Taiwan TextileFederation said.    Charles Chen told Reuters the original three year accordhas been extended by one year to the end of 1989. The U.S. Hasagreed to raise the limit on annual growth of Taiwan's textileand apparel exports to one pct from 0.5 pct for calendar 1989,he said. "The new accord is more fair and gives breathing spaceto our textile makers (so they can) diversify their exports toother nations," he added.    Chen said the revised agreement puts Taiwan on similartextile exporting terms to Hong Kong and South Korea. Butdespite the changes, Taiwanese firms have lost orders to rivalsin Hong Kong and South Korea because of the strong Taiwandollar, he said. The Taiwan currency has risen 17 pct againstthe U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the Korean won roseby some six pct and the Hong Kong dollar was stable.    Taiwan's textile exports to the U.S. Amounted to 2.8billion U.S. Dlrs last year out of total exports to the U.S. Of7.8 billion. Textile exports are expected to remain the samethis year, Chen said.

JAPAN RULING PARTY PREPARES FINAL ECONOMIC PACKAGE Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party(LDP) drew up a final plan to expand domestic demand and boostimports in time for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's visit toWashington next week, LDP officials said.    The plan calls for additional fiscal measures worth morethan 5,000 billion yen, a large-scale supplementary budget forthe current fiscal year started April 1, and concentration ofmore than 80 pct of the annual public works budget in the firsthalf of the year, they said.    Nakasone will explain the measures to U.S. Officials duringhis visit to Washington starting April 29.    The LDP plan will be the basis for a government package ofpump-priming measures expected to be unveiled in late May.    The LDP said Japan should do more to reduce its tradesurplus. Its plan is expected to help increase economic growthled by domestic demand, officials said.    The government was also urged to review the ceiling onbudgetary requests for investment purposes in 1988/89. Thegovernment has imposed a five pct cut in investment outlays inthe past five years in line with Nakasone's avowed policy offiscal reforms.    The plan called on Japan to promote government purchases offoreign goods and private sector imports of manufactured goodsby improving import financing, and to make clear officialprocurement procedures for foreign supercomputers.    The LDP also said Japan should contribute further tosociety at large through measures such as doubling its officialdevelopment assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs in five years or soinstead of seven years as the government had originallypromised.    The government was urged to work out a program to recyclefunds from Japan's trade surpluses to debt-ridden countries.    The officials said the funds to be recycled would includethose from the private sector and others provided through thegovernment Export-Import Bank of Japan and Japan's OverseasEconomic Cooperation Fund.    The plan also calls for the government to take steps tohelp the development of African and other less developednations.    The LDP called for adequate and flexible management ofmonetary policy, such as a cut in interest rates on depositswith the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund, and a tax cut topromote plant and equipment investment.

U.S., JAPAN TRADE TIES REMAIN HOSTILE The visit this week by a specialJapanese envoy has done little to defuse Japan's tradefrictions with the United States, U.S. and congressionalleaders say.    White House and congressional leaders took a wait-and-seestance, after a series of meetings with former Japanese ForeignMinister Shintaro Abe, who was here paving the way for theApril 29-May 2 visit of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.    They are withholding judgment until Nakasone's visit, withone senator saying Japan had promised to stimulate its economyand open its markets to foreign goods in the past, but it wastime now for action.    The U.S. trade deficit last year was a record 169.8 billiondlrs, with more than one-third of it in trade with Japan.    Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to tryto turn around the deficit, which has cost millions of U.S.jobs and closed thousands of factories.    Much of the anger has been directed at Japan.    U.S.-Japan trade friction was further fueled by PresidentReagan's April 17 decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300 mlndlrs worth of Japanese goods in retaliation for unfairpractices in semiconductor trade.    Reagan said he imposed the tariffs on personal computers,television sets and hand tools because Japan failed to keep anagreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets atless than cost and to open its home market to U.S. products.     Abe had asked Reagan to end the tariffs quickly, but U.S.officials said the curbs would not be dropped until Japan hadshown it was honoring the pact, which could take severalmonths.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked if Nakasone'svisit might help to defuse trade tensions, said "whetherprogress can be made depends on how you want to measure it."    He added, "I would expect progress to be made. If you wantto measure that in terms of lifting the sanctions, that's moredoubtful."    Congressmen were equally skeptical.    Abe met Senate and Democratic leaders active in tradelegislation, telling them of Japan's plan to spur domesticspending by 34 billion dlrs and open its markets to a widerange of goods, including supercomputers and farm products.    Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, said after themeeting, "We have heard promises in the past, but the questionnow is whether there will be real action."    Abe also met House leaders pressing for a tough trade bill,including Congressman Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat.    Gephardt is sponsoring legislation to penalize nations withlarge deficits and which are guilty of unfair trade practices.    Gephardt's legislation would hit Japan, as well as Taiwan,South Korea, and West Germany. The bill is expected to pass theHouse next week - coinciding with Nakasone's visit - but itsfate in the more moderate Senate is uncertain. A bipartisangroup of senators, however, told Nakasone in a letter releasedas Abe was holding Senate meetings, that fresh Japanese-U.S.trade strife would erupt if Japan's markets were not soonopened to American goods.    The signers included Democratic leader Robert Byrd of WestVirginia, Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas and othersranging from moderate to hardline on trade issues.    They said in the letter there was growing U.S. sentimentthat Japan was fighting opening its markets and "evidence to thecontrary is necessary to combat this perception, or it islikley that additional efforts will be attempted to close offthe American market to Japanese goods.

CHINA TEXTILE EXPORTS RECORD HIGH IN 1ST QUARTER China's textile exports in the firstquarter reached a record 2.2 billion dlrs, an increase of 49pct on the year-earlier period, the People's Daily said.    Its overseas edition gave no country breakdown. The U.S. Isone of China's largest markets for textiles.    U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige told a pressconference that Chinese textile and apparel exports to the U.S.In 1986 rose 65 pct in value from the 1985 level, a rate ofgrowth that "is not sustainable nor equitable to our other majorforeign suppliers." China is now the United States' largesttextile supplier, he said.    Baldrige declined to say what would be an acceptable growthrate for Chinese textile exports. Negotiations on the nextChina-U.S. Textile agreement are due to begin in May, he said.    "There clearly has to be a limit," he said. "Our economy canonly absorb so much textiles. It is in both of our interests toreach a satisfactory conclusion. Without an agreement, we wouldhave a chaotic situation." Reuter
BRAZIL TRADE SURPLUS FALLS SHARPLY IN MARCH Brazil's trade surplus in Marchtotalled 136 mln dlrs, down from 1.13 billion dlrs in the samemonth last year, the official Banco do Brasil announced.    In a news conference, the director of the bank's ForeignTrade Department (Cacex), Roberto Fendt, attributed March's weak performance to labour strikes.    March exports totalled 1.43 billion dlrs, against 1.53billion dlrs in February, and 2.16 billion dlrs in March 1986.    March imports amounted to 1.29 billion dlrs compared to1.27 billion dlrs in February and 1.02 billion dlrs in March1986.    Fendt said coffee earnings were up to 220 mln dlrs in Marchfrom 110 mln dlrs in February, while oil derivatives were downto 54 mln dlrs from 58 mln dlrs in February.    He said that although the March results were considerablylower than the same month last year, the government's target ofan eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. TheJanuary-March trade surplus totalled 526 mln dlrs, below thesame period last year, which reached 2.46 billion dlrs.    Asked to explain the reason for his optimism, Fendt saidthe trade surplus should reach one billion dlrs in each of thelast six months of the year.    Even though results in the exports of steel, shoes andfrozen concentrated orange juice were weaker compared toFebruary, Fendt said this was not an indication that the UnitedStates was retaliating on account of its dispute with Brazil inthe issue of informatics.    For the next three months, Fendt estimated a monthly tradesurplus of 400 mln dlrs, for an overall surplus of 1.2 billiondlrs in the April-May-June period. Reuter

"My visit to the United States at this time will be the mostimportant visit of all," Nakasone said.    While in Washington, he said he hopes to have candid andfrank discussions with President Reagan and Congressionlleaders. He said he plans to discuss exchange rate stability,economic cooperation to developing countries and U.S.-Sovietdisarmament and arms control.    On the recently imposed trade sactions, Nakasone said hewould present evidence that Japanese semiconductor imports areincreasing and that Japan is monitoring exports to thirdcountries.    "We have full confidence we can present clear evidence," hesaid. "(Therefore), we will request that the sanctions be liftedat the earliest possible time."    On the trade imbalance, Nakasone said Japan has alreadytaken action. The volume of exports to the United States hasbeen cut, while U.S. Imports have increased.    But Japanese imports from Europe and other Asian nationshave recently surged, those from the United States remain weak,indicating a lack of U.S. Competitiveness, he said.    Nakasone said Japan will continue to strive to improve thetrade imbalance but the United States will have to become morecompetitive and improve its huge budget deficit.    He said he will also discuss the forthcoming Venice summitof the seven major industrial nations in June.

There are also strong signs Japanese exporters arediverting cars to the EC after the dollar's fall against theyen made their U.S. market unprofitable, he told reportersafter meeting U.S., Japanese, and Canadian trade ministers.    The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversionin Japanese exports from the U.S. To the EC market due tocurrency movements over the past two years, it will move toprevent it, he said.    Over the period, the yen has risen against the dollaralmost eight times as fast as against the European CurrencyUnit, he said.    Japan has set an unofficial, voluntary 10 pct rise in carexports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop itsrising trade surplus with the Community, which hit a record 18billion dlrs last year.    But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumpedover 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in U.S. Sales, and aseven per cent fall globally. "We think there is some diversionthere," said de Clercq. Reuter
NAKASONE ADVISED TO EXPAND PURCHASES ABROAD Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone wasadvised to work out a plan for his government to buy more thanone billion dlrs worth of foreign industrial products as partof efforts to defuse Japan's trade frictions with the UnitedStates, officials said.    Former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe made therecommendation at a meeting with Nakasone soon after returningfrom a U.S. Visit designed to pave the way for the primeminister's visit to Washington starting next Wednesday.    Abe met President Ronald Reagan and U.S. Congressionalleaders during his visit.    It was not known how Nakasone responded to the suggestion.    It also included increasing the nation's untied loans todeveloping countries to between 25 billion and 30 billion dlrsover the next three years and giving foreign firms greateraccess to a six billion dlr international airport project inwestern Japan, officials said.    Abe called for tax cuts and government funds to be funneledinto public works projects to stimulate domestic demand.

NAKASONE TO MEET REAGAN AMID TRADE TENSIONS Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone,beleaguered by political turmoil at home, sets out Wednesday ona tough mission to Washington aimed at defusing the mostserious U.S.-Japanese trade tension in recent memory.    Two rounds of talks between President Reagan and Nakasone,scheduled for Thursday and Friday, come on the heels of theimposition by the United States of punitive tariffs on Japanesegoods for the first time since World War Two.    In the past, bilateral trade friction involving cottongoods, steel, television sets, textiles and cars have endedwith Japan taking on voluntary export curbs.    Nakasone's visit could coincide with the passage of aprotectionist trade bill by the U.S. House of Representatives.    A proposed amendment to the bill, drafted by RepresentativeRichard Gephardt of Missouri, will mandate a 10 pct annualreduction in the trade surpluses of Japan and other nationswhich have large trade gaps with the United States.    The United States last year had a record trade deficit of169.8 billion dlrs and Japan accounted for about one-third.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said recentlyhe was reasonably optimistic about the results of talks betweenthe two leaders.    Top U.S. and Japanese officials have shuttled back andforth across the Pacific to lay the groundwork for Nakasone'svisit. The last of the talks leading up to the main event willbe in Washington next Wednesday between U.S. Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz and Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari.    Nakasone will have an economic package worked out by theruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and by an advisory bodyled by former Bank of Japan Governor Haruo Maekawa.    Japan plans to spend over 5,000 billion yen to boostdomestic demand, increase imports of U.S. products includingsupercomputers and give more help to developing countries,government officials said.    The government has been making last ditch efforts in timefor Nakasone's trip to address outstanding bilateral issues,officials said.    The issues include foreign access to a new Japaneseoverseas telecommunications venture and a six billion dlrinternational airport project in western Japan.    Nakasone and his party last week reached a compromiseaccord with opposition parties over a controversial sales taxplan in exchange for parliamentary passage by the Lower Houseof a government draft budget for 1987/88.    The accord, offered by House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara,virtually killed the Nakasone-sponsored plan, but left room forfuture tax reform plans, political analysts said.    Nakasone, who led his party to a resounding electoraltriumph last July, saw his popularity drop because of the salestax.    His party suffered setbacks in an Upper House by-electionand nationwide local elections in the past two months.    Mitsuru Uchida, professor of political science at WasedaUniversity, told Reuters: "I doubt that whatever Nakasone doesin Washington -- no matter how good it might be -- would helprestore his weakened power-base at home."    Many analysts said Nakasone might step down after theVenice summit of industrialized nations in June. Reuter
REAGAN HOPES TO LIFT JAPAN SANCTIONS SOON President Reagan said he hoped theUnited States could lift trade sanctions against Japan soon.    But he said the United States would do what is necessary tosee that other nations lived up to their trade agreements.    In a speech prepared for delivery to the U.S. Chamber ofCommerce, he said, "I hope that, before long, we can lift these(Japanese trade sanctions) and that this episode will berecorded as a small incident in the building of ourrelationship."    But, Reagan added, "we will do what is necessary to see thatother nations live up to their obligations and tradingagreements with us. Trade must be free. It must also be fair."    Reagan said the decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300mln dlrs worth of electronic exports to the United States senta message it was time to complete a U.S.-Japan "trade bridge."  "The final answer to the trade problems between America andJapan is not more hemming and hawing, not more trade sanctions,not more voluntary restraint agreements - though these may beneeded as steps along the way - and certainly not moreunfulfilled agreements," he said.    Reagan said the answer was genuinely fair and open marketson both sides of the Pacific - "and the sooner, the better."    Reagan said the administration's tools for dealing withunfair trade practices met the need for both firmness andfinesse.    He said trade legislation pending in Congress would bedangerous because it would force the administration to use "asteamroller against unfair practices every time, no matterwhether the steamroller would open the trade doors or flattenthe entire house," he said.    Reagan said that ending every unfair trade practice inJapan would cut the U.S. trade deficit by only about 10 pct.    "If our trade deficit is to come down, more must be done --and is being done," he said.    "The change in the dollar's value is part of it, and sincethe middle of last year, the actual volume of our exports hadbeen on the rise," he said.    He also said he believed America's trading partners shouldcut taxes and regulations, as the United States had done, sothat they could create jobs and buy more goods. Reuter

SEOUL ANNOUNCES MORE TARIFF CUTS FOR U.S. South Korea will cut import taxes on 50items, including construction equipment, photographic film,cigarettes and pipe tobacco, to help reduce its trade surpluswith the United States, the finance ministry said.    The tariff cuts, of between five and 30 percentage points,take effect on July 1.    This brings to 157 the number of goods on which importtaxes have been cut this year, a ministry official said.    The 157 are among about 290 items on which Washington hasasked Seoul to lower tariffs, he added.    Today's announcement follows Saturday's removal of importcurbs on 170 products. For 46 of those products, the U.S. Hadhad sought free access to the South Korean market.    "This is in line with the government's policy to limit ourtrade surplus with the United States to help reduce tradefriction between the two countries," the official said.    South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 7.3billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion in 1985. Officials saidthe surplus was expected to widen further in 1987 but Seoulwould try to hold it below eight billion dlrs.    The finance ministry said tariffs would be cut later thismonth on a further 53 items, including acrylic yarn andethylene, by an average 7.7 percentage points in order to checkinflation.    The officials said the tariff cuts would contribute toholding wholesale and consumer price rises at less than threepct this year. REUTER
U.S. STUDY SAYS TARIFFS AND QUOTAS COULD BACKFIRE The use of tariffs and quotas toreduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will dolittle to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a governmentstudy said.    In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products lesscompetitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost ofimported products that are re-exported in different forms.    "Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather thanhelp, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy," it said.    The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilkeand Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, whichclimbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shiftingcurrency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.    Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such asforeign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrialcompetitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictionson mergers, added little to the problem, it said.    "Although each industry's competitiveness affects the levelof imports and exports in that industry, in general we findthat there have been no significant industry-specific changesaffecting competitiveness that would explain the increase inthe overall trade deficit," the study said.    "To the extent any government action is needed to deal withthe trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-widephenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,"the FTC study said.    Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shiftswere the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the reportsaid it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost somedomestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.    It also said it found a "fairly direct relationship" betweenthe increased trade deficit and the influence of shiftingcurrency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domesticdemand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreignconsumer demand.    The study examined seven factors which have been commonlyblamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies andtrade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack ofinvestment in U.S. Industry, declining research and developmentin U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oilprices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.    In each case, the study found little or no evidence thatthe factor had any impact on the trade deficit. REUTER

Last week, foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed toimpose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electricalgoods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports.    Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of ECmanufactured goods in the year ended March 31.    "I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance throughexpansion."    "While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficitbetween Japan and the EC, I believe it should be rectified notby reducing trade through import restrictions or exportrestraints, but by expanding the (overall) trade," Tamura said.

U.S. WEIGHS LIFTING JAPANESE TRADE CURBS The White House has completed a newreview of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has notyet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan lastApril should be lifted, U.S. officials said.    They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked atJapan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pactyesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.    But there was no hint what the announcement might be.    Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs ofJapanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to behonoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.    But they also noted that the White House has said it wasunlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of theworld's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.    The officials added that while the curbs complicatedU.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was nottaking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.    Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation forJapan's failure to honor commitments to end dumpingsemiconductors in world markets at less than production costsand to open its own market to U.S. goods.    The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese televisionsets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.    Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted assoon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adheringto the pact. reuter
SHULTZ WELCOMES TOKYO ECONOMIC PACKAGE U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz saidthe 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo lastweek went further than the U.S. Had expected.    But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economicsanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyochanged its sales policies concerning computer microchips.    Speaking in a televised news conference linking severalEuropean capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that theJapanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic andglobal demand.    "There is an even greater amount of stimulus than wasoriginally thought," said Shultz, speaking from Washington.    "It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talkedabout when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.    "It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believethat getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating theeconomy," he added.    But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the newsconference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Mightdecide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions onsome Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:    "These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of anagreement that had been reached between the United States andJapan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chipmarket.    "They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to theagreement that it made become evident."    He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor thesituation for a month and that it was impossible to determine atrend on only one month's data.    The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personalcomputers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging thatJapan had violated last September's bilateral agreement byselling computer chips at below fair market value.    Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also dowell to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.    Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies totake action to stimulate the world economy without a boldAmerican initiative to reduce the size of the federal budgetdeficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle theproblem.    He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficitwould probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs againstlast year, and that the budget being worked on this year wouldcontain a major reduction.

REAGAN SEEKS ROMANIA TRADE CONCESSION President Reagan called for continuednondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the UnitedStates in the face of congressional opposition because of theBucharest government's record on human rights.    A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press forcontinuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status forRomania had been "exceptionally difficult" and came after "alloptions were seriously considered."    But the statement said that despite concerns about humanrights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president haddecided that should be continued because it helped stimulateemigration from Romania and gave the United States influence onhuman rights practices there.    The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congressrequests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungaryand China.    The House of Representatives has attached to a trade billlegislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pendingcertification by Reagan that the country had made progress onhuman rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFNfor Hungary and China. Reuter
INVESTMENT CRUCIAL TO U.S. TEXTILE RECOVERY With more private investment, not moreprotection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitivewith the most modern foreign producers, analysts from twocongressional agencies said today.    The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm ofCongress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearingthere was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason foroptimism than a few years ago.    "While textile producers are making significantinvestments, they could do more," OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.    The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisanbudget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loanguarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather thanincreased trade protection which could lead to foreignretaliation.    CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit forprofits and investments of domestic firms.    Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said theagencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion againstcongressional approval of protectionist textile quotalegislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and otherAsian textile producing countries.    President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection billbut it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and isexpected to be voted on in the House this year.    However, approval this year is in doubt because passage ofa major trade bill without specific protections for textilesshowed a weakening of support for the legislation.    Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreignproducers in the use of modern textile and apparel productionequipment and net imports are growing faster than the domesticmarkets, Kelly said.    He added that private investment in the textile andclothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-sevenththe average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.    Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports oftextiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pctwhile U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.    "The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced bynew technology, imports, or some combination of both. While theindustry may not be able to compete in all domestic marketsthat it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our researchindicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,and that exports can be expanded," Kelly said.

EC OFFICIAL WARNS U.S. ON UNILATERAL TRADE MOVES Roy Denman, the European Communityrepresentative in Washington, warned the United States againstsetting a rule that trading partners running a surplus shouldbe "beaten over the head" for not removing trade barriers.    Denman, in an Op-Ed piece in today's Washington Post, saidtrade disputes should be dealt with through negotiations,either bilaterally or multilaterally, through the Geneva-basedUnited Nations agency, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,GATT.    Denman's comments came as the Senate was to begin debatethis week on a major trade bill.    "It is dangerous to establish a rule that trading partnersrunning a surplus with the United States should be beaten overthe head if trade barriers objected to by the United States arenot removed within a certain time-scale," said Denman in anapparent reference to some of the measures in the congressionaltrade bill.    "If we turn to the path of unilateral action, retaliationand counter-retaliation, the one-world (GATT) trading systemwill very quickly unravel," he said.    Denman said the 170 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit was notpurely the result of unfair trade practices by foreign nations.    "The trade deficit results from a combination ofmacroeconomic factors (the U.S. budget deficit), the exchangerate and the competitiveness of (U.S.) domestic industry,"Denman said.    He also said that Washington employed what he termed unfairtrade prctices.    He said the European Community had recently updated a listof some 30 U.S. trade barriers that impede EC exports.    "We did not circulate this list with any hostile oraggressive intent. We did so to set the record straight," Denmansaid. Reuter

The U.S. Deficit,which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into whicheveryone's export-led strategy for growth has gone."    "The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed onthis deficit, so something will have to give and it will bepossibly a traumatic experience," he added.

EUROPEAN COMMUNITY CRITICISES U.S TRADE MEASURES The European Community (EC) accused theUnited States of violating a political commitment to free tradethrough practices including a tax on imported gasoline and acustoms user fee.    EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to thesurveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.    Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States incriticising Brazil for extending its list of products for whichimport licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as toimprove its balance of payments.    The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rulesby restricting imports of agricultural products through animport licensing system. The United States asked forconsultations with Tokyo on the issue.    Tran charged that the trade measures contravened apolitical commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.    When ministers established the four year Uruguay round tonegotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATTsurveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATTjargon as "standstill and rollback."    Tran criticised Washington for the "superfund" tax on oilimports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a specialmachine tool (known as category FSC34) from its governmentprocurement list for reasons of national security.    Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended thepolicies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.    The surveillance body will send a record of today's talksto the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,to decide any further action on the charges.    The oil tax and customs user fee have already been thesubject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside theUruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.    The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel'sreport and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil importsbreached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify itslegislation.    Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community,brought the dispute to the GATT last year. Reuter

U.S.-CANADA TIES SEEN WORSE WITHOUT TRADE PACT U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen ifthe two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policyresearch groups.    The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Instituteof Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on crossborder trade would benefit both countries.    But Cato chairman William Niskanen added "the two nations'generally harmonious trade relations are probably notsustainable without a new agreement."    The United States and Canada, whose cross-border tradetotaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holdingtalks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriersremaining between their two countries.    The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but bothsides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargainingremained.    Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade tiescould deteriorate because of Congressional pressure onPresident Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, andthis could hit some Canadian trade practices.    He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its autoindustry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateralfree trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.    Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable toa resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.exports to Canada.    A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada andenable its industries to achieve economies of scale, whichwould also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.    It would also increase the gross national products of bothcountries.    Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end alltariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rulesfor trade in services and investments, end curbs on governmentprocurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei, Indonesia,Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand the U.S.Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than manynow believed.    He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would notnecessarily stem from protectionist legislation now beingcontemplated by Congress, "but simply because of the adjustmentsthe U.S. Economy will have to make in order to service ourlarge and growing external debt."    Shultz said the U.S. Deficit had resulted not from fallingexports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth. REUTER

JAPAN MUST TRY HARDER TO CUT SURPLUS - MINISTER Japan must try harder to reduce its tradesurplus or the yen will come under renewed upward pressure,Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo.    He told a press luncheon he hoped Japan could cut itscurrent account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until itis reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs.

REAGAN SAYS TRADE BILL FACES VETO IN PRESENT FORM President Reagan said he would veto aHouse-passed trade bill requiring mandatory retaliation for"unfair trade" if it reached its desk in its present form.    In a statement at a White House meeting with SenateRepublicans on the legislation, he said: "I would have no choicebut to veto that bill in its present form."

AFRICAN STATES AGREE TO REGIONAL TARIFF CUTS Fifteen countries in Eastern andSouthern Africa have agreed to cut tariffs on regional trade by10 pct every two years up to 1996.    A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), whichseeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in thenorth to Lesotho in the south, said the governments would makethe first tariff cut next year.    In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariffreductions and work out a new timetable for the completeelimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000.    The PTA, set up in 1982, groups Burnudi, the Comoros,Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda,Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.    PTA sources said the agreement averted a split betweenmembers wanting more progress towards free trade and weakerstates concerned about the effects on customs revenue.    The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widelytraded commodities and goods but PTA sources said theorganisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items. Reuter

LATIN, CARIBBEAN NATIONS OPPOSE TRADE BILLS A group of Latin American andCaribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending inCongress, saying it would curb their exports, slow developmentand hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.    Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization ofAmerican States special committee on trade, said he was awareof the large U.S. trade deficit, but added "the region shouldnot be the one affected by the trade bills."    He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollarand the budget deficit, and "it is regrettable to solve it by atrade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests."    Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after twodays of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now inCongress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.    Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly atJapan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,annual trade surpluses with the United States.    Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nationswith large trade surpluses last year with the United States,but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.    The European Community has also opposed the bills.    Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed theReagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections inthe legislation, including those to curb imports and to requireretaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.    He told reporters the committee would likely mount acampaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debateon the Senate floor, expected next week.    Rodriguez said "the region needs trade to continuedevelopment.  We hope this need will not be affected negativelyby trade legislation."    Rodriguez said: "we need to keep the market opens -especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreignexchange not only to service the debt but also to continuenational development progress."    President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation hetermed "protectionist," and his aides now are mounting a effortto water down some of the objectionable provisions in thelegislation.    Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguezsaid as yet "the administration is not in a veto frame of mind." reuter
U.S. ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE TARIFF CATEGORIES The Administration asked Congress toreplace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring itinto line with international tariff categories, U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter said.    The new system will add such items as fiber optics and moreaccurately define new composites, items not widely traded whenthe current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.    Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule iscalled, will change tariff categories and definitions to meetthe present-day needs of exporters and importers, but theyshould pay about the same rates of duties.    Yeutter said, "American exporters will find it far easier todeal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety ofdiffering systems which they now face."    He said the new system ended 12 years of multinationalnegotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.    Yeutter said government and business moves are based ondata from tariff schedules and the new system will improveknowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.    He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards underthe new system, with about half expected to join the system byJanuary 1988. reuter
BANGLADESH'S TRADE GAP TO WIDEN IN 1987/88 Bangladesh's trade gap is expected towiden in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after thegovernment relaxed restrictions on some imports includingluxury cars.    The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and1.113 billion dlrs of imports.    Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changeswere aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boostforeign exchange earnings and imports of essential machineryand raw materials, to increase industrial production.    The government was easing procedures to enhance incentivesespecially for exporters of textiles and frozen food andimporters of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim toldreporters.    Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policycovered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billiondlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by thegovernment were not included in the policy, they added.    They said the country's total import bill (both commercialand other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs inthe new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.    The minister said ending restrictions on imports of carsand dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm theeconomy.    Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices forits main export jute, "which will certainly affect our exportearnings" in the coming year.    Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mlnin 1986/87, according official figures.    But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, whichaccounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, wouldplay a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target. REUTER
ARMISTICE ELUDES EC AND U.S. IN SPAGHETTI WAR Talks between the European Community(EC) and the United States have failed to settle a tradedispute over pasta, an EC Commission spokesman said.    Diplomatic sources said the dispute could provoke new tradefriction unless it was settled soon.    Washington is insisting that the EC comply with what itregards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATTand cut export subsidies which have allowed Italy to take anincreasing share of the U.S. pasta market.    The EC provides subsidies of about 16 cents a pound onpasta exports. The spokeswoman said the talks foundered on thequestion of how much the subsidy should be cut. Reuter
LYNG DEFENDS U.S. EXPORT SUBSIDY PROGRAM U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said the United States will continue its policy ofsubsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there isa global agreement to end such subsidies.    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he wastroubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program(EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exportsthat the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.    "Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit," he said. "There'sno question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow,the longer it is to wean it."    In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growinglist of commodities to an increasing number of countries.    Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies"just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy" and said he saw anend to the expansion of the EEP.    "I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doingthis to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets thatwe've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those,particularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, arethe worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, thatwe are prepared to continue to do this until we can come tosome agreement to put an end to it," he said.

September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly downfrom 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amountedto 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August.    Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept periodwas 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in asimilar 1986 period.    Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said.    The Cacex director said he expected the country's tradesurplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three monthsof the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and15.4 billion dlrs of imports.

U.S. MAY END ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN The United States may lift anadditional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan laterthis month, Reagan Administration officials said.    President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions onJapanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and thirdcountry markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.    The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct onJapanese color television sets, hand-held power tools andportable computers.    Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  afterJapan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market atbelow production costs.    Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memoryand recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.    The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of thesemiconductors in third countries, where they had been takingsales away from American-made semiconductors.    They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions wouldbe lifted by the end of the month.    The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening theclosed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.    U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliancewith the agreement earlier this week.    The periodic reviews are to continue and the remainingsanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan isin full compliance with the semiconductor agreement. reuter
CANADA SEEKS FIVE YEAR FARM REFORM PLAN Canada will propose at the new round ofinternational trade talks that most trade-distorting farmsubsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade MinisterPat Carney said.    "Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created avicious circle which continues to cause problems ofoverproduction and low commodity prices," Carney told the Houseof Commons.    Carney was outlining the government's new position on thefarm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in themultilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade).    While few details were released, Carney said the governmentwould also be pressing for an improvement in market access andnew measures to ensure countries do not erect artificialbarriers.    "Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have toensure that domestic policies and programs to address thespecific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade," agovernment background paper said.    "Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs,credit could be given to countries which effectively controlthe output of farm products," the papers said. Reuter
US SAYS CANADIAN, ISRAELI PACTS SHOULD SPUR TRADE Trade Representative Clayton Yeuttersaid on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canadaand Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing theglobal trading system.    He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set backworldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.    The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguayto liberalize the global trading system and to include in ittrade in agriculture and services such as banking.    Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meetingmarking the second year of their bilateral accord. TheCanadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yetbeen approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.    The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually removetariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods andmany services.    Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israelipacts "other countries have realized that if they want tocontinue to have access to the world's largest market, they hadbetter get serious about improving the GATT."    The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasingshipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantiallyincrease the gross national products in both countries.    Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts shouldserve as important precedents for progress in GATT.    Yeutter said, "increasing trade is one of the keys toenhanced political and economic stability around the globe."    He said, "a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not onlyfor advanced industrial nations, but also for other countriesthat need to increase trade in order to better their standardsof living."    Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progressmade in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting toprotectionism.    He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congressthat would force the United States to take retaliatory actionsagainst nations with large trade surpluses with the UnitedStates if the countries practiced unfair trade.    The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. tradedeficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is stillrising.    Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard toresist, but the pending legislation would undermine PresidentReagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.    Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.    He said, "President Reagan will veto any bill that containsserious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained." Reuter
EC, U.S. PLAN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS The European Community is willing tooffer limited concessions to the United States on one of twomajor issues which threaten to poison their trade relationsnext year, an EC commission spokesman said.

EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agricultureministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to makesome temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S.Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fedwith growth hormones, the spokesman said.    Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the ECproceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countriesdo not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to themakers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S.Manufacturers.    It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and willrob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year.
