JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES Japan is expected to cut the base lendingrate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 aspart of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,Finance Ministry sources said.    They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust FundBureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits withthe bureau.    The bureau channels funds to government financialinstitutions for public works and other official uses, theysaid.    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the JapanDevelopment Bank, People's Finance Corp and the financecorporations of local public enterprises usually moves intandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust FundBureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce amarket-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate thedomestic economy, they said.    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cuttheir prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositorsusing the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts andTelecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity ofthe Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.    These ministries are trying to determine which market ratesshould be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,the ministry sources said.    Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added. REUTER
ITALIAN TREASURY CUTS INTEREST ON CERTIFICATES The Italian treasury said annual couponrates payable March 1988 on two issues of long-term treasurycertificates (CCTs) would be cut by about four percentagepoints compared with rates this March.    Coupon rates on 10-year certificates maturing March 1995will fall to 9.80 pct from 13.65 pct and rates on 10-yearissues maturing in March 1996 would fall to 10.05 pct from14.30 pct.    The Treasury also cut by 0.60 point six-monthly couponspayable this September on six issues maturing between September1988 and September 1991.    The issues carry terms of between five and seven years andwill have coupon rates of between 4.85 and 5.65 pct inSeptember compared with 5.45 and 6.25 pct this March. REUTER
JAPAN TO PROMOTE INTEREST RATE LIBERALISATION The Bank of Japan decided at a policyboard meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisationby lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free largedeposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on moneymarket certificates (MMCs), a central bank official said.    The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the banksaid.    Under the guideline, the minimum denomination ofregulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yenfrom 300 mln.    The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities ofbetween one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentagepoint below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, thebank said.    But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or lesswill remain the same, or 0.75 percentage point below the CDrates.    The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mlnyen from 30 mln.    The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by0.37 point, effective March 16, in line with the half-point cutin the official discount rate on February 23.    New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits atbanks, for example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum,respectively.    Demand deposit rates, however, will remain the same. REUTER
 MAJOR SWISS BANKS RAISE CUSTOMER TIME DEPOSIT RATES 1/4 POINT TO THREE PCT - CREDI Fisons Plc <FISN.L> said stronginternational growth had been the main feature of the group's1986 progress, with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period.    The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme, alarger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form ofits Intal anti-asthma drug, which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct.    The company was commenting on 1986 results which sawpre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985.The result was in line with market forecasts, but its sharesnevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from643p.    Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral, aswell as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products, was clearlyindicated by a strong 1986 performance.    The scientific equipment business had raised the proportionof high technology products it manufactures and also raised itsability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operationshad demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cashflow from all three operations had been positive despite a fullprogramme of capital investment.    Action to protect the group against foreign currencymovements resulted in a small net gain to profits. REUTER

SPAIN DEREGULATES BANK DEPOSIT INTEREST RATES Spain's Finance Ministry deregulated bankdeposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks andbring legislation into line with the European Community (EC), aministry spokesman said.    The measure was published today in the Official StateGazette. It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions onrates, now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days.

BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain'sdecision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savingsbanks, saying it reflected the socialist government'sdetermination not to ease up in the fight against inflationdespite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.    The central bank last night raised the requirement by onepercentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excessliquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.    Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by theBank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates tochoke off money supply growth.    "I think it's a good measure," a senior foreign banker said."It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest ratesand avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy."    "It shows that the political will is very strong. They knowthat controlling inflation will make industry more competitiveand bring down unemployment in the long run," he added.    The head of another foreign bank said that only a monthago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a risein reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy ofraising interest rates.    But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting moneyfrom abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanishexports less competitive.    The government says industry's competitiveness is alsobeing hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate wasway above that of Spain's major trading partners in theEuropean Community, which it joined a year ago.    To help meet this year's target of five pct, it isinsisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage forclashes with trade unions, who say they have made enoughsacrifices.    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whosedemands essentially involve more government spending, havebecome an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister FelipeGonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.    Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could havesome impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit themoney market too hard.    The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its keyovernight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged attoday's auction. The rate has been increased nine times sincethe start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.    Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise inany case with the end of the six pct maximium interest ratebanks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.    The measure will take effect tomorrow, following thepublication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankerssay the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,inevitably, push lending rates higher.    A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds whichbanks must invest in specific areas, also takes effecttomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last monththat it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higherinterest rates. REUTER
FED NOT EXPECTED TO TAKE MONEY MARKET ACTION The Federal Reserve is not expected tointervene in the U.S. government securities market to add ordrain reserves, economists said.    Most economists said they did not expect the Fed to addreserves with Federal funds trading below six pct.    They said the funds rate's softer tone may indicate thatthe need to add reserves in the current bank reservemaintenance period is smaller than previously estimated.    Fed funds opened at 5-15/16 pct and remained at that level.Yesterday funds averaged 6.01 pct. Reuter
BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT The Bank of England again fought againstmoney and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest ratecut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further risein its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.    It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pctof its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continuedto buy into a currency which offers high relative returns andthe possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.    Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank canstop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should wantto.    The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wantsrates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, whenit lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct torelieve a money market shortage.    "They're really making the discount houses suffer," saidStephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew."Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates."    This money market signal was apparently not accompanied byany sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which hadinhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers camestrongly into the pound.    The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the Londonclose, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60marks, up from 2.8720/50.    "If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility thatrates could drop before the Budget," said Jeremy Hale, economistat finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.    Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in thebase rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.    However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to beconvinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-ratingrather than a result of short-term speculative gains.    There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, saidPeter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.    Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances ofa Conservative Party victory in any early general election, anddisappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides tohold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setbackfor bonds, Fellner said.    An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but mostforecasts say it will be this year.    Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable tooil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.    However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to setthe timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.    The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainablerate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.    Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at leasta proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-termcapital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.    They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer betthan the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls andcurrent political upheavals in Washington.    The Bank may want to see another few points on thetrade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. "But bythen sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank ofEngland," he added.    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resistingpressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sourcessaid the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as morethan just marking up by foreign exchange traders.    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentiallyharmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing thatthe current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.    This was above previous estimates of the current accountdeficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.    Fellner said that under more normal conditions this wouldhave given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that theywere too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.    The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearingbanks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bankofficials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for thisweek, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-pointcut, with another half or full point about Budget day.

FED'S JOHNSON SAYS HE DOES NOT SEE INCREASING PRESSURE ON INTERE Australia accused the U.S. of increasingprotectionism on agricultural products and called for an end toWashington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT ruleson agricultural trade.    Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at aspecial annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.    "Australia today said the United States' goals of reducingU.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted byactions which in fact increased protection in trade inagriculture," the Australian delegation said in a statement.    "The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basicflaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture," Arnott told themeeting.    Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as ajustification for "dubious protective measures" by the U.S. Helisted a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps toclose the U.S. sugar market to imports.    He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington toimpose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domesticsupport programs. This covered imports of dairy products,peanuts, cotton and sugar.    Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to theGATT, told Reuters: "These charges have been made since the verybeginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agriculturalpolicy, part of our law when we joined the GATT".    "We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during theUruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same withtheir programs. We can negotiate them all," Samuels added.    Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguayround of talks launched in Punta del Este last September.Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking,tourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well asmanufactured goods.

BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES This week's Bank of England resistance tostrong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded inholding bank base rates at 11 pct.    But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the ParisGroup of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterlingbroadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sourcessaid.    Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closingtrade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after theParis meeting and up 0.4 on the day.    Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.    A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanteda substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question istherefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch EuropeLtd, estimated that the government wanted to see thetrade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. "Even after this actionover the last few weeks, sterling's only just within strikingdistance of that range," he said.    Other analysts agree that the government probably has somebroad target range around this area.    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see thepound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk ofa loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.    "If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as theyare, what's to stop it (going higher)," said John Cox, executivedirector of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the Londonforeign exchange market.    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been activeselling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack ofgeneral market talk of such intervention, and this has helpedkeep it below 1.60 dlrs.    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterlingheading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if itholds around these levels.    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interestrate boat. "If rates don't come down, the market will say theyought to have come down and will sell sterling," he said.    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of "hot money" beinginvested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnightor one-week rates, which could flow out at equally shortnotice.    However, the authorities will hope that at least aproportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.    "The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) andhave to jack them back up again," said Richard Jeffrey,economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support forsterling, at least in the near term.    However, most analysts are still looking for a full pointabout March 17, Budget Day.    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to theBudget, said Temperton.    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in therun-up to a general election, the major factor behind currentbullishness in the government bond and currency markets.    "Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest ratecut," said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, theequities arm of Mercury International Group.    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead theway lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall inthe weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct lastFriday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.    This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 113/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowestsince base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.    However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-monthsmoney, banking sources said the market could not take the cutas a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates. REUTER

GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS Increased federal government borrowingneeds and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buymark assets could push yields in German public authority bondshigher this year, bond market sources say.    "At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-termrates. But how rates move in the long end will depend stronglyon foreigners," one portfolio manager for a large securitiesinvestment house in Frankfurt said.    The sources also said the government had already stepped upits borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.    Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, thesources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of sixpct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.    This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pctcoupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.    But dealers said the terms were not enough to attractforeign investors, and the federal government would have topush yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.    Sources noted federal government issues had also increasedin size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volumeonly starting last May.    One finance ministry economist said "It isn't more. It'sjust the size (of each bond) which has increased." He addedconditions in the capital market currently remained fairlyfavourable for raising new debt.    Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.    With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, ashopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.    Sources said the government has may have already stepped upits borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.    The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowingthrough bonds was 26.6 billion.    The sources said this indicated a move by the governmentout of other types of debt to gain access to foreign fundsthrough the more acceptable loan stock form.    Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a largeamount of issues maturing recently, other factors, includingthe government's tax reduction program, would also reduceincome next year. "The problem here will be the tax reform," theportfolio manager said.    He added that the government's cut in its top income taxrate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult forthe government to reduce borrowings.    The sources said the government would fall far short ofcovering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from thetax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced tofall back on debt markets in one form or the other.    The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federalgovernment loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallenback twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through theissue of fixed-rate medium-term "Kassenobligation" notes.    A finance ministry economist said the government did notexpect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only anet 22.3 billion marks this year.    Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend wouldprobably not continue next year as the further tax cuts comeinto effect.    "I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform wouldmean government borrowing will increase," the manager said.    Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, withthe Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculationfalling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.    But sources said foreign demand for the new federalgovernment loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that thedollar may now rise against the mark.    "The demand wasn't so good," a dealer for a German bank inLondon said.    The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the markeven meant that foreign investors have sold mark bondsrecently, some dealers said. REUTER

U.K. ISSUES ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE The Bank of England said it was takingonto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pctTreasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct onapplication. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pctand will be available for dealings from March 11, with theremainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said thebonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be freeof tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 "B."  A further 100 mln stg wasreserved for the National Debt Commissioners.    The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank'sannouncement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20minutes after the news.    Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against thebackdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rateswhich had built up over the past two weeks as a result ofsterling's strength.    The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared tosee lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoonannounced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11pct.    The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a ratecut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delaya reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.    However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorableclimb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure andallow a half-point cut.    Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the marketas a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further earlyrate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.    Most market participants believe that Lawson will nowfoster a further half point interest rate reduction at the timeof the budget, although one or two said they would not besurprised to see a full point decline at this stage.    Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attemptslast week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issueda one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing theGovernment bond market.    To the surprise of most participants, the issue was soldout within hours of becoming available for trading and themarket pushed on to register further sharp gains.    Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that theissue announced today would be absorbed by the market asrapidly as last week's.    However, they noted that although sterling had edged downfrom its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closedon a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300GMT.

WORLD BANK TO BRING BORROWING FORWARD THIS YEAR The World Bank intends to bringborrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because itexpects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bankvice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.    He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan,West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. "The weightof opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higherprobability there will be one pct higher than one pct lowerinterest rates," he said.    The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so farthis year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.    The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at alevel that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where andhow much to borrow, Rotberg said.    Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years'anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstandingdebt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.    Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, itdid not intend to launch new financial instruments just for thesake of innovation, Rotberg said.    Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only someeight billion had been swapped into another currency.    Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors orunfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident thatthis was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.    The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed overthe next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However,for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out newinstruments such as bonds with warrants.    The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germanysince the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.

U.S. SELLS 3-MO BILLS AT 5.63 PCT, STOP 5.64 PCT, 6-MO 5.59 PCT, STOP  A top Treasury official said he doesnot expect any comprehensive Congressional reform of the U.S.banking industry until after the 1988 presidential election dueto political pressures and, to a lesser extent, the insidertrading scandal on Wall Street.    George Gould, Under Secretary of the Treasury, told a WallStreet Planning Group luncheon, "legislation is not going tohappen before the election ... (people) do not like to vote oncontroversial issues in election years."    "It may take a while in the next administration ... to getsomething done," he added.    Calls for a major overhaul of the U.S. banking industry,which would probably feature wider investment banking powersfor commercial banks, has met strong opposition from privateinterest groups, such as the Securities Industry Association.    "These discussions have nothing to do with merit ... thesegroups are trying to cloak self-interest in public policyterms," Gould said. "It is easier to stop something than it isto get it going."    He also described current concern about insider trading as"a major impediment to further progress ... it is not a helpfulbackdrop to accomplish financial reform."    Similarly, Gould said lobbying by such groups as the U.S.League of Savings Institutions would probably mean that theReagan Administration's proposal for the recapitalization ofthe Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp would be watereddown.    Gould foresaw a five billion dlr injection over two years,compared with the original request for 15 billion dlrs overthree years.    Gould ruled out any new government initiative on bankingreform but said that some broad guidelines to address theseissues would be made public over the next few months. Reuter

 Belgium cuts discount rate to 8.0 pct from 8.50 -  A spokesman for PreussagAG <PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the companywould pay a dividend on 1986 results    He was commenting on a Preussag statement which saidresults in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag hasfrequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986following a difficult year in 1985.    Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said inDecember the board would prefer to stick to its policy of notdipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted thefinal dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.    The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 comparedwith 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil andshipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends inthe group's other divisions.    The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domesticgroup would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would dependpartly on the level of provisions.    Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from ninemarks on 1984 results after parent company net profit droppedto 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.    The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marksin 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.    The statement said its results in 1986 were affected byunsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as bypoor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.    The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarterof 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was anadditional factor behind the drop in results.    Preussag said rationalization measures already introducedwould not begin to take full effect until this year.    Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billionmarks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the firsttime consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from itsmajority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.    Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alonewas 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparisonfigures.    Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production roseto 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.    Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)subsidiary, whose results are included in the world groupaccounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter oflast year.    AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by theinternational tin crisis, were the reason behind the worldgroup losses that year. REUTER

U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN The U.S. is urging reluctantcommercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novelPhilippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believesthe innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debtstrategy, a Reagan administration official said.    The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleasfor interest rate concessions should be treated much moreseriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developingnations are carrying out genuine economic reforms.    In addition, he signaled that the banks might want toreconsider the idea of a "megabank," where Third World debt wouldbe pooled, and suggested the administration would support sucha plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At thesame time, however, the official expressed reservations thatsuch a scheme would ever get off the ground.    The Philippine proposal, together with Argentinesuggestions that "exit bonds" be issued to end the troublesomerole of small banks in the debt strategy, would help tounderpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan,the official said in an interview with Reuters.    "All of these things would fit within the definition of ourinitiative as we have asked it and we think any novel andunique approach such as those should be considered," said theofficial, who asked not to be named.    In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategyunder which commercial banks and multilateral institutions suchas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.    In return, America called on the debtor countries to enacteconomic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.    "The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtorshave been performing well," said the official. But he admittedthat the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly anexception.    The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S.Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker,also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improvetheir role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.    "We called at the very beginning for the bank syndicationsto find procedures or processes whereby they could operate moreeffectively," the official said.    Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions thatcommercial banks create a "megabank" which could swap Third Worlddebt paper for so-called "exit bonds" for banks like regionalAmerican or European institutions.    Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need tolend money to their former debtors every time a new moneypackage was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina inits current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.    He emphasised that the "megabank" was not an administrationplan but "something some people have suggested."    Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks areexamining the creation of a consortium bank to assume ThirdWorld debt. This plan, actively under consideration, woulddiffer slightly from the one the official described.    But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a planwould work in the United States.    "If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go,fine. I don't think they ever will."    He pointed out that banks would swap their Third Worldloans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctantto provide new money to debtors through the new institution.    Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan underwhich it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at nomore than 5/8 pct above Libor.    "The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quiteunique and I don't think it's something that should becategorically rejected out of hand," the official said.    Banks which found this level unacceptably low would beoffered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a marginabove that of one pct in the form of Philippine InvestmentNotes.    These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have asix-year life and if banks swapped them for cash beforematurity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 pointover Libor.    Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far toolow. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed atstretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt andgranting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduleddebt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political supportin Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early lastyear, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.    But the official denied the plan amounts to interest ratecapitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to thebanks. "It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if youhave a write down in the spread over Libor from what existedbefore," the official said in comments suggesting some ought tobe granted the rate concessions they seek. "Some people arguethat (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it reallyis is narrowing the spread on new money," he added.    He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as aninitiative to include plans like the Philippines'. Reuter
BRAZIL'S GROS TO MEET BANKS ON TRADE LINE ISSUE Brazil's central bank governorFrancisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here todayin a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country'sunilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrsof foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said.    Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head ofBrazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads MorganGuaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc.    High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil'saccompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term tradeand interbank lines, the bankers said.    Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreedlast March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, aspart of a 31 billion dlr financing package.    Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupledwith Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legalquestions that the banks want to discuss with Gros.    They said they face problems because of the freezerequirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bankunder the trade facility must be deposited instead with thecentral bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switchtheir credit lines from one borrower to another.    The requirement to deposit with the central bank has alsomeant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lowerinterest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would ratheraccept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with thecentral bank.    "It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,"one banker said.    Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results ofa 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance ministerDilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support forBrazil's debt stance.

NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES U.K. Interest rates look set to movelower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension ofa British National Savings issue yesterday.    The Department of National Savings, effectively a TreasuryDepartment unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launchedin October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-yearprivate investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman saidthe suspension was just a reaction to yields on nationalsavings bonds being way out of line with the rest of themarket.    The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutestoday of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, thesecond such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.    They said the near-instant sale of the entire new giltsissue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pctdownpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rateshad to drop sooner rather than later.    The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downwardpressure on money market rates remained intact, with thebellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at10-9-7/8 pct.     It coincided with another strong sterling rally whichpushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar.    "That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed," saidStephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokersPhillips and Drew; "It is an indication that the market believesrates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-pointimmediately after the budget (on March 17), and some peoplehope for more."    Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by theNational Savings Department was "of considerable significance."    It said, "the real message ... Is that the decks are beingquickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by thebuilding societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cutin bank base rates to 10 pct materialises."    Building societies have said a drop in bank base rateswould normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to areduction in mortgage lending rates.    Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed theNational Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasurypolicy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.    "National Savings has been competing too effectively withthe building societies of late. Building society income hasbeen depressed in recent months," he said.    He and other analysts said Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lidon U.K. Inflation.    Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britainthan in most other Western economies with inflation seen risingwell above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 afterlast year's 3.7 pct.    Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumerprices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rateswould reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.    But Lewis and others noted that building societies had beencomplaining to the government about intense competition fromNational Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for earlymortgage rate cuts.    "The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBRfunding from National Savings, but he must be taking thebuilding societies' criticism to heart. It looks like theNational Savings move reflects this," one senior dealer said.    A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on thisinterpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely areaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which hadpushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line withthe rest of the market.    "We are not politically motivated ... Funding was justbecoming too expensive and we don't need all that money," hetold Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues atleast twice in the past, when offered interest rates were aboveor below market rates.    He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late asU.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline andincome was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billionstg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31.    In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving'scontribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg,compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of theprevious year, official figures show.    Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show afurther increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing thetotal for 11 months above target, government officials said. REUTER
U.K. BANKS OFFER FIXED-RATE MORTGAGES AT 10.2 PCT Two major U.K. Clearing banks announcedthey will offer a total of 800 mln stg in new mortgages at afixed interest rate of 10.2 pct for the first three years,below current bank base lending rates of 10.5 pct.    Midland Bank Plc <MDBL.L> said it has initially allocated500 mln stg for home loans at this rate, while Lloyds Bank Plc<LLOY.L> will offer 300 mln stg.    Earlier this week, Midland said it would cut its standardrate of mortgage payment to 11.5 pct from April 1, following ahalf a percentage point reduction in leading banks' baselending rates from 11 pct.    Building society and other bank mortgage rates are largelystill well above the new base rate level, although last yearLloyds offered a fixed rate of 9.9 pct on certain home loans.    A Midland spokesman said his bank calculated that at thecurrent level of 2.7 billion stg, its existing mortgage bookaccounts for about 5 pct of the total British home loan market.    Lloyds said it has 3.6 billion stg in outstanding mortgageloans, but had not estimated its total market share.    Among other major clearing banks, Barclays Plc <BCS.L> andNational Westminister Bank Plc <NWBL.L> said they had noimmediate plans to announce similar fixed rate schemes. Reuter

In addition, Pegasus said it began mining and processingoperations at its Zortman/Landusky Mine one month ahead ofschedule.    Pegasus said it completed the first phase of its 1987 SuperPad ahead of schedule as well, allowing the mining company toload up to 7.5 mln tons of new ore on the pad.

TRADING RANGE LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN DEBT FUTURES U.S. economic data due out next week isunlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interestrate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range ofthe last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said.    "People don't seem to have any firm conviction about thecurrent strength of the economy or about the Federal Reservedoing anything," said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst NormanMains.    The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on tradingvolume, he noted. "We've had a decline in activity as recenteconomic statistics have not greatly changed people'sviewpoints on interest rates," Mains said.    The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of theeconomy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchangemarkets after the Paris initiative has made for "less thanebullient market action," Mains said.    He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be infor a retracement after the recent rise as they are near thetop of the trading range.    "My view is that the economy remains relatively strong andmarket participants will see that current prices areunjustified," Mains said.    Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also notedthat the market is showing very little momentum and lacksretail interest. "All of the movement occurs at the opening,"afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said.    Although data during the week was mildly positive for bondprices, the small rise in February producer prices and downwardrevisions in January retail sales and industrial productionwere "not real exciting," said Prudential Bache analyst FredLeiner.    "There is no one factor that will push us through the highsat this moment," Leiner said.    Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross nationalProduct is also likely to be of little interest to the market,said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan.Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in thedirection of bond prices over the next month.    Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth isaround three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventoriesreflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showedthe largest increase since 1979.    "The key question will be not whether there is a largeincrease in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase issustainable or a one shot deal," Kahan said.    He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNPstemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag onsecond quarter growth.    If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could easeback to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said. Reuter
PHILIPPINES SEES 1987 GOVERNMENT REVENUE UP 26 PCT Philippine government revenue isexpected to rise 26 pct to 99.9 billion pesos this year from79.1 billion in 1986, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.    In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department'sperformance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said atleast 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new taxreform measures announced last year.    He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA)this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors havecommitted ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pctfrom 1.3 billion in 1986.    Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue baseincluded a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in1988. He gave no other details.    He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels andthe volume of government securities sold to the private sectorhave improved significantly. "In particular, short-term primeinterest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now downto less than 10 pct," he said.    Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introducedin August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worthof applications, but selective evaluation had resulted inapprovals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February.    He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisationprogram and the sale of non-performing assets owned byassociates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would helpfinance land reform.    Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billionpesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failedcompanies will be used to finance the land reform plan.    Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts toobtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the programfrom a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral andbilateral aid donors.    The government has said the land reform plan aims todistribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants. REUTER

ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE British bank base lending rates arelikely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct thisweek following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K.Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set intoday's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.    The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and moneymarkets had already started to reward.    Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and moneymarket interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budgetmeasures came through, the analysts said.    Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said heexpected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.    "This is very much a safety-first budget in order to getinterest rates down," he said.    Bootle said the money markets had almost entirelydiscounted such a one point cut, with the key three monthinterbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, andit would be rather conservative for banks to go for ahalf-point cut now.    Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday,but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.    "This budget is designed to please both the markets and theelectorate. The implications for interest rates are veryfavourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and anothersuch cut before the end of the week," Simmonds said.    Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, hesaid Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cutin income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target."There is no real need to boost private consumption," he said.    National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern saidthe lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased thelikelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.    Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve thesharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-pointbase rate cut could be implemented. But providing the budget small-print was convincing, "and Isuspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see onepoint off base rates by the end of this week," Kern said.    Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pavethe way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumerprice inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.    U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, moneyand government bonds (gilts) markets.    But building societies said they would not cut lendingrates until base rates had fallen by one full point. REUTER
U.S. FHL BANKS SETS 6.70 PCT, 7.10 PCT, 7.65 PCT RATES ON 2.55 BILLION D OPEC believes world oil prices shouldbe set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPECAssistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today.    In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminarin Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: "OPEC believes...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictionsand should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs."    But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level hadcaused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced tocurtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPECstates could not be sustained in some cases.    "For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is nowconsidered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its membercountries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailingproduction," Al-Wattari said.    "Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,"Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures,some states depended on associated gas output for domestic useand oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.    Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below theorganization's agreed ceiling for all member countries inFebruary, although this had meant sacrifices.    The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability,though restored to a good level, was still under pressure,Al-Wattari said. "A lasting stability in the world marketrequires a wider scope of international cooperation," he added.    He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown apolitical willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.    But although cutbacks announced by these states werepolitically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they wereinsufficient in terms of volume, he added. "The overall majorityof non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC'scalls for supply regulation," he said.    Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as itallowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC tocontinue, while not generating excessive cash flow forotherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a pricewould no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added.    Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, alsoaddressing the seminar, added that discipline was still neededto prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market.    Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageousfor both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperationwould ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue. Reuter

THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT Officials of five Thai commercial banksare expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cuttinginterest rates, banking sources said.    They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spurdomestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidityon the money market.    Many bankers have been urging an average half percentagepoint cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lendingrates, they said.    Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan andoverdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, thesources said.    Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since earlylast year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The currentgross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank depositand the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade.    Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have createdproblems for many banks in managing their money effectively.    Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partlybecause of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth.The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thaibanking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansionin bank deposits.    Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts havefurther buoyed the Thai stock market this week.    The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Mondayrecorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02.    Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will registermore gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market.    Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem willgrow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission forlocal banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct ofbank capital.    If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expirydate, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreignexchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.    Bankers said such that could add another five billion bahtof surplus funds to the local money market. REUTER
BANK OF ENGLAND SIGNALS HALF POINT CUT IN SHORT TERM RATES - Turner and Newall Plc said it planned toraise a net 71.7 mln stg with a one-for-six rights issue of36.15 mln shares.    The shares would be offered at 205p, compared with Turner'sprice which fell to 227p from last night's close at 241p.    The group said the funds would be used to cut borrowings,which had risen to 234 mln stg at end-February, largely as aresult of the takeover of <AE Plc>.    The company also reported pretax profits rising to 44.7 mlnstg from 39.6 mln previously.    It noted that the purchase of AE involved the payment ofsome 125 mln stg cash as well as taking on AE's own borrowingsof some 85 mln stg. The net debt/equity ratio at the year endhad risen to 59 pct from 23 pct the year before, it added. Therights issue would cut borrowings and also allow furtherdevelopment through investment and acquisition.    But it said that the purchase of AE -- which was won aftera long and acrimonious battle last year -- greatly strengthenedthe group's position in the automotive components andengineering materials sectors.    In the 15 months to end-1986 AE produced pretax profits of27.4 mln stg compared with 25.6 mln in the 12 monthspreviously.   As the offer for AE was not declared unconditional untilDecember 5, it made a negligible contribution to Turner's 1986results.    Turner said the prospects were good and it looked forwardto taking advantage of the opportunities available.   1986 operating profits were higher in all areas apart fromZimbabwe mines, which were hit by the strength of the localcurrency against the dollar.

WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES West German commercial banks arecautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, bankingsources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after theBundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than theusual interim period.    A Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cuttingleading savings rate for private customers on a regional basisby 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F>and Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bankfuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.    The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire togauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savingsbanks.    A fall in customer savings because of lower rates couldreduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them todraw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, oneeconomist at the German Banking Association said.    But the volume of savings funds may not be substantiallyundercut by lower savings rates because many customers areparking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvestthem at higher yields in the future, he said.    He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move morefunds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-datedsecurities to reduce strong growth in its central bank moneysupply aggregate.    The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside theexpanded target range of three to six pct.    Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to privatecustomers, though lending rates for corporate customers arebeginning to decline. REUTER

VOLATILITY LIKELY TO REMAIN LOW IN DEBT FUTURES Financial analysts see little chancethat U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrowranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week.    "We got a little volatility Wednesday," said StaleyCommodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. "But for themoment we're still in a trading range."    Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of theU.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of itssluggish state, the analysts said.    "It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it canbreak out of its very low volatility," said Carroll McEntee andMcGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. "It needs something, but it'snot going to be news about the economy," he said.    Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break outof the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar hasstabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conductmonetary policy.    But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, thedollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attractedeager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.    In addition to a changing perception about the dollar andmonetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinnsaid the beginning of April could bring foreign investors backinto the marketplace.    "The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at thebeginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1," Quinn said.    Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there arelarge amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japaneseinvestment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start ofJapan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bondmarket, he said.    "We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bringyields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct," compared tothe current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.    In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is notlikely to move futures.    The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refundingoperation did little to move cash government securities priceslate Wednesday after the close of futures.    "I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (thetrading range)," Lacey said. Reuter

GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING The Association of German CooperativeBanks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rateswould continue to remain low for the time being.    It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strongforeign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors inthe economy that could affect the long-term capital market.    The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion forhigher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflationlate this year could give very slight grounds for a rise innominal rates at year's end and next year, it said.    The association said generally low interest rates,prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expectedstrong domestic demand led it to believe that the investmentclimate would remain friendly and the economy would continueits slow but very sure growth.    The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interestrates down on the short-term money market although its policieshad exerted little effect on the long-term capital market,which was so important for investment financing and thus forthe course of the economy, it said.    In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policyhad in influencing the longer-term capital market, theassociation saw little sense in wanting to boost the economythrough a short-term and expansionist monetary policy.    On the other hand it also saw no reason for stickingdogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.    The association said time would show to what extentspeculative foreign money and short-term invested domesticmoney would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbankcould hold down money market rates with the highly effectiveinstrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said. Reuter

GERMAN BOND YIELDS SEEN FALLING IN NEAR TERM  West German bond yields could declineover the next few months if recent efforts to stabilizeexchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend tokeeping down European interest rates, banking economists said.    But in the longer term domestic yields could rise underagreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said.    The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilizedcurrencies with the threat of central bank intervention,economists said.    Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolsterthe pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest ratesfurther when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April."The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbankand the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rateare significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S.and foreign interest rates," Salomon Bros Inc said in a recentstudy.    It said narrowing of international interest rate spreadswas a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads willhave to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.    West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouragedthe U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when theBundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoidweakening the dollar.    West German economists see room for further cuts in leadingWest German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.    "It's not a taboo," Peter Pietsch, spokesman for CommerzbankAG said.    But most economists see room for a cut in West German ratesonly in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflationwill limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.    The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is alreadynearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April. Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors toshift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a movewould tend to flatten the yield curve between short andlong-term rates, which has become more pronounced since theBundesbank lowered its discount rate.    It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, asthe shift out of savings accounts into securities would slowgrowth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.    But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase WestGerman tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed tomeet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move mayforce interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which mustbe filled by higher government borrowing.    This may not occur if private sector demand for creditremains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.    Economists said it appeared the government had alreadystepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss fromother sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker thanexpected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.    Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West GermanIfo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by theWest German government in November.    Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up.But coupled with other factors such as waning foreignspeculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, longterm yields may to have to rise, economists said.    Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing toincreases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.    The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.    West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increasedborrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday hewas looking for other ways to finance the reform, such asraising indirect taxes.    But few economists believe the government will be able togo through with its tax measures without increasing netborrowing.    The Bundesbank said in its February report that it waswrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986could be managed without increasing deficits.    The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borroweda large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 finalquarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.

BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.5 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securitiesrepurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesmansaid.    Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity,will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buyback securities pledged on April 22.    The allocation was in line with market expectations theBundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marksdraining from this week as an earlier facility expires.    Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said.    The excess allocation compensates for public funds leavingthe system which the Bundesbank added last week viagovernment-owned banks.    However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customersdrew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity.    The call money declines surprised some dealers, whospeculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed furthergovernment funds today. However, most said this had notoccurred.    Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billionmarks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion.For all of March, banks would be required to hold net dailyaverage reserves of 50.7 billion marks, dealers said.

Danish overnight money market rate cut to 10 pct from 10.5 - cent Australia's largest company, The BrokenHill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> (BHP), is expected to report a netprofit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the firstnine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuterssaid.    This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in thefirst three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 311986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.    The analysts estimated that the group would report a thirdquarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.    BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amountedto 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.    The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn inpetroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflectingsome improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Straitfields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral andsteel earnings.    They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coalprices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has beenaffected by industrial and production problems.    The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP'slowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around300 mln dlrs.    One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be atax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance oncapital expenditure in the steel division, they said.    They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it wouldbe difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit. REUTER
BANK OF SPAIN PROVIDES YEAR RECORD ASSISTANCE FUNDS The Bank of Spain provided 1,145 billionpesetas in assistance funds which bankers said reflected fearsof fresh increases in overnight rates.

A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higherovernight call money rates were expected in the short term inview of disappointing money supply figures for February.    The M-4 money supply, measured as liquid assets in publichands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January andcompared with this year's eight pct target.

"The policy is proving counter-productive andrates will have to come down in the long-term," the bankspokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries.

ANZ BANK SAYS IT WILL CUT AUSTRALIAN PRIME TO 18.25 PCT FROM 18.5 ON  The president of Japan's biggest hightechnology firm, NEC Corp <NIPN.T>, is anything but worried,despite growing anti-Japanese protectionism, a soaring yen, anda stagnant world electronics market.    "The company's structure was developed by looking ahead,"Tadahiro Sekimoto told Reuters in an interview.    "We assumed the era of a strong yen, trade friction andglobalisation would arrive, and we moved ahead on that basis.There's no need to change our strategy now."    However, the world's largest manufacturer of microchips,the tiny silicon wafers which are the brains of most hightechnology products, knows it must keep looking ahead if it isto survive.    Hoping to build on existing strengths, NEC is now turningits focus on home electronics, an area of past weakness,Sekimoto said.    NEC wants to follow its corporate slogan "C and C" (Computersand Communications) to create high level home electronics thatgo beyond mere televisions and video tape recorders, Sekimotosaid.    Home electronics accounted for only eight pct of NEC'stotal 2,334.67 billion yen sales on a consolidated basis in theyear ended March 31, 1986.    Industry analysts say NEC is wise to target what will be amajor growth market in the future, but some warn the companyfaces some stiff competition.    "This is where the market is going to be for a long time --in products that combine personal computers, video display andtelecommunications networks," said Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltdanalyst Carole Ryavec. "But Matsushita (Electric Industrial CoLtd) may be there first."    But Sekimoto argues that NEC's overall strengths will carrythe day.    "Many companies are in the top 10 in computers or microchipsor telecommunications, but none is in the top 10 in all three.NEC is unique in that respect," he said.    To help its already high rankings, NEC will furtherincrease the high level of offshore production which makes itone of the most multinational of Japan's electronics firms.    The company will increase offshore output of all goods itsells overseas to 50 pct from a current 25 pct over the nextseveral years, Sekimoto said.    But the firm plans to go it alone in expanding overseas,despite moving last year to become joint owner, along withFrance's Cie des Machines Bull <BULP.P>, of U.S. Firm HoneywellInc's <HON> Information Systems unit.    "We hope to increase our share in the U.S. Market throughthe Honeywell tie-up. But our basic strategy is to take anindependent and autonomous route," said Sekimoto.    The company also plans to maintain its independent line bycontinuing to make computers which are not compatible withthose of International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, he said.    "Among the Japanese competitors, only NEC hasn't been caughtin software copyright disputes with IBM and our profits andmarket share have gradually expanded," Sekimoto said.    Once new ways of linking non-compatible computers areperfected, IBM compatibility will be irrelevant. "What willmatter is the best hardware, the best software and the bestability to meet customers needs," Sekimoto said.    In fact, NEC, which has over half of Japan's personalcomputer market, may go to court to stop competitors sellingcheaper machines which can run NEC software but infringecopyright on its operating system, an NEC spokesman said.    While industry analysts give NEC high marks for lookingahead, they note that it failed in forecasting microchipdemand. Like other Japanese chipmakers, the firm was left withserious excess capacity when lean years followed the boomtimes.    But after two years of cutbacks in capital investment inthe sector, Sekimoto thinks the time has come to boost spendingagain, if only slightly.    "We're not going to increase production. But we are going toinvest in new product development and upgrade existing plant,"he said.    Despite NEC's admitted strengths, analysts note the companyfaces tough times due to stagnant markets.    "NEC has excellent worldwide capacity and technology, butthey are caught in a downturn which may last a long time," saidSalamon's Ryavec.    The company forecasts such troubles will slash parent netprofits to 30 billion yen in the year ending March 31, 1987,down 43 pct from the previous year, although sales are expectedto rise eight pct to 2,130 billion yen.    Profits will improve only slightly next year, rising to 38billion yen on sales of 2,350 billion, it said. REUTER
 Top discount rate at U.K. Bill tender rises to 9. Sports carmaker Dr. Ing. H.C.F.Porsche AG <PSHG.F> said it expects to post a satisfactoryprofit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower butU.S. Sales anticipated higher.    Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic saleswere expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000from 28,670 last year.    Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Lastmonth the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86.    For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume thisyear to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254,Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit werebased on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, headded.    The expected drop in West German sales this year would bethe result of the so-called "grey market" for Porsche cars, hesaid. When the dollar was strong against the mark, manyPorsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegalexport to the U.S.    Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period.    The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a largerpercentage of overall sales this year than before does not poseproblems for profit, the Porsche board said.    In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same timePorsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki.    Branitzki put Porsche's hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mlnmarks.    In a speech to the annual meeting, Schutz said third-partyorders placed with Porsche's engineering research centre inWeissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year forthe first time.

CITIBANK SAYS IT RAISES BASE RATE TO 7-3/4 PCT FROM 7 GAF Corp chairman Samuel Heyman toldReuters he did not foresee major changes in Borg-Warner <BOR>if GAF's 46 dlr-per-share offer to acquire Borg-Warner issuccessful.    "We have great respect for Borg-Warner mangagement," Heymansaid, following a speech at the American Institute of ChemicalEngineers annual meeting. "We don't have any particular changesin mind."    Earlier today, GAF announced that a 3.16-billion-dlr-offerwas presented to the board of directors of the Chicago-basedcompany.    Last week, GAF had purchased additional shares of thecompany for 40-1/8 dlrs, increasing its stake in Borg-Warner to19.9 pct.    In 1985, GAF made an unsuccessful effort to acquire UnionCarbide Corp for five billion dlrs, and has since expressed aninterest in acquiring a chemical company that would complementits own chemical business.    When asked whether GAF would consider selling thenon-chemical assets of Borg-Warner if its takeover offer isaccepted, Heyman declined to comment.    He also refused to say whether GAF would considerincreasing its the dollar value of its takeover offer if theinitial proposal is rejected.    Heyman emphasized that he considered the GAF offer toBorg-Warner to be a friendly one.    "We think we made a fair offer that is good for Borg-Warnermanagement and good for its shareholders," Heyman said.     In his speech, Heyman said he feared too many chemicalcompanies were attempting to specialize in the same high marginniche products.    He said they were turning their backs on core commoditychemical businesses.     Heyman said the chemical industry has taken a total ofseven billion dlrs in pre-tax writeoffs during the past twoyears to trim balance sheets.    He predicted that the U.S. chemical industry, whichreported a total of 13 billion dlrs in 1986 profits, would seea 20 pct gain in earnings this year because of increasingexports, cheaper feedstock costs and the weakened U.S. dlr.

CHASE MANHATTAN RAISES PRIME RATE TO 7-3/4 PCT FROM 7-1/2, EFFECTI Pacific Gas and Electric Co saidit expects to record a 470 mln dlr, or 1.25 dlr per share,reduction in 1987 earnings because of the company's decision tochange the method used to record Diablo Canyon Nuclear PowerPlant revenues.    The accounting change will not affect the company's cashposition and the company intends to continue paying itsdividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share.    Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or2.60 dlrs per share.    Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted bydelays in the receipt of a California Public UtilitiesCommission decision on the company's 1984 application for raterelief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructingunits one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project.    It said the commission is currently allowing the company torecover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants.    As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each monthas deferred non-cash account receivable, which has beenincluded in current income.    But the accounting change, effective January 1, willreflect only cash received through interim rates approved bythe commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said.    It also said the commission is now awaiting its PublicStaff Division's report which will recommend how much of the5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed torecover in rates.    The company further stated that it is confident it willreceive an objective review of the facts.    It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates.    Pacific Gas began construction of the two nuclear powerunits in 1969. After a number of construction delays, unit onewent into operation in May 1985 and unit two went on line inMarch last year.

ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U.S. PRIME RATE Quarter-point prime rate increases to7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will befollowed by other banks only after they see clearer signs ofthe Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said.    "Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and theprime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, butno rush is likely," said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.    Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed byChase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.    McCulley said that once the spread between three-monthcertificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a primerate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.    However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until theysee what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the nearterm, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like tofollow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when bankslifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discountrate increase in April of that year.    Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate sincelast August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pctshortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to thecurrent 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.    "The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. Thereshould be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct," said David Jones of Aubrey G.Lanston and Co.    Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today'smeeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed maywell foster higher interest rates soon.    Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policychange today, it may have decided to apply slight upward ratepressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heatup or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.    "The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend totighten policy when they did today's coupon pass," said JosephLiro of S.G. Warburg and Co.    In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, theFed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system byoffering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds forits own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a "pass."    "The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policychange," said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean WitterReynolds Inc.     She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and theprime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is notreally narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rateincrease.    The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise"may have been less a response to interest rates than anattempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line."    Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans todeveloping countries, large money center banks with heavyexposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate inan effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.    The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight moneyto one another could help determine how many banks match thehigher prime rate and also how quickly they move.    In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost offunds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federalfunds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.      The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflectingdemand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and theclose of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between fiveand 6-3/4 pct.    Once the special distortions end, analysts said the fundsrate probably will return to its recent trading level in the6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.    But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to manythat the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates tohelp the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly. Reuter
H.K. BANKS TO RAISE PRIME RATES SOON, DEALERS SAY Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raiseprime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following aone-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banksyesterday, dealers said.    They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase atthis weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association ofBanks.    G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, saidprime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.    Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2pct, the level at beginning of 1987.    The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from fivepct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 onJanuary 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kongdollar, he said.

Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect thegovernment's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and helpimprove world competitiveness of Indian goods.    There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank depositsby long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will createthe flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equityshares or short-term bank deposits, they said.    A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs dueto lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.    Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange,opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closingof 1,012.50 rupees.    A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic nowto buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because theFinance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively.    "But overall debenture prospects remain bright because therates of interest on them will still be higher than what bankspay for deposits of similar maturity," a merchant banker said. REUTER
H.K. BANKS TO RAISE PRIME RATES SOON, DEALERS SAY Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raiseprime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following aone-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banksyesterday, dealers said.    They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase atthis weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association ofBanks.    G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, saidprime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.    Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2pct, the level at beginning of 1987.    The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from fivepct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 onJanuary 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kongdollar, he said.    The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today,with three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct againstyesterday's five to 4-13/16 close. The overnight rate, however,fell to 3-1/2 to three pct from 4-1/2 to four because ofincreased liquidity for a local stock issue. REUTER
LOWER INTEREST RATES SEEN FOLLOWING IRISH BUDGET Financial markets welcomed publicspending cuts announced by Ireland's new minority government inits budget, saying the move would lead to lower interest rates.    Finance Minister Ray MacSharry, making cuts across theboard, reduced the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement to 1.85billion punts, 10.7 pct of GNP, compared with 2.15 billionpunts or 13 pct of GNP last year.

U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - PRIME RATE The prospect that other banks willfollow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raisingtheir prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the creditmarkets today, economists said.    Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two daysof heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market byannouncing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.    Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar- the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on thenews.    Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in theEuromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.    Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fearsof a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, buteconomists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whosepolicy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets thisweek, is already tightening its grip on credit.    "The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting thebanking system's reserve needs this statement period, but Iwouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data," saidJeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

AUSTRIAN BANKS DIVIDED OVER INTEREST RATE CUT Calls for a cut in Austrian interestrates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are dividedover the issue.    Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse undKommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half apercentage point in interest rates across the board. But HannesAndrosch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> toldReuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.    Vak told a news conference that last January's cut inlending rates for commercial customers and for all depositorsby a quarter point had been insufficient.    The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering ofits discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with asimilar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct anddeposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.    Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the GenossenschaftlicheZentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of apoint, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.    Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. Awidening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West Germancredit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growththis year also justified a further interest drop, he said.    Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank deroesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called forlower deposit rates but said lending rates should remainunchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small,particularly when compared with other West European countries.    But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste OesterreichischeSpar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unlessWest German rates came down first.    Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower ratesalone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcomingopposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank. REUTER

The new computers, which mark the first major overhaul ofthe IBM PC line since the company entered the business in 1981,include a PC based on the Intel Corp <INTC> 80386microprocessor, making it the most powerful IBM PC to date.    Also included is an Intel 8086 based system which IBM saidis up to two and a half times as fast as its IBM PC XT model.    IBM also introduced two new versions of its PC AT system.These use an Intel 80286 chip running at 50 pct faster than theexisting IBM PC AT.    The new line of PC's, which IBM calls the PersonalSystem/2, uses 3.5 inch diskettes instead of the conventional5.25 inch diskettes.    The company said the smaller diskettes store from two tofour times more data than larger diskette, which typicallyhandle 360 kilobytes of data.    IBM said the new PC AT's and the 80386-based PC use a newIBM-designed 32-bit data bus. This carries data internallywithin the PC.    The company said the new bus offers processing power up totwo to three-and-a-half times the existing IBM PC AT.    IBM said the new PC's can run a new operating system,called IBM DOS Version 3.3, which is now available.    The company also said it will offer a second operatingsystem, called IBM Operating System/2, developed jointly withMicrosoft Corp <MSFT>. This will be available in stages,beginning in the first quarter of 1988.

This system, which isscheduled for availability in the second quarter, lists at5,295 dlrs with a 44MB fixed disk drive and 6,295 dlrs on the70MB fixed disk drive.    The company said the Personal System/2 80 is the mostpowerful member of the new family of PC's, using an Intel80386-based mocroprocessor. The floor-standing machine will beavailable in three configurations.    IBM said one Model 80 configuration, scheduled for Julyavailability at a cost of 6,995 dlrs, runs at 16 MHz, contains1MB of memory and features a 44MB fixed disk drive.    A second configuration, also scheduled for July at 8,495dlrs each, runs at 16 MHz and has 2MB of memory and a 70MBfixed disk drive.

LITTLE SCOPE FOR U.S. RATE RISE - FANNIE MAE<FNM> There is little scope for a substantialincrease in U.S. interest rates during 1987, said FederalNational Mortgage Association chairman David Maxwell.    Speaking to the New York Financial Writers' Association,Maxwell said he viewed this week's rise in U.S. banks' prime rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct as a temporary phenomenon.    "I don't see a substantial rise in rates this year. Ifanything, the Federal Reserve is more likely to ease than totighten (monetary policy) because so many sectors of theeconomy are showing weakness," Maxwell said. Fannie Mae buysmortgages from lenders and issues mortgage-backed securities.    Maxwell said restructuring of Fannie Mae over the last twoyears had limited its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Aone pct rise in rates in 1987 would cost shareholders about 18cts a share versus one dlr a share in 1981, he said.    Maxwell also questioned the view that housing crowds outother sectors of the economy from obtaining needed capital.    "There's no evidence that housing is crowding firms out ofthe long-term debt market," he said. Both home mortgage debtand long-term corporate debt grew at about equal annual ratesof about 13 pct in 1986 -- a year when mortgage originations of442 billion dlrs needed record housing capital, he said.

ANZ BANK IN N.Z. RAISES INDICATOR LENDING RATE The Australia and New Zealand BankingGroup Ltd in New Zealand said it will raise its indicatorlending rate to 23 pct from 21.5 pct on April 7.    A bank statement said the continuing rise in the cost offunds had to be passed on to the lending customers.    ANZ managing director Brian Weeks said: "Recent developmentsin the money markets are of deep concern to all participants... Market participants are understandably nervous and cautiousabout future developments.    These include flows to and from the government relating tothe privatisation of seven government departments on April 1.    "We welcome the flexibility evident in the Reserve Bank'smove to raise the system cash target yesterday, but feel thatto reduce the present nervousness the cash target and primaryliquidity level need to be raised further...," he said.    The Reserve Bank has raised its daily cash target to 45 mlnN.Z. Dlrs from its normal 30 mln dlrs.    Call rates have traded as high as 65 pct this week becauseof business year-end March 31 balance date book squaring.

BELGIUM CUTS TREASURY CERTIFICATE RATES The Belgian National Bank cut interestrates on one, two and three-month treasury certificates to 7.30pct from 7.40 pct effective immediately, the bank said in atelex message.    The Bank last adjusted its short-term treasury certificaterates on March 23, when it also reduced rates for all threeperiods by 0.10 points.    A National Bank spokesman said the latest adjustment wouldbring the rates closer in line with currently prevailinginterbank interest rates.    The spokesman said it was too early to predict whether themove would herald a reduction in discount rate, which currentlystands at eight pct, when the Bank holds its regular weeklymeeting at which the rate is discussed next Wednesday.    The discount rate generally moves in tandem with thethree-month treasury certificate rate. However, there is noformal link and the discount rate was not adjusted followingthe March 23 changes.

TOP DISCOUNT RATE AT UK BILL TENDER RISES TO 9. The departure of James Baker'sclosest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, willnot change the course of Washington's domestic andinternational economic policies, U.S. officials said.    Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, waswidely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives oncurrency management and international economic cooperation.    U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role inshepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan throughthe U.S. Congress.    But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure,to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers,signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the TreasurySecretary himself might leave soon.    "It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as itcame up," one official said.    Another commented, "Baker will miss him, but he's not goingto stand in his way."    There has been widespread speculation since last autumnthat Darman sought a Wall Street job.    Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform latelast year marked an appropriate moment to bow out.    Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed.    "Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of thisadministration over the past six years and his departurerepresents a substantial loss," he said.    U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be anundoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policyadvice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term,at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as"indispensable" to Baker.    Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currencysystem and Darman is generally credited by officials of othernations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouringtarget zones to limit currency fluctuations.    Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasuryunsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system.    But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, withDarman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives.    Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council,spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating withthe Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before.    Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as apolitical strategist "and that's Baker's strength too," theofficial said.    There were already indications that Baker, who throughouthis time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle ofadvisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor.    One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould,who holds the number three Treasury position ofUnder-Secretary.    Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years.    Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was apartner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerlyheaded Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.    The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annualmeetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated.    He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement,when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britaincurbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turningpoint in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economiccooperation and intervention in currency markets.    Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, likethe Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination ofeconomic policies among the leading industrial countries andthe recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies andstimulate global growth.    These policies are collectively aimed at redressing thehuge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses andthe United State's massive trade deficit.    That policy goal still remains a prime objective of theReagan Administration and will not change with Darman'sdeparture. REUTER

WOJNILOWER SEES DROP IN U.S. INTEREST RATES The Federal Reserve will promote lowerinterest rates this year to sustain world economic growth,First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.    As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line againstinflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit withoutsubverting national U.S. economic policy.    "On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,because the trade deficit is not responding, the United Statesdecided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet theircommitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do itspart by moving rates down," Wojnilower said in a report.    "Justifiably not anticipating either a recession orseriously higher interest rates, securities market participantshave seen little to fear," Wojnilower said.    He said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency ratesand bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanesewindow dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.    Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-averageeconomic growth in the first quarter.

LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interestrates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.    Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Sevencountries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he saidcentral banks would continue to intervene "as and whennecessary."    He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do moreto stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined byJapanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.    Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of asimultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and WestGermany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budgetspeech to the British Parliament.    "If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there isstill a risk," he said.    Asked if the United States should consider increasinginterest rates to support the dollar, he said, "If there is aneed for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need tobe a rise in interest rates in the United States."    Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday'smeetings at the slow progress the United States had made inreducing its budget deficit.    "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress inreducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that itcontinue year after year," Lawson said.    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts tostabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the sixweeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise againstthe dollar despite massive central bank intervention.    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness inthe Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had beenno intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawsonsaid, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode... but one has to be vigilant."    He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that"current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been"carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean thesame thing," he said.    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanesemeasures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source ofweakness for that agreement.    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa'spresentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulatedomestic demand.    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediateincrease in public works spending, but Lawson said the packagealso involved a second stage to increase expenditures duringthe second half of this year.

JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE Bank of Japan sources said the bankhas no plans to cut its discount rate.    They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japanduring the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lowerits discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feelany need for a cut at all.    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reportersearlier today that some countries - those with strongcurrencies - might have to cut interest rates.    The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon tocall the G-7 pact a failure.    The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar'srenewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked byremarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that thedollar's fall had been orderly.    They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker'scomments because he was referring to the dollar's fall sincethe Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,not the currency's recent movements.    They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seizeon anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way orthe other.    The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting moreweight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging marketstability than on other currencies.    Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangersthat would arise from a further dollar fall because it wouldreduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting theU.S. And world economies, they said.    In February and in March of this year, Japanese investorsreduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sourcessaid.    Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view aboutcurrency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.    This is because the overall foreign exchange market is atriangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen anddollar/European currencies.    At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries didnot want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they didnot object to the yen strengthening, they said. REUTER

U.S. SENATE LEADER CALLS FOR INTEREST RATE CUTS Senate Finance Committee ChairmanLloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) called on major industrial countries tomake a pledge at the coming economic summit in Venice to cutinterest rates.    "I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to betrying to do is to get the other major industrial nations thatare involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,"Bentsen told NBC Television's "Meet the Press."    Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take "billions offthe debt service of the Latin countries" and help easeprotectionist pressures in the industrial countries.    Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured torevalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.    "You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus,enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperationthere," he said.    Departing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told thesame television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had notfallen enough against the currencies of some countries.    "I think that more does have to be done there innegotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs(newly industrialized countries)," he said.    Darman said such negotiations with newly industrializedcountries were underway privately.    Bentsen predicted Congress and the White House would agreeon a fiscal 1988 budget that would raise between 18 and 22billion dlrs in new revenues.    The Texas senator said a series of excise taxes would beconsidered by Congress, including an extension of the telephonetax and new levies on liquor and cigarettes.    Bentsen said he supported an oil import fee, but that itwould not happen without President Reagan's support.    Darman called for a "top level negotiation" between the WhiteHouse and Congress on a budget compromise that would includeasset sales, some excise taxes, cuts in middle-classentitlement programs, "a reasonable, steady rate of growth indefense" and reform of the budget process.

BUDGET CHIEF MILLER WARNS FED ON INTEREST RATES White House Budget chief JamesMiller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might"overreact" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar byraising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recessionnext year.    "Our greatest danger is overreaction," Miller told newspaperreporters yesterday. "I'm concerned about the Fed'soverreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent datashowing a substantial fall in the money supply."    Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, publishedin the New York Times today, were accurate.    Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact tosignals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move hesaid could have "political consequences."    The White House budget chief appeared to be referring tothe effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidentialand congressional elections next year.    "My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deepsoup, and there is no question about it," he said.    Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower taxrevenues and a widening of the budget deficit.    Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. centralbank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means ofbolstering the dollar.    Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal ReserveBoard Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that furtherdeclines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardizeglobal growth prospects.    U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany tostimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move thatcould boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionistpressures in the United States.

UAE TO RECOGNISE CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATES A top United Arab Emirates (UAE)banker said a new law would be introduced soon obliging courtsto recognise interest rates contracted between bank andborrower.

U.K. BANKERS CONSIDER NEW ECGD FINANCING PLAN Representatives of major U.K. Based banksare meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing thecost of financing British exports guaranteed by the ExportCredits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sourcessaid.    The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGDand the Bank of England.    Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment onthe plan. However, bankers said one of the main points underdiscussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's mediumterm credit portfolio in the international capital markets.    The proposals involve introducing a set of interest marginson ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the sizeand maturity of the credit and the currency.    The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankerssaid that while these rates would reduce a bank's return theywould still be more than those proposed about a year ago whenthe government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate anothercost reduction plan.    At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow theECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existinggovernment backed credit in the capital markets.    On credits that are refinanced an original lender wouldreceive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mlnstg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions. REUTER
Tokyo - Bundesbank's Schlesinger sees no reason to lower intere Bundesbank vice president HelmutSchlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.    With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down inMay and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that afurther cut in interest rates was needed.    The economy is picking up, after contracting by aseasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter fromthe fourth, he added. "We may have an increase in gnp startingin the second quarter," he said in an interview.    Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has beenpressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost itsimports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.    Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter wasmainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.    He estimated that economic growth for the year as a wholewould probably be between one and two pct.   "It is not a question of monetary conditions if domesticdemand does not grow strongly," he said, noting that interestrates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.    Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank moneystock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year paceof 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to sixpct target.    He said the target could still be achieved but much willdepend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavyinflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMSrevaluation, boosted domestic money supply.    "There is still a certain hope that the net inflow offoreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bitreversed," Schlesinger said.    A major reason for the inflows was the market's convictionthat the mark was headed higher. "As we can see from the market,expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark havediminished," Schlesinger said.    The recent widening of interest rate differentials, thefact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short periodand an improvement in real trade balances have all combinedtowards stabilizing the dollar, he said.    Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollarrise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.    At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.    "Central banks are always in contact about thesefluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,"Schelsinger said.    "One has to look at how it (the market) is moving," he said,adding, "It is not only our own case, it is also the Americancase."    He said that the West German export industry has been hithard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to seesome correction now. "But it wouldn't be good to have short-termfluctuations," he said. "Let us wait and see."    "It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a veryshort period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level(of rates) as such," Schlesinger said.    The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices ofsuch key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on WestGerman inflation down year.    Although there have recently been signs of inflationpicking up, he said that this was due to changes in keycommodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year wouldbe unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.    Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growthwas longer term, in that the economy was building up thepotential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.    The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness oftargets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at themid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.    But he added: "I don't see any great pressure to go awayfrom it." REUTER

Nakasone, Sumita agree discount rate cut not appropriate now - central bank The World Bank's policies prevent it fromlending money for the transfer of land from landowners to thelandless, but it can help finance development of thePhilippines' proposed land reform program, a bank officialsaid.    "The World Bank by its established policies cannot use itsresources to finance the transfer of assets from one group toanother. Our mandate is to finance investment-relatedactivities," Rolando Arrivillaga, the bank's residentrepresentative in the Philippines, told Reuters in aninterview.    Arrivillaga said he wanted to clarify part of a report by aWorld Bank mission that came in March to review the land reformprogram and which said the bank would not be able to financecompensation payments for the transfer of land.    He said the Philippine government had never asked the bankto finance land transfers, and the bank's position should notbe taken to mean that it ruled out any lending for the program.    "Clearly in the case of land reform the question of landtransfer by definition is transferring assets from the landedto the landless," Arrivillaga said. "However, the bank as aninstitution can finance the development aspects of the program."    "We will deal with the part of the program that deals withhow to put the land to effective use once it has beentransferred and how to make the on-farm investments that areneeded to attain the goal of improving the income level of thebeneficiaries," Arrivillaga said.    "I wouldn't be surprised if other multilateral institutionsare faced with similar constraints," he said.    President Corazon Aquino's spokesman said last week thatshe was committed to launching the program, which limits landholdings to seven hectares, by using her sweeping powers ofrule by decree before a new Congress convenes in July.    Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said the land reformprogram, estimated to cost about 44 billion pesos, would beimplemented in four phases and benefit 2.64 mln farmers.    Benigno said the first two phases would complete thetransfer of rice and corn lands and abandoned farmland as wellas the transfer of land sequestered, expropriated or foreclosedby the government and would cover 1.15 mln hectares.    But Aquino would not decree the redistribution of largesugar, banana and coconut plantations, leaving it to theCongress to work out the details, Benigno said.    Arrivillaga said bilateral aid donors, who form part of aconsultative group led by the World Bank, might be prepared tofinance the land transfers.    "I don't think there are fast and easy rules as to howinternational sources of finance would behave in a situationlike this, because land reform by its very nature requires richfinancing to be able to carry out the reform in a way equitableto both the landowner and the beneficiary," he said.    Arrivillaga said the first priority for the governmentwould be to tap domestic sources of financing for the landtransfer, but external assistance could be brought in if therewere gaps.    "In such a fundamental reform the test of the willingness ofthe government is how it confronts the domestic resourcerequirement," Arrivillaga said. "Multilateral agencies by theirvery nature are lenders of last resort. It means they have tobe convinced that the government prioritises the program."    He said the World Bank had financed developmental costsunder an earlier land reform program launched by formerPresident Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, and such aid had beenchannelled through the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).    The LBP is the main implementing agency under Aquino'sprogram.    "If asked to do so again and the program is designed toimprove the standard of living of the poor then we wouldcertainly be prepared to consider (lending)," Arrivillaga said.    He said the tendency in such programs was to exaggerate thecosts by presenting ten-year perspectives in a one-yearcontext.    Arrivillaga said the government could solve most of itsfinancing problems by devising effective instruments tocompensate landowners.

U.K. CENTRAL BANK WARNS OF EXCESSIVE RATE CUTS Bank of England governor RobinLeigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast couldjeopardise recent economic achievements in the U.K.    In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen inBirmingham, he said prospective returns on real investment aremore favourable, relative to those on financial assets, thanfor a good number of years.    "It would surely be foolish to put that favourableconjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely orexcessively," he said.    "We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity, but at therisk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony ofhigh inflation," he added.    Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who wouldargue that interest rates are still too high and deterinvestment in industry.    "But we should not forget that less than a year ago we wereintervening to support sterling and had some temporarydifficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase inbase rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy atthe time," he added.

U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyersfixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makesthe same monthly payment no matter what happens to otherinterest rates.    And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels inyears, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyerstrying to lock into cheap money.    The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officialssaid, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the homemortgage business.    While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., Theywere the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only afew years ago.    But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as lowas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in theirportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct toinduce them to retain their accounts.    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or wereforced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whoserates would move in line with the cost of funds.    "We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,"said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,explaining why his institution, for the time being, is onlyoffering variable rate mortgages.    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helpedhomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lendersconcede they are being forced to undercut each other stillmore.    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlierthis week by the nation's two largest building societies and byNational Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition fornew business, officials at all three institutions said.    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates evenbelow those on the variable rate loans.    "Of course they are less profitable than other (variablerate) mortgages," said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, whichearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed ratenew mortgage loans.    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitableloans because, "It was just another way to attract people to ourmortgage product."    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixedrate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans wasexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.    "Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage," she said, notingthat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pctof its 1986 volume.    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that theyoffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interestrates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made thelender is earning an above average return on assets.    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has wonthe benefit of cheap money.    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixedrate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumptionthat a Conservative Party victory would help money market ratesfall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.    Young explained that the company had planned to protectitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying acomplicated hedging instrument.    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectationsand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. Hesaid money market rates were too high to arrange both themortgages and hedge profitably.    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co doesmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. Thismeans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bondand selling them to an investor.    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and moreefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating ratemortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popularagain, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage moneyover the past few years. REUTER
UPTREND REMAINS INTACT FOR DEBT FUTURES The six basis point rise of the pastmonth in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by aseries of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as thedollar holds firm.    "Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basispoints over the last month, largely over indications thatinflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowingU.S. trade balance, in nominal terms," Samuel Kahan, chieffinancial economist with Kleinwort Benson GovernmentSecurities, said.    Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength inthe economy during the first quarter, but his concern iswhether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in thelonger term.    Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which hasbecome more important to the direction of debt futures than thebeneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.    The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. ConsumerPrice Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down1.5 pct, respectively.    Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 moneysupply announced this week was "surprising, much larger thanexpected," according to Kahan. "Unless quickly reversed," sucha trend "will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,"Kahan said.    Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates whichKahan said have "slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Boardannual targets," the consequences could be a hint of economicweakness down the road, he said.    Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised forfurther gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,analysts said.    September T-bonds "are up almost six points since about May18," Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. Septemberbond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93in mid-June, Duggan said.    While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide throughchart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwartedabove the 93 level.    "The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be takenout before this activity is anything other than a trading rangemarket," Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analystBrian Singer said.    The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.    "The critical variable remaining in the market is the valueof the dollar," Kahan said.    Additional influences next week will be possibledevelopments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impactand size of the U.S. budget deficit, "although these will notbe in the forefront of the market early next week," Kahan said.    In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refundingauctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday andThursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the resultswith little excitement. However, a successful auction couldprove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing marketpsychology. Reuter

BANK OF JAPAN DETERMINED TO KEEP EASY MONEY POLICY The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yenin certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreementstoday to show its determination to maintain an easy moneypolicy, central bank officials said.

The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-monthcommercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in theinterbank market today, the officials said.    The central bank was concerned about growing marketexpectations of higher interest rates, which were in partresponsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,the officials said.    But money traders said the market generally shrugged offthe bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate farbelow prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-monthCDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bidwas 3.75 pct, they said.    The bank's bill buying operation also had little impactbecause it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.    The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CDbuying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan'spledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.    "We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit gripany further," a bank manager said, adding that the prevailingmarket expectation of higher rates will remain.

POEHL SPEAKS AGAINST GERMAN INTEREST RATE CUT Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl saidWest Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates andthat he believed the economy would continue to recover after asix-month lull.    Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interestrates could boost the domestic economy, Poehl said: "We would bebadly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.    "This could, under certain circumstances, release newinflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead tohigher interest rates," he added.    Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the pastsix months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.    "But since April, statistics clearly show that the economyfinds itself on a course of growth," he said. "I expect thisdevelopment to continue in the coming months."    Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Communitytrade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous.

U.S. TO END NETHERLANDS ANTILLES TAX TREATY The Treasury Department said itnotified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles andAruba.    The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasurysaid in a two-sentence announcement.    The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiationsbetween the United States and the Netherlands over the pasteight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesmansaid.    The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies ofEurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will nolonger be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, thespokesman said.    Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most havematurities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, thespokesman said.    He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have anadverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the generaldecline in interest rates means they will be able to refinanceat lower interest rates.    However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be facedwith lower yields. Reuter

POEHL SAYS RATE RISES ARE CAUSE FOR CONCERN Rises in West German and internationalinterest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank hasno interest in higher capital market rates, BundesbankPresident Karl Otto Poehl said.    "We consider the interest rate increase that has occurredhere and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,"Poehl told an investment conference.    "I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interestin higher capital market rates," he said.    Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced atender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80pct.    Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate haveseen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pctat last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender inlate September.    The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injectionsof money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.    These moves to cap interest rates followed a meetingbetween Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.    Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmedtheir commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening inWest German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of thedollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.    But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting innervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.    Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was notdue to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, andcurrency developments.    Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said "Youhave to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue apolicy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears." The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, hesaid.    Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution tointernational cooperation in interest and monetary policy.    The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its moneysupply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.    "Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interestrates have risen substantially more," Poehl said.    This had to be taken into account when considering recentrises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due torising international money market rates that had spilled overinto the German market, he said.    Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so farignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.    "The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance isdefinitely underway," he said, noting that this was not sonoticeable in absolute figures.    The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had alsoattracted little attention, he said. REUTER
TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY Plunging Tokyo stock prices will preventthe Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could evenforce it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,government and private economists said.    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to sparkfurther selling of shares that could ultimately have a majordeflationary impact on the real economy, they said.    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistentlymaintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discountrate, many in the markets have thought otherwise.     Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by thecentral bank's apparent decision last week to countenancehigher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed toraise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about arenewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as themarkets concluded that the stock market's collapse precludedthe central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discountrate increase.    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent afurther drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. "They need tosupport the stock and security markets," he said.    But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to changepolicy for the moment, although one admitted that the centralbank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock pricescontinue to plunge during the rest of the week.    Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed theeconomy is better placed now to cope with the deflationaryimpact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.    With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop instock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer andbusiness confidence, one government economist said.    "There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won'tbe that big," said another.    Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on theirown, although they do participate through trust funds and otherinvestment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turnedto financial market investments for profits during last year'seconomic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them torefocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.    Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that ispartly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies haveshifted funds away from financial investments to increaseinventories and step up capital spending, one governmenteconomist said.    In deciding what response to make to the steep stock pricedrop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether priceswill continue to fall further and then decide if they pose agreater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,one central bank official said. "That will at least take acouple of days, if not weeks," he said. REUTER

The reduction is effective immediately.    No other major U.S. bank had followed the lead of Chemicaland Marine Midland, preferring to keep their prime rates at9-1/4 pct while they waited to see what course money marketrates would take.    Following Monday's record fall in Wall Street stock prices,money market rates fell sharply on Tuesday as investorsploughed proceeds into short-term instruments and the FederalReserve said it is prepared to provide liquidity to support theeconomy and the financial system.    Eurodollar deposit rates in London fell by as much as 9/16percentage point, Treasury bill rates fell by as much as half apoint (after falling between 59 and 84 basis points on Monday),and the Fed funds rate dropped to 7-1/4 pct from Monday'saverage of 7.61 pct. Speculation even surfaced of a discountrate cut to calm the markets, dealers said. Reuter
U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stgsurge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely tonudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy aslong as sterling remains in its present robust state,economists said.    An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over thepast two days will in any case subdue personal consumer creditdemand which has largely been behind growth in lending.    "In the normal course of events the markets would have beenextremely worried about that figure," noted Peter Spencer, U.K.Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.    After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,which compared won stg August rise, U.K.Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to fleefrom plummetting equities into the relative security ofgovernment securities.    Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching aday's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tonethroughout.    U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morningafter little more than a token blip as the figures came out.    Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by bankswould under other circumstances have prompted market fears of arise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, "Withthe financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the lastthing the Bank of England would want to do," Spencer said.    "The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long assterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,"said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell MontaguGilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow moneymeasure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pctgrowth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.    But "The fact that overall broad money growth has sloweddown is a rather encouraging sign," noted Paul Temperton, U.K.Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to afall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad moneyaggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.    It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bankof England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base ratesto 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently bynews of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.    Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry inthat period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.    Housing and equities were the key two asset markets ininfluencing consumer behaviour, he said.    In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equitymarkets in the past few days, "There will almost certainly be astraightforward impact on consumer spending and on retailsales," Temperton said.    "Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth inconsumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues," he added.    "I think the stock market has decided that the bank lendingfigure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a veryserious panic and a flight to quality," Spencer said.    A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to lookat all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowlythan bank lending.    Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lendingwas evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavypersonal sector borrowing.    Figures from the Banking Information Service showedpersonal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Muchof the rise reflected quarterly interest payments. REUTER

DONALD REGAN SAYS U.S. SHOULD EASE CREDIT SUPPLY Donald Regan, President Reagan'sformer chief of staff, said the government should loosen themoney supply, try to keep interest rates down and try to reducethe federal budget and trade deficits to avoid a recession.    "I think what we have to face now is trying to preserve oureconomy," the one-time chairman of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc<MER> said in an interview on the ABC television network.    "We've got to loosen money, we've got to keep interest ratesdown. We can't afford to let them go up. That means we're goingto have to work on our twin deficits, both the budget deficitand the trade deficit," Regan said.     "I certainly wouldn't tighten money at this particularmoment," Regan said when asked about the prospects for arecession following Monday's price drop on Wall Street.    "I think that if they were to do that, they'd create thesame conditions that we did in '29...They choked off the moneysupply and what happened? We went into a major recession. Ithink that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now."    Regan also called on the government to impose restrictionson program trading. "I think that that's exacerbated,exaggerated this decline, and I think it's something that theymust stop," he said. Reuter

LUX FRANC BOND MARKET STALLED BY BELGIAN CRISIS The thriving market in Luxembourgfranc bond issues has been temporarily stalled by the Belgiangovernment crisis which has put the franc under pressure andforced up interest rates, banking sources said.    On Monday, King Baudouin accepted the resignation ofBelgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens' coalition and askedhim to try to form a new government.    Because of the crisis, Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA(BGL) has delayed a public issue for one billion Luxembourgfrancs, originally scheduled for the end of last week, BGLdirector Robert Sharfe said.    He said the issue would probably go ahead later this week.    It is likely there will be an upward adjustment in interestrates on Luxembourg franc bond private placements, bankingsources said. However, no new placements are scheduled foranother 10 days.    The latest issue last Friday for Swedish Export Credit Corp(SEK) carried a coupon of 7-1/2 pct, whereas in previous issuesthe interest was set lower at 7-3/8 pct.    Interest rates on the Luxembourg franc, which is in paritywith the Belgian franc, are strongly affected by Belgian rates.    On Friday, Belgium increased the rate on three-monthTreasury certificates by 0.5 pct to 7.15 pct as the Belgianfranc came under pressure.    Private placements in Luxembourg francs have becomeincreasingly popular, particularly with Scandivanian borrowers,because they carry a relatively low interest rate.    Private investors also have flocked to buy Luxembourg francbond issues because the franc was seen as a fairly strongcurrency. REUTER
