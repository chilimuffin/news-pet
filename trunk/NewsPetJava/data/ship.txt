VERSATILE TO BUILD POLAR ICE BREAKER Versatile Corp's shipbuilding subsidiaryhas a letter of intent to build a 320 mln dlr polar icebreakerfor the Canadian coast guard, Transport Minister John Crosbiesaid.    In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile PacificShipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial andengineering conditions before the contract is awarded.    The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mlndlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for theconstruction of the vessel.said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will berequired to offer assurances that the shipyard is technicallyand financially capable of performing the work."    Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower thancompeting bidders and will generate 1,000 person years ofdirect employment.    Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the mostpowerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year andcompleted in 1992.    The government announced plans to build the icebreaker lastyear following the controversial passage of the U.S. CoastGuard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed NorthwestPassage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for thejourney, claiming the area was an international water way.    The government said the icebreaker was needed to back upthe country's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic. Reuter

NEITHER SIDE OPTIMISTIC ON ROTTERDAM PORT ISSUES Employers and the port union, FNV, areto meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of thesix-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, butneither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides toldReuters.    Little progress was made in last night's three hours oftalks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions.    "There is still a very large gap between the employers andthe FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement.But at least we are still talking," a union spokesman said.    Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accusedthe FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at allover the past two months.    "The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I amreally not optimistic about it changing its point of view atall."    "If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses toaccept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector,then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may beginlater this month," Schoufour said.    The series of strikes, which employers say has cost themmore than seven mln guilders in lost import business in thepast six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with350 this year.    Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf saidunless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdrawthe sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy.    Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting outtheir cases, but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear fromhim before Wednesday at the earliest. Reuter

TAIWAN SHIPBUILDER LOOKS FOR JAPANESE VENTURES Taiwan's state-owned China ShipbuildingCorp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements withJapan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trimits debts, chairman Louis Lo said.    He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first jointproduction venture, to build two hulls for <Onomichi DockyardCo Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have beenheld with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi HeavyIndustries Co Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima HeavyIndustries Co Ltd <JIMA.T>, he said.    Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twentyfoot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi,which would complete production.    "We expect the successful cooperation between us andOnomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with otherJapanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said.    He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost ofshipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanesetechnology and marketing. This would pose a challenge tocompetitors in Europe and South Korea.    Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrssince beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now standsat about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearlythree mln dlrs.    But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largestshipbuilder, still has full government support and had begundiversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes andother machinery.    "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification,"he said.    Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mlnU.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with theprevious financial year. He estimated income would rise to morethan 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87.    CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 deadweight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 shipsof 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said.    Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at leastuntil 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for shiprepairing was bright. REUTER

ROTTERDAM PORT SUBSIDY TO END JULY 1 - MINISTER Dutch Social Affairs Minister Louw deGraaf announced he is withdrawing the annual 10 mln guilderlabour subsidy for Rotterdam's strike-hit general cargo sectoras from July 1.    Late last month de Graaf said that if the dispute was notsettled by Monday this week he would withdraw the subsidy.    The chairman of the port employers' organization, SVZ,Jacques Schoufour, said he was unhappy with the decision andadded there was now no alternative to proceeding withredundancy plans.    The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19in protest at employers' plans to make 800 redundancies fromthe 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year.    Meanwhile, the port and transport union, FNV, attacked lossfigures given for the port for this year.    The figures, issued by accountants on behalf of the SVZ,put total losses for last year at 34 mln guilders and in 1985at 37 mln. Earlier, the employers had put the figure at around30 mln.    The FNV said the actual losses were nearer 17 to 20 mln andsaid the employers had inflated the figures as part of theirplan to restructure completely the port's general cargo sector. Reuter
STRIKING BRAZILIAN SEAMEN HOLD PAY TALKS Striking Brazilian seamen, who saythey have made idle 158 ships and halted Brazilian exports,today held pay talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labour MinisterAlmir Pazzianotto, union officials said.    Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the NationalMerchant Marine Union, told Reuters he was optimistic the talkswould lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday.    Brazil's 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct.    The union official said the strike had halted a total of158 vessels, including 50 in Brazil's main port, Santos, andabout 50 more in Rio de Janeiro.    Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain,Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said.    Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern tothe government, which has already had to suspend interestpayments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drasticdeterioration in the country's trade balance.    The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, MuriloRubens Habbema, was quoted in today's Gazeta Mercantilnewspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign shipscould be authorized to transport Brazilian exports.    "Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment, and it isnot conceivable that exports be hit," he said.    "But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we aregoing to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad,and all this through the fault of the seamen," Rubens Habbemasaid.    A spokesman for the port of Santos, which has been thescene of labour unrest and congestion in recent months, saidmovement of ships out of the port was running at about half itsnormal level of 12 ships a day.    He said a total of 76 ships were either waiting at anchoron moored in the harbour. Reuter

FERRY DISASTER MAY RANK AMONG WORST TRAGEDIES Fading hope for passengers trapped aboarda partially-sunk Channel ferry raised fears the accident couldrank among this centuries' worst peacetime shipping tragedies.    Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo said there was nohope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in theHerald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgiancoast last night.    If confirmed, the toll would make the incident the world'sworst since a Soviet liner, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided witha freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with theloss of nearly 400 lives. A further 856 people were rescued.    The world's deadliest single peacetime incident at sea wasthe sinking in 1912 of the Titanic with a loss of 1,500 lives.    The second biggest loss of life in peacetime was in 1914when 1,014 people drowned when the liner Empress of Irelandcollided with a freighter on the St Lawrence river in Canada.    The world's worst maritime disaster was in wartime thattook 7,700 lives when the German liner Wilhelm Gustloff wastorpedoed by a Soviet submarine in January 30, 1945.    In 1985, more than 200 were feared dead after two ferriessank near Dhaka, 174 drowned when a ferry capsized in China and147 died when a launch sank off the Malaysian state of Sabah. REUTER

EXPERTS HAD EXPRESSED FEARS OVER RO-RO SAFETY As a British government investigation gotunder way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of FreeEnterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts hadalready been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship.    Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminaryinvestigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferrycapsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred toleave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover.    Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decksthrough the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, TownsendThoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed.    Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to theHerald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not plannedto pull them out of service at present.    "Our investigator is there already. We shall have to waitand see. But it is too early to say what happened," he told BBCradio.    As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submergedhulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubtshad already been expressed about the design of so-called "RoRo"ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise.    In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International MaritimeConsultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-onroll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deckareas divided by bulkheads.    Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West Germanyard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safetystandards.    But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers wouldhave had problems getting off this type of ship because of itsdesign.    Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langleysaid the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects toa barge.    "As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches outof line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship iscompartmentalised and you have more stability," he said.    Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectlystable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level.    "If you do get water into that area then you can get verysevere effects on the stability of the ship," he added. REUTER

FERRY DISASTER CLAIMS COULD TOP 30 MLN STG U.K. Insurers could face more than 30 mlnstg of insurance claims following the Zeebrugge ferry disaster,a spokesman for Lloyds of London said.    It could take weeks before the extent of the compensationclaims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also beforeit was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged,said David Larner of Lloyds.    The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprisewere valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by TownsendThoresen's parent company Peninsular and Oriental SteamNavigation Co Plc <PORL.L>.    The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market withLloyds and various other companies, Larner said.    Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the StandardSteamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of severalshipowners' mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were alsounderwritten by Lloyds and other companies.    Larner said claims from passengers could be expected tototal at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and thenormal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death.    Shipping sources said, however, that these claims couldsoar if a court found there was negligence or design faultsinvolved.    Larner said estimates of compensation claims "were pureguess work" at this time. But if the ship could not be salvaged,the claims would total at least 30 mln stg.

Shipowners have offered a 100 pct raise, which the seamenrejected.    "Television reported that the port was operating at fullspeed, but that's not true," a striking seaman told Reuters.    "The marines are doing their best, but they don't have themanpower nor the experience to control the situation in such aquick period," he said.    Port officials said the national halt had already causedlosses estimated at 1.5 mln dlrs.    Despite the presence of marines, there were no reports ofincidents. Reuter
UNION, SHIPPERS AGREE TO CUT N.Y. PORT COSTS The New York Shipping Association andInternational Longshoremen's Association said they agreed tocut cargo assessments at the Port of New York and New Jersey bymore than 50 pct on some labor intensive cargos.    The charges on cargo handled by union workers will bereduced to 2.85 dlrs a ton from 5.85 dlrs a ton, effectiveApril one, according to the agreement between the union andshippers. The assessments are used to fund workers' benefits.    "What were doing is lowering the price to get more bulkcargo flowing through here," a spokesman for the New YorkShipping Association said.

SEARCH FOR BRITISH FERRY'S TOXIC CARGO CONTINUES The search continued for acargo of poisonous chemical substances loaded on the Herald ofFree Enterprise Ferry which capsized in Zeebrugge harbourFriday.    A total of 72 drums of various toxic materials which wereloaded on trucks in the ship's hold have been recovered, butBelgian authorities warned it was essential to recover afurther 61 containers of a cyanide-based solution.    A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at thefront of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out.    Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside thewreck of the 7,951 ton roll-on, roll-off ferry which now liespartly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour.    The ferry's owner is <European Ferries Plc>, majority ownedby Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc <PORL.L>.    The operation to right the vessel began yesterday afterdivers abandoned their search for more bodies. Experts said itcould take months to refloat the ship and free the 80 bodiesestimated to be trapped amid debris.    "The problem is that in these waters you can normally expectone working day out of four," said Daan Kaakebeen of DutchSalvage experts Smit Tak International of Rotterdam. Heestimated the job itself would require 35 working days.    Using reinforced cables, salvage experts intend to raisethe ship and set it down into a trench dug alongside.    Salvage work could pinpoint the exact cause of the loss ofthe ferry, one of three sister vessels plying cross-Channelroutes from England to continental Europe.    Suspicion at present is focused on the ferry's main vehicleloading doors, set close to water level.    In London, Transport Secretary John Moore told parliamentyesterday that the ship keeled over after water gushed inthrough the bow doors. He said a major government inquiry intothe disaster will be held, all similar ferries sailing fromBritain will be inspected and owners will be asked to fitlights to give warning if bow doors are not properly closed.    Experts carrying out tank and computer tests to determinehow the accident occurred will focus attention on the ship'sdoors, its ballast system and crew procedures, he added.    Two other investigations into the disaster have also begun,one Belgian and one by the ferry's owners. REUTER

STRIKING BRAZIL SEAMEN THREATEN MASS RESIGNATION Striking seamen said they wouldoffer their collective resignation rather than end their13-day-old national strike on management's terms.    The seamen said they were spurred to their decision aftermarines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesdaynight. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to workunder duress.    President Jose Sarney's government despatched troops toBrazil's ports and oil installations on Tuesday.    Seamen in Santos, Brazil's main port, are in defiant mood.One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters thatmost of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignationson Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio deJaneiro said seamen were offering to resign in all thecountry's main ports.    The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a seriousdebt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its tradebalance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get,and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harmthe strike is doing to exports.    An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the ShipownersAssociation read, "The seamen's strike is illegal, irrationaland unpatriotic."    The seamen respond that they cannot live on their presentsalaries. According to officical pay lists available in theunion's office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring theirtotal pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month.    At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzadosa month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados withallowances.     "Brazil's seamen are the second worst paid in the world,after Ghana's," dos Santos said. He said the seamen had notreceived a pay increase since February 1986, and prices havedoubled since then with the collapse of the government'sCruzado Plan price freeze.    Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour MinisterAlmir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve thedispute.

JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS SEEK CARTEL TO RESTRICT OUTPUT Japanese shipbuilders have applied to thestate's Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to restricttonnage built to about half of total capacity for the yearstarting April 1, officials of the Shipbuilders Association ofJapan said.    Under the plan, 33 yards capable of building ships of morethan 10,000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mlncompensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) a year againstcapacity of about six mln CGRT.    The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3.3 mln CGRTin the year to March 1988 and 3.1 mln the following year.    The industry has curtailed production due to oversupplynearly every year since 1977/78, under cartel or TransportMinistry guidelines. The latest guidelines call for a ceilingof four mln CGRT in the year to March 31.    The cartels, self-imposed and self-regulated, are notlegally binding, but industry finds it in its own interest tostick to them.    The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yenand a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump. REUTER

DUTCH PORT EMPLOYERS RESUME LAY-OFF PLANS Employers in Rotterdam's troubledgeneral cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancyprocedures within a week, employers' organisation labourrelations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters.    Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said theemployers' decision would not lead to the immediate resumptionof eight weeks of strikes in the sector.    The strike action was called off on Friday after an interimcourt injunction against the employers' plans for 350redundancies this year.

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY Japan's ailing shipbuilding industryplans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks ofrecession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cutsand greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.    The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsoredrationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of themarket which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Koreathrough currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.    The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pctmore competitive than Japan's due to such factors.    The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct ofcurrent capacity within two years through mergers andregrouping under legislation put before Parliament this monthand likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.    They said from September a semi-government body will assurerepayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurredthrough job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.    Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan appliedto the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnagebuilt to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.    The commission has held several hearings with the industryand approval should be given this month, the sources said.    A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with aplanned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state supportshould help Japanese yards recover their internationalcompetitiveness, they said.    Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable ofbuilding ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build amaximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT)in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.    This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced mostyards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.    The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.    The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between1986 and 1989.    Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December,followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd'sRegister of Shipping.    However, falling orders and declining internationalcompetitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses inthe industry, the sources said.    Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuildingcompanies reported current deficits in the first half of theyear to March 31 and five of them are expected to reportcurrent deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.    The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raiseproductivity to compete with South Korean yards which have alsobeen hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recntyears, the sources said.    In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting infierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. Thetwo largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T>and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T> --account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.    "World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride outthe recession as their technology is the best in the world,"said an official at a major Japanese shipping company.    The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's,has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships,and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said. REUTER
U.S. CARGO PREFERENCE FUNDING ACCORD SEEN NEAR The U.S. Departments of Agricultureand Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund theincreasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vesselsunder a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference.    Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a HouseAgriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the twodepartments are negotiating a "memorandum of understanding" oncargo preference.    Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of foodaid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to graduallyincrease over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased costof using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the TransportationDepartment instead of USDA. However, USDA officials saidTransportation has so far contributed no money.    The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expectedto resolve the matter, USDA officials said.    Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign AgriculturalService said yesterday the requirement that more food aidshipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult tomeet.    "As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up,its going to be harder and harder to meet," Kay said.    Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and GlennEnglish (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm exportprograms more costly and the program should be eliminated.    In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preferencehave been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests whoview cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet. Reuter

PANAMA CANAL OFFICIAL CONFIRMS NO 1988 TOLL RISE Panama Canal toll charges will not risein the year to end-September 1988, despite last October'slandslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into thewaterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said.    He told a press conference that in confirming theCommission's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988,he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989.    The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss inthe current financial year but this could be carried over andmet from next year's revenues.    This year's deficit resulted from the landslide which costthe canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This includedeight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest beingspent on earth-moving operations to prevent any furtherlandslides.    He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation andhe described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was anythreat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future.    Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillardcut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, addingthat he expected the canal board to determine whether and whenthe canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest.

U.S. SAYS NO SIGNAL BEING SENT BY SHIP MOVEMENTS A U.S. Navy battle group led by theU.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is in the northern Arabian Seaamid renewed concern about the safety of shipping off the coastof Iran, U.S. officials said today.    But Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffmann said that reports thenaval strike force was in the region did not mean the UnitedStates was sending a new warning to Iran against escalatingattacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf.    "Nothing like that has happened," he said. "No signal is beingsent."    He said that the Kitty Hawk is operating in an area whereit usually does. "It's normal. It's in the waters where it'ssupposed to be. It's been there for over a month."    The Kitty Hawk and its force of warplanes is the mainstayof the U.S. Indian Ocean Battle Group which patrols a vast areaextending from the Indian subcontinent through the Arabian Sea.    With the Kitty Hawk and its group in the Arabian Sea to thesouth and the U.S. Mideast Task Force in the Persian Gulf tothe north, the United States has 10 warships on either end ofthe strategic Straits of Hormuz.    The Pentagon, as is its custom, declined to confirm theexact whereabouts of the ships or what they were up to.

CHINESE PORT UNDERUSED DESPITE CONGESTION NEARBY The Chinese port of Ningbo isworking well below capacity despite being only 130 miles fromShanghai, which is seriously congested, a port official said.    Jiang Feng Xiang said the port -- the deepest in China --handled 17.95 mln tonnes of cargo last year, up from 10.44 mlnin 1985, but well below its potential capacity of 32 mlntonnes. Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986.    Jiang said Ningbo is under-utilised because of itsinadequate facilities, including a single track rail linelinking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network.    Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coalfrom north to south China and imports include fertiliser andsoda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks canhandle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour.    Most of Ningbo's port infrastructure has been built since1979, official publications show. A container berth and twotimber and three general cargo berths will be added during thecurrent 1986-90 five-year plan, Jiang said.

The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had beentold of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed athreat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.    U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-madeanti-ship "Silkworm" missiles, which pose a greater threat tomerchant ships than missiles used before.    The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intendedto attack ships were "misleading propaganda."    He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main causeof tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use "allits legitimate means to stem the cause of tension."    Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. "Weare fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shippinggoing and keep the freedom of navigation available in that veryvital waterway."    "We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of whatmight happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to andlistening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance inkeeping navigation free in that area," he said.    Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area werenot unusual.    A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier KittyHawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea.    The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as sayingthe U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in theregion. REUTER

BRAZILIAN LABOUR UNREST SPREADS, MANY BANKS SHUT Brazil's labour unrest is spreading,with many banks, universities and government statisticaloffices on strike and more pay disputes looming.    Bankworkers' leaders said that a national strike launchedyesterday to press for a 100 pct immediate pay rise and monthlysalary adjustments had the support of most of the 700,000workforce.    The strike today closed the stock exchanges of Sao Pauloand Rio de Janeiro.    For the government the one positive development on thelabour front was the gradual return to work of the nation's40,000 seamen, who began a national strike on February 27.    A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro told Reuters about halfthe seamen had returned to work after accords with 22 companiesand that the strike looked close to an end.    Otherwise the labour scene looked bleak, with the bankstrike posing the most serious problems for Brazil'scrisis-laden economy.    "If this goes on for more than a few days it will have aserious effect because normal financial operations will grindto a halt," said a western diplomat in Sao Paulo.    Today Brazil's 50,000 university teachers in the 42 federaluniversities launched a national strike, with a broad politicaldemand as well as a pay claim.    David Fleischer, head of the political science departmentin Brasilia university, told Reuters the National Associationof Higher Education Teachers wanted a full congressionalinquiry into what had happened to government education funds.    He said the universities were strapped for cash and thatthe association suspected the junior partner in the coalitiongovernment, the Liberal Front Party, PFL, of using educationfunds for projects which had helped their candidates inelections. The PFL holds the Education Ministry.    Hardly any sectors of the economy are proving immune to thecurrent labour unrest, caused by the return of high inflation,officially pegged at 33 pct for January-February.

But some unions, including those of building and miningworkers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and wouldcontinue their strikes for a few more days.    State officials said the government had agreed to reviseits proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightlyhigher cash benefits for injured workers.    Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes andother industrial action in the state on April 7, workers'compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details ofthe compromise package are not yet known.    The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council ofTrade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Walesunless the government modified its pending legislation on theissue.    State officials said the only sectors affected in the pastthree days were some government building projects, railwayfreight movement and cargo handling in Sydney's ports. REUTER

TOWNSEND FERRY INQUIRY TOLD BOW DOORS TO BLAME The Zeebrugge ferry disaster, in whicharound 200 people drowned seven weeks ago, was almost certainlycaused by the ship leaving port with its bow doors wide open, aBritish government inquiry was told.    Lawyer David Steel, representing the government, told theopening session of a public inquiry into the March 6 tragedythat this was "the only tenable explanation."    The ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, is owned byTownsend Thoresen, part of P and O's <PORL.L> subsidiaryEuropean Ferries Group.    Steel, commissioner of wrecks for England and Wales, saidthe inquiry would probably conclude that the ferry capsized incalm seas and fair weather a mile outside the Belgian port whenwater poured into the car deck.    "We think you will also conclude that the immediate cause ofthat was that the doors were open, he said.    Steel told the tribunal it appeared no attempt was made toclose either the inner or outer bow doors prior to what shouldhave been a routine voyage to the English port of Dover,despite a provision in the ship's "Stability Booklet" that thedoors were to be closed and kept closed.

KUWAIT REJECTS IRANIAN SPY BOAT CHARGES Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over theemirate's backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejectedcharges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spyboats.    "There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranianaccusation on the nature of the operations of the vesselsrecently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were outfishing," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.    It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri wassummoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with ForeignUndersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.    The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seizedseven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, whoconfessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.    It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullahwaterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at thehead of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.

U.S. TO PROTECT ONLY AMERICAN SHIPS U.S. military forces in the MideastGulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels andoccasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to"non-belligerent" states in the area, the Pentagon said today.    "No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protectingall shipping in those waters," Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims saidas the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase theprotective U.S. military presence in the gulf.    Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense SecretaryCaspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutralshipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq.    "As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels areunder our protection with the exception, on a limitedcase-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign MilitarySales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in theregion," Sims said.    U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaitiship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain andKuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances thatthe the arms would not be used elsewhere.    He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over toU.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by theU.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iraniancharges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war.    Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack.    Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up itsseven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additionalships and air cover are under consideration. Reuter
LAST-MINUTE OPPOSITION TO GULF BILL ARISES House Speaker Jim Wright predictedpassage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration toprovide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, buta last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals andconservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.    The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17thIraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision toprotect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags-- effectively making them American ships.    Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,and some charged the policy could lead the United States intothe 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.    The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by theDemocratic and Republican congressional leadership and theadministration -- which demanded a report within seven days onplans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.    The resolution was expected to pass without controversytoday in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the fullHouse was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberalDemocrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joinedin an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.    Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in thebill implied consent to Reagan's policies. Reuter

The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17thIraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --effectively making them American ships.    The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic andRepublican leadership as well as by the administration --required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide areport to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans toprotect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.    It did not, however, place any restrictions on theadministration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships andthus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.    The Senate was expected to approve the legislation thisweek. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.    Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only afirst step toward a greater congressional involvement informulating policy.
