PAKISTANI DECISION WILL HURT KENYAN TEA EXPORTS Pakistan's decision to suspend teaimport licences will hurt Kenyan tea exports in the short termwhile exporters seek new markets, sources close to Nairobibroking houses and exporters said.    Broking house officials in the Sri Lankan capital Colomboyesterday told Reuters Pakistan had suspended the licences inorder to link tea imports to Pakistani exports.    The latest available figures show that Kenyan exports toPakistan, mainly tea, were worth 75 mln dlrs in 1985, whileimports from Pakistan amounted to only 4.8 mln dlrs. Kenyaprovides over 50 pct of Pakistan's tea imports.    The Nairobi sources said the Pakistani decision did notcome as a surprise as Pakistan had been complaining of thetrade imbalance for some time.    "We are very disappointed that Pakistan took such action ...(it) will certainly hurt Kenya's tea industry in the short termas Pakistan is Kenya's second largest market," a source at onebroking house told Reuters.    One tea broker said Pakistan's move had already affectedKenya's tea trade and was largely responsible for an averagefall of two shillings a kilo at the export auction in Mombasalast Monday.    "The trend is likely to continue until other countriesreplace Pakistan, which usually buys all qualities of our tea,"he added.    Kenya has for a long time relied on Britain, Pakistan,Egypt and, to a lesser extent the United States, as majormarkets for its tea, the sources added.    Small-scale exporters who export mainly to Pakistan wouldbe worst hit by the Pakistani move as it would take them longerto find new outlets, they said. REUTER
ABNORMAL RADIATION FOUND IN SOVIET TEA/HAZELNUTS Abnormally high levels of radiation werefound in Soviet tea and hazelnuts more than nine months afterthe Chernobyl nuclear accident, West German residents in Moscowwere advised this week.    In a letter to the West German community here, AmbassadorJoerg Kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought inMoscow in February had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and-137 in tea from Azerbaijan and Ukrainian hazelnuts.    Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University,including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, werefound to be free of radiation, it said.    Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts containedcaesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by theUnited Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).    The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced noparticular health danger as most of the caesium remained in thetea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts.    The products sent for testing were bought in state shopsand private farmers' markets in Moscow, it added. Other Westernembassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratorytesting of Soviet food late last year because no abnormalradiation levels were detected.    "We didn't find anything so we stopped doing it," a U.S.Embassy spokesman said.    A British spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipmentremained in the embassy waiting room for British residents inMoscow who wanted to check their food, but laboratory tests hadnot been conducted for several months.    "Earlier we sent some food back to Britain as aprecautionary measure, but we stopped in the absence of anyalarming signals," he said. "If the tests had shown abnormalreadings, they would have been resumed." Reuter
