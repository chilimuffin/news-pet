EC BACKS NEW MOVE TO ENCOURAGE UNLEADED GASOLINE The EC Executive Commission has backeda plan to allow member countries to ban regular leaded gasolinein a move designed to encourage use of unleaded fuel.    It said in a statement it backed a proposal to allow ECstates to ban sales of regular grade gasoline containing leadat six months notice. The proposal, which needs approval by ECministers, would not force any member state to impose the ban."It's an option, not an obligation," a spokesman said.    But the Commission said imposing the ban would encouragethe use of unleaded fuel, as well as making it easier for gasstations by cutting the number of types of gasoline they had tostock. Reuter

EC AGREES TO REDUCE DIESEL EXHAUST EMISSIONS The European Community (EC) agreed onnew rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and busesin an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vaststretches of the region's forests.    Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreedmember states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next fewyears the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the mainsource of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.    The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, withtougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 andfor all new vehicles from October 1990.    The EC's executive Commission says the emission level ofnitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a yearfrom three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if allheavy vehicles met the new standards.    There are an estimated nine mln trucks and buses in use inthe EC, according to Commission figures.    The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to movetowards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonnrequested permission to do so to encourage the use oflow-pollution cars, diplomats said.

NEW GASOLINE GRADE TO RAISE U.S. REFINING COSTS A new grade of unleaded gasolinenow being test marketed will increase refining costs whenrefiners can least afford it, according to officials attendingthe National Petroleum Refiners Association conference here.    The new grade of unleaded gasoline has an octane level of89 compared with over 90 for super unleaded and 87 for regularunleaded gasoline.     Amoco Corp <AN> has test-marketed the new mid-gradegasoline and hopes to sell it on a regular basis in the South,East and Midwest by the beginning of June, according to PaulCollier, executive vice president of marketing.    Phillips Petroleum <P> expects to begin marketing the new89 octane unleaded gasoline in May, sources said.    Converting current refinery operations to produce the 89octane unleaded gsoline could cost hundreds of millions ofdollars per refinery but that depends on the present capacityand intensity of the refinery, said Amoco's Collier.    But not all oil company's welcome the introduction ofanother grade of unleaded gasoline.    "Three grades are not warranted," said Henry Rosenberg,chairman of Crown Central Petroleum <CNP>. "Refiners will haveto upgrade again," he added.    "An investment will have to be made," said Archie Dunham,executive vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, anoperating subsidiary of DuPont Corp <DD> in order to upgraderefinery operations.

ENERGY/U.S. REFINING U.S. refiners said they are worriedthat growing supplies of imports, proposed federalenvironmental regulations, and the marketing of a third gradeof unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time whenthe industry is recovering from a recent slump.     "We have to look at national security and cut the amountof products and crude coming into the country if it hurts theindustry," said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleumproducts at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD).    U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S.consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid1990s, according to the Department of Energy.    "Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oilrequirements 15 or so years from now?" asked John Swearingen,chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp <CIL> andformer chief executive of Amoco Corp <AN>. "If your answer tothat question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all thatwe can now to cope with this situation and improve ourposition."    But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, aview echoed by others attending this week's National PetroleumRefiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas.    "Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouragingbecause those things won't solve our problems and could wellcompound them," said Swearingen. "Once the government affectsvalues, once an import quota or license has value, it's goingto be subverted by government," he added.     William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs ofan import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as EnergySecretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits toencourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He alsosaid altnerative energy sources should be encouraged.     Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pctdeduction from the taxable income of oil companies is controversal but might work, said Dunham.    Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oilimports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude andproduct imports.    "Why would companies import crude when they could importproducts for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?"asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum<CNP>.     An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemicalproducts and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunhamsaid.     "The energy security issue should be considered whenenvironmental issues are considered," Martin said.    "The level of investment for the proposed lowering ofsulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, isunacceptable," Dunham said. "Most companies cannot afford it."    George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said theseproposals "will place pressure on small refining operations andpromote further industry consolidation."     An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released atthe conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pctweight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highwaydiesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs.     The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while theaverage aromatics content was 32 pct.     Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading offacilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline whichis beginning to be marketed by some companies.    "What will be the standard octane level in various gradesof unleaded gasoline?" asked Dunham. "A midlevel grade ofunleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means aninvestment has to be made," Dunham said.     This grade is not warranted, said Crown's Rosenberg.     Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins tomove higher in the next few months.     "We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,"said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketingcompany that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp <DIA>.     Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S.stocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasolinedemand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said.     "This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,"Hemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarilya gasoline producer. Reuter
EPA TO SHIELD WATER SUPPLY FROM GASOLINE LEAKS The Environmental Protection Agencyproposed rules to shield water supplies from potential leaksfrom 1.4 mln underground storage tanks, nearly half of whichare used to store gasoline at service stations.    It said the rules would require owners and operators of thetanks containing petroleum products or certain hazardouschemicals to monitor the tanks for leaks and, in case of leaks,to notify appropriate authorities.    The owners and operators of petroleum tanks would also befinancially responsible for any contamination, the EPA said.    It said financial requirements for chemical tanks will beproposed later.    Hazardous tanks are regulated separately.    EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said "Thousands of undergroundstorage tanks are currently leaking and, without adequatecontrols, many more can be expected to leak in the future,endangering our nation's drinking-water supplies."    He added in a statement "We intend to ensure that eachunderground tank is either upgraded or closed down and thatsafe operating and cleanup procedures are following to providemaximum protection from any future leaks." reuter

U.S. GASOLINE SURPLUS SEEN OVER NEAR TERM Unless U.S. refiners reduce the amountof gasoline they now produce, the oil industry will enter thecoming summer driving season with the largest surplus of motorfuel since 1984, oil analysts and traders said.    "They key question is how much gasoline refiners produce inthe coming weeks," said Larry Goldstein of Petroleum IndustryResearch Inc. "If refiners cut output and demand turns upward,gasoline stocks could begin to draw, and the surplus couldpotentially turn around in four to eight weeks," saidGoldstein.    The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. gasoline stocksfor the week ended April 17 are 37.6 mln barrels above lastyear's levels, and analysts said they don't believe theexpected one to two pct rise in demand will take care of thesurplus before the start of the summer driving season, whichbegins Memorial Day weekend.    The API said the last time stocks were this high was in1984, when there was a 27 mln barrel excess. Oil traders saidthat the surplus held throughout the summer of 1984, depressingprices for the motor fuel.    Over the past several weeks, analysts said they expectedrefiners to reduce production because there was no profit incontinued production of gasoline due to the surplus. However,refineries continued to operate at higher levels, they said.    U.S. refineries have been running at about 78.8 pct ofcapacity during March and April this year, compared to 77.5 atthis time last year, API statistics show.    Because of the current excess in stocks, one planner for amajor oil company said he believed that most companies arecontemplating cutting refinery throughput over the near term.    He said some refiners appear to be selling lessaggressively in order to have product on hand to meet theexpected rise in demand this summer.    Goldstein said that other factors, such as higher speedlimits, the gasoline lead phasedown, and possible newrestrictions on gasoline vapor pressure could tighten thesupply situation this summer.    However, a planner at another major oil company said thatalthough large inventories are dampening the price outlook forgasoline this season, he does not expect refiners to cut outputsoon.    That oil company planner said high crude oil runs reducethe refiner's average costs, making the incremental barrel ofgasoline cheaper to produce.    Most analysts expect a slight upturn this summer over thesummer of 1986. Bo Poates, an analyst at the Energy FuturesGroup Inc said he foresees demand up about one pct in thesecond and third quarters of 1987.    Chase Econometrics' Scott Jones sees gasoline demand rising1.9 to 2.2 pct for the year, due mainly to continued lowprices. Reuter

JAPAN FIRMS TO LAUNCH SALES OF 100 OCTANE GASOLINE Japanese oil companies are startingcampaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growingdomestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sourcessaid.    Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline thissummer, starting with <Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20.    Showa Shell Sekiyu KK <SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.    Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite ahigher price than regular octane gasoline, which has promptedother oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.    "We have received a good response from consumers of FormulaShell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuelconsumption," Showa Shell said.    Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higherthan regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct shareof Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said.    High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's totalgasoline sales in Japan, it added.    Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pctof its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediatelyafter the launch of its Idemitsu 100.    Nippon Oil Co Ltd <NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in highoctane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasolinesales.    The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market sharehas been spurred by expectations that the government will liftgasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline stationconstruction in the next two to three years.    "Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasolinesales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasolineproduction quotas," an official at a major oil company said.    An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Tradeand Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the governmentpress ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, includingthe lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oilcompanies increase their international competitiveness.    Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil,Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under theproduction quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.    Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pctfrom the previous year, according to a MITI report. REUTER
