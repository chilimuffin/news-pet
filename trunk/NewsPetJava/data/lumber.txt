Commerce officials would not say if they found any Canadiancompanies had been evading the charge, but that following thetalks they were convinced all exporters were complying with theagreement.    Undersecretary of Commerce Bruce Smart said "We aregratified to learn that companies in Canada have begun payingthe export charge on lumber."

TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS The death of the world's tropical rainforests could trigger a new debt crisis and social andbiological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved withthe International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said.    At stake is the ability of developing nations, includingBrazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts andthe loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars inimportant sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, theysaid.    The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting ofconsumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problemis already acute.    The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economicdangers. "For many third world nations, the loss of the forestis not just a loss of resources," said Delfin Ganapin, aPhilippine government consultant on environmental impact.    "In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest,now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitablelogging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of loggingforeign exchange earnings is serious," he said.    About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas thatare now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops.    Government security advisers say that as a direct result,the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is inthe upland areas, said Ganapin.    Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoodshave less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no knownway to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within.    "No replanting programme has been successful," said AlmyHafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation.    Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the nexttwo years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denudedland in the Philippines.    The experts say that without a major initiative from thedevelopment banks, the vicious circle will continue withcountries cutting more forest to help service short-term debtsat the cost of long-term insolvency.    Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is notnecessarily the most direct economic product of the forests,and nations must be educated in how best to "farm" them, saidPeter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director.    There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the endproducts of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs ayear, he said.    U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredientsto higher plants growing in the forests.    Deforestation would wipe out the chance of furtherdiscoveries and force major corporations to research, developand produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientistssay is incalculable.    By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still beexporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earningswill drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than twobillion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said.    Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank,Inter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84,only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said.    WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forestshave vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining,up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive loggingpractises and by local farmers. REUTER

USDA'S AMSTUTZ "SYMPATHETIC" TO WOOD CREDITS U.S. Agriculture UndersecretaryDaniel Amstutz said he was "totally sympathetic" with U.S. woodproducers' desire to have their exports eligible for governmentcredit guarantees.    But he told the Senate Appropriations Agriculturesubcommittee that including wood products in the department'sshort- or intermediate-term export guarantee programs wouldconflict with U.S. multilateral trade obligations.    Currently, U.S. wood products are not eligible forgovernment export credit guarantee because they are considered"manufactured products," Amstutz said.    He said USDA had devoted an "enormous amount" of time toconsidering making wood products eligible for the guaranteesand that Congress was considering a measure to do so. Reuter
WALL STREET STOCKS/PAPER AND LUMBER PRODUCERS Stocks of paper and lumber producerstumbled as a rumor spread that the Japanese may impose tariffson wood and paper products, analysts and industry officialssaid. But, they said, logic and their own research do notsupport the rumors.    "Apparently a rumor is floating around trading circlesabout the Japanese doing something about tariffs on wood andpaper products," Lowell Moholt, director of investor relationsat Weyerhaeuser Co said. "And we can only assume that thisrumor is one of the factors hurting the stocks."    "I have talked to many people, some with governmentcontacts, and most of them have been mystified by the rumor,"said Moholt.    Nevertheless, International Paper <IP> fell 4-3/8 to95-1/2, Weyerhaeuser Co <WY> two to 51-1/2, Potlatch Corp <PCH>3-1/2 to 69, Great Northern Nekoosa <GNN> 3-1/8 to 85-1/2,Temple Inland Inc <TIN> 2-3/4 to 57-1/4, Boise Cascade 2-3/8 to74-3/8, Georgia Pacific Corp <GP> 1-1/2 to 43-3/4, ChampionInternational Corp <CHA> 1-3/8 to 36-1/2 and Pope and TalbotInc <POP> 1/2 to 36.    "My sources told me there is no grain of truth to theJapanese imposing tariffs," Sherman Chao, analyst with SalomonInc said. "The realities and the logic do not support theserumors," he said.    "The Japanese have a lot more to lose by imposing tariffs.They are running a trade surplus," he said, "and if theystarted a trade war it would hurt them more than the U.S."    Chao said that U.S. producers annually export about twobillion dlrs of forest products to Japan. "Three quarters ofthat is in the form of wood products, meaning logs, wood chipsand lumber, and the balance is paper products."    "They (the Japanese) don't have any domestic sources tomake up for the restrictions," Chao said, "so it's not likethey would put a tariff to protect their own industry."    "The rumors do no make economic sense, and I am skeptical,"analyst Mark Rogers of Prudential Bache Securities said, "butpolitics has been known to override economic concerns."     Speculation has surfaced on Wall Street recently that theJapanese would take action to retaliate against tariffs theReagan Administration imposed last Friday on Japaneseelectronics products.    Rogers said the rumor fueled the profit taking that wasalready occuring in these stocks. "In a nervous market, peopletend to take profits, and they tend to take profits that havebeen the biggest gainers lately." Reuter
CANADA LUMBER EXPORTS MAY BECOME UNPROFITABLE Canada's softwood lumber will becomeunprofitable for some forest product producers if pricesdecline to about 175 U.S. dlrs per thousand board feet of twoby four inch lumber from current levels of about 195 U.S. dlrs,Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman toldreporters.    Zimmerman reiterated profitability has been hurt by a moveby Canadian negotiators to impose last January a 15 pct exporttax on softwood lumber shipped to the U.S. in exchange for aU.S. lumbermen's lobby dropping its request for a countervailduty.    "I think that there has been a falling off in the market, soI think there is a moderate slow down in the price now,"Zimmerman said at a media briefing.    Zimmerman said the adverse impact from lower U.S. lumberproduct prices would be felt by lumber mills in eastern Canadafirst, migrating westward.    "The country has swallowed a time bomb and it will go offwhen times get tough," Zimmerman said.    He also said the federal government should maintain theexisting 15 pct export tax and not allow provinces to offsetthe tax with increased provincial fees for cutting lumber. Reuter

CANADIAN PACIFIC (CP) UNIT STUDIES PULP MILL CIP Inc, wholly-owned by CanadianPacific Ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in Texas whichwould use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president CecilSlenniken said in an interview.     The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and wasartificially developed several years ago. The plant, which hasbeen grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet inthree months and is said to produce better quality newsprintthan wood pulp, a CIP official said.     Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre butwould need partners to begin the project.    "We are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions ofdollars it would take for such a project," Slenniken said.     He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis tomake newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pctsoftwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant.    CIP, Canada's second largest newsprint producer, recentlylaunched a 366 mln Canadian dlr newsprint mill at Gold River,British Columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metrictonnes per year by fall of 1989.
