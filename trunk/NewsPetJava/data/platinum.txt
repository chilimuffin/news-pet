S. AFRICAN UNION OBJECTS TO PLANNED MATTHEY MOVE A South African trade union is indispute with a subsidiary of Britain's Johnson Matthey Plc overthe company's proposal to move a platinum refinery nearJohannesburg to a black tribal homeland.    The 30,000-member mainly black Chemical Workers IndustrialUnion said it fears the planned move to the Bophuthatswanahomeland, where South African unions are not recognised, couldlead to job losses and affect wages.    A mass dismissal last year at the Impala Platinum HoldingsLtd <IPLA.J> mines in the tribal homeland sent world platinumprices rocketing.    The union said talks with management over the proposed movehad broken down. It said an earlier ballot of refinery workersshowed that most favoured striking over the move but added thatno final decision had been taken on strike action.    The refinery processes all platinum metals of RustenburgPlatinum Holdings Ltd, the world's largest platinum producer.    It is owned by Matthey Rustenburg Ltd, a joint-subsidiaryof Johnson Matthey and Rustenburg which, in turn, is owned bymining group Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co Ltd. Reuter
PLATINUM DEMAND ESTIMATED 17 PCT HIGHER BY 1991 Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mlnounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mlnin 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for JohnsonMatthey Plc said.    Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisationin Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase inconsumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largestsingle application for platinum.    Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was releasedin London today.    Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest furtherincrease in investment buying and may well be cautious.    He said South Africa was the most likely source ofadditional supplies and will need to increase output by about500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.    The capital investment required to produce the additionaloutput would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the politicalclimate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.    The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,Clark said.    "The very probability of a growth in demand set against themassive investment required for expansion - and that expansiononly being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me toconclude that the price of platinum will be substantiallyunderpinned in the medium to long-term," Clark said.
