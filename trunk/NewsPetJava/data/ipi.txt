CHINESE INDUSTRIAL GROWTH RATE UP AFTER WEAK 1986 The value of China's industrial output inJanuary and February this year was 14.1 pct higher than in thesame 1986 period, the New China News Agency said.    Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January1986 and 0.9 pct from February 1985 to 1986.    The agency said the most recent increase was largely due tolast year's poor performance. "No significant improvement wasmade in economic results," it said, adding that some successeswere reported in readjusting the industrial product mix in thelast quarter of 1986.    The agency said the amount of tied up working capital roseand sizeable funds were occupied by unsaleable goods in 1986.    It quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987industrial production to increase at a proper rate and withbetter results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underwaythroughout the country. It gave no more details.    The official industrial growth target this year is sevenpct, down from an actual 9.2 pct last year. REUTER
U.S. FEB INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ROSE 0.5 PCT AFTER REVISED 0.1 PCT  U.S. industrial production rose 0.5pct in February after a revised 0.1 pct increase in January,the Federal Reserve Board said.    The Fed previously said industrial production rose 0.4 pctin January.    The Fed said the February gain was dominated by a sharprise in motor vehicle production, which boosted output of bothconsumer goods and business equipment. Industrial productionstood at 127.3 pct of the 1977 average in February and was up1.7 pct from a year ago, the Fed said.    The Fed also revised the December industrial productionfigure to a gain of 0.5 pct from 0.3 pct originally reported.    Manufacturing output rose 0.5 pct in February after a 0.1pct increase in January and included gains of 0.8 pct indurables and 0.1 pct in non-durables, the Fed said.    Manufacturing was 2.4 pct above the year ago level.    Production of auto assemblies rose to an annual rate of 8.3mln units last month from a January rate of 7.5 mln units.    Output of consumer goods rose 0.6 pct after falling 0.3 pctin January and output of consumer durables was up 2.1 pct inFebruary after falling by 2.0 pct in January.    Business equipment production rose 1.0 pct in February,reflecting more output of autos and trucks for business use anda recovery from strikes in farm equipment industries, the Fedsaid.    Mining output rose 0.1 pct after a 1.6 pct increase inJanuary, but was still six pct lower than a year ago.    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after a 1.2 pctrise in January.    Output of defense and space equipment was up 0.4 pct, thesame as in January, and 6.2 pct higher than a year ago.    Output of construction supplies rose 0.2 pct in Februaryafter a 1.5 pct January rise.    Materials output increased by 0.2 pct last month, thefourth consecutive monthly increase after declining throughoutmuch of 1986. The recent strength in materials has beenconcentrated in textiles, paper and chemicals, the Fed said.    Output of home goods was up 0.3 pct in February and the Fedsaid production of items like appliances and furniturecontinued strong last month. Reuter

SOVIET FIGURES SHOW ECONOMY STILL SHORT OF TARGETS The Soviet economy recovered slightlylast month after a poor performance in January, but majorindustries, including oil and machinery, are still short ofproduction targets, official figures show.    Central Statistical Board data published in the weeklyEkonomicheskaya Gazeta yesterday showed that industrial outputwas only up 0.8 pct in the first two months of 1987 over thesame period of last year.    However, the figure for January alone showed a fall inoutput of 0.1 pct from a year earlier. Production is targettedto increase 4.4 pct for all of 1987.    The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises mettheir supply obligations in January and February.    Production of oil, the country's main export to Westernnations, hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February, up from97.3 mln a year earlier, and exceeded its target by 0.5 pct.    Economists said this reflected the huge investments pouredinto the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reversethe stagnation in production which began in November 1983.    Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a declinein Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 141.6billion in 1985.    Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targetswere also not fulfilled, but did not give figures.    Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionallybad weather at the start of the year and stricter qualitycontrols imposed on enterprises.    Production in the machine-building sector, a priority inMoscow's plans for economic renewal, recovered slightly inFebruary but was still 3.6 pct lower in the first two months ofthe year compared with the same period of 1986.    The figures showed that five republics produced less thanin the first two months of 1986. REUTER

U.K. JAN INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES 0.4 PCT, MANUFACTURING DOWN 2.3 PCT -  Britain's Public Sector BorrowingRequirement (PSBR) showed a provisional net repayment of 300mln stg in February, compared with an unrevised 3.7billion stg repayment in January, the Treasury said.    This gives a cumulative PSBR in the first 11 months of thecurrent fiscal year of 100 mln stg, compared with a 2.7 billionrequirement in the like period last year.    The government's forecast for the PSBR in fiscal 1986/87 is7.1 billion stg, but markets expect a significant undershoot onthis number. The February data was within market forecasts.    The Central Government Borrowing Requirement on its ownaccount in February was a net repayment of 100 mln stg after aunrevised net repayment of 3.4 billion stg in January. In thefirst 11 months, the central government borrowing on its ownaccount was 2.3 billion stg, after 2.1 billion in January.    Local Authorities made a repayment estimated at 100 mln stgin February. The cumulative local authorities' repayment forthe first 11 months was 700 mln. The Treasury said the fallabout 2.5 billion stg in the cumulative PSBR at this point thisyear over last was largely due to lower public corporation andlocal authority borrowing. This was also the case last month,it said.    The Public Corporations' Borrowing Requirement is estimatedat minus 400 mln stg, to give a cumulative repayment of 1.4billion stg.    The local authority and public sector surplus on the 11months cumulative basis was 2.1 billion, compared with a flatposition at the same stage last year.    The Treasury said that the proceeds from privatisation of<British Airways Plc> reduced requirements by 400 mln stg.    The Treasury said the General Government BorrowingRequirement is estimated to be a net repayment of 100 mln stgin February, giving a cumulative requirement of 1.1 billion.    Consolidated fund revenue was 8.8 billion stg in February,giving a cumulative total of 101.4 billion in the first 11months, 4.5 pct up from the like stage last year.    Inland Revenue Receipts for the first 11 months were 1.8billion stg, or 3.5 pct higher than a year earlier. Receiptsfrom Customs and Excise were 3.5 billion stg in the first 11months, 10.5 pct higher than in the previous year.    The Treasury said that budget forestalling, when tradersbring in goods in advance of today's annual budget, brought in300 mln stg more in customs and excise receipts than inFebruary 1986.    Consolidated fund expenditure was 8.4 billion stg inFebruary, with a cumulative 102.5 billion for the first 11months, four pct higher than in the previous year.    Supply expenditure was provisionally estimated at 8.3billion stg in February, giving a cumulative total of 91.2billion or three pct above last year's equivalent total. REUTER

SOVIET ECONOMIST SAYS PRODUCTION FIGURES PADDED A leading Soviet economist said thepractice of padding figures was significantly inflating thecountry's industrial production data.    "According to the information of state monitoring organs,the padding of figures makes up one-and-a-half to three percent of the volume of production," Alexei Sergeyev told theofficial newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya.    "In my opinion, it is significantly higher," Sergeyev, whoworks at the Economics Institute of the Soviet Union's Academyof Sciences, said.    Most Western economists have for years allowed for acertain padding of figures when analysing Soviet statistics forindustrial production.    Sergeyev said about 600 mln roubles was lost annually inraw material industries by paying wages and bonuses for workwhich was not in fact performed.    He said the elimination of figure-padding and othermalpractices would save billions of roubles and would pay forthe Soviet Union's social development program up to the year2000. REUTER

TAIWAN INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT FALLS, CURRENCY BLAMED Taiwan's industrial production index,fell, largely as the result of the rising Taiwan dollar, by8.18 pct to 140.06 (base 1981) in February from a revised152.53 in January, the Economy Ministry said.    It was the second consecutive monthly fall, after droppingnine pct in January, but it was still 26.49 pct up on February1986 following a very extended rise last year.    The January figure was revised from a preliminary 154.82.    A ministry official attributed the decline to fallingproduction of non-metal products, textiles and transportationequipment, and less mining and house construction.    The official said the decline was also caused by fallingexports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar,which has made Taiwanese products more expensive.    He expected the decline to continue in the next few monthsbecause of further appreciation of the local dollar against theU.S. Currency.    The Taiwan dollar advanced more than 15 pct against theU.S. Dollar since September 1985. It closed at 34.40 to theU.S. Dollar today, and is expected to rise to about 32 to thedollar by the end of this year, foreign bankers and economistssaid. REUTER

This was the highest positive balance since the questionwas first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.    In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pctrespectively.    Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Ofall polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books tobe above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.    In February, 25 pct thought their export books were belownormal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct,the proportion of companies rating their export books abovenormal was unchanged between February and March.

REPORT SAYS SOVIET ECONOMIC PLANS TOO OPTIMISTIC The Soviet economy has grown at anincreased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, but hisgoals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S.intelligence agencies.    The report was prepared jointly by the Central IntelligenceAgency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for theCongressional Joint Economic committee, which released it.    It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986,Gorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate ofgrowth over the previous 10 years.    Gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, removeincompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism andmodernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for someof the gains, the report said.    "Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev hasadopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to hisefforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-termsolutions are attributes that his immediate predecessorslacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's program appears too ambitiouson a number of counts," the report said.    Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Unionsaid Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four yearsif he continues his reform policies.    "I don't think he can last four years," Marshall Goldman ofHarvard University told a Congressional hearing. "He's moving sofast, he's stepping on so many toes."    A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of theSmithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute for Advanced Russianstudies.    The economic report said meeting targets for commodityoutput would require unrealistic gains in productivity andindustrial output targets appear too high to allow time toinstall more advanced equipment.    None of Gorbachev's proposals would change the system ofeconomic incentives that has discouraged innovation andtechnological change, the report added.    "The first significant resistance to specific policies,although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both themassive government and party bureaucracy, particularly amongenterprise managers who complained that they were being askedto carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise qualitystandards and output targets simultaneously," the report said.    The CIA-DIA report predicted two to three pct growth in theSoviet economy over the next several years. It said the SovietUnion trailed the U.S. by seven to 12 years in advancedmanufacturing technologies, such as computers andmicroprocessors. Reuter

 German February industrial output rises 3.2 pct (January fall 3.4 pct) -  An international protocol to severelylimit the use of industrial chemicals which are believed todamage the earth's protective ozone layer could be signed thisyear, officials and scientists here said.    "By the end of this year, we should have an internationalprotocol in place we can all be proud of," U.S. Environmentalprotection agency officer Bill Long told reporters.    The chemicals are chiefly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) whichare used in refrigeration and making foam plastics, solventsand aerosols. The earth's upper ozone layer absorbs most of theharmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.    The officials and scientists were meeting in Tokyo, aheadof an international conference on the problem later this monthin either Vienna, or Geneva, Long said.    Robert Watson, a program manager for atmospheric problemsat the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration saida protocol should demand an initial freeze on the use of CFCsby industry. This should be followed by a gradual reduction inCFC volume until no CFC gases are released into the air, hesaid. The U.S. Has already banned use of use CFCs in aerosolsand Japan has asked for voluntary restraint, but both still useCFCs in industrial processes. REUTER

The ministry had originally estimated that industrialproduction fell 3.0 pct in January.    The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by justunder one percentage point next month when the March figure isreleased, a ministry statement said.    The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at aprovisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the Januaryand December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.    In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.    The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pctincrease in construction output compared with January, whenproduction in many industrial sectors was depressed byunusually severe winter weather.    Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise inproduction in February compared with January. But energy sectoroutput fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.    The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to bea better guide to trends, said output in January and Februarytogether fell around two pct against November and December.    The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct inJanuary/February against November/December due to the coldJanuary weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct andmining output 10 pct.    Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct inJanuary/February compared with November/December.    Within this sector, the output of both basic products andof food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production ofcapital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods wasunchanged.    Compared with the same months of 1986, industrialproduction in January and February 1987 fell 1-1/2 pct, theministry said.    Manufacturing industry output fell one pct, with output ofbasic products down three pct, capital goods down one pct andfood, tobacco and alcohol production 1-1/2 pct lower. Makers ofconsumer goods posted a 1-1/2 pct year-on-year rise in thetwo-month period.    In other industrial sectors, mining production fell fourpct and construction output 4-1/2 pct.

INSTITUTE SEES W.GERMAN OUTPUT FALL IN 1987 Production in the manufactured goodsindustry has been falling since mid-1986 and will decline bybetween one and two pct this year after a 2.5 pct increase in1986, the Ifo economic institute said.    An Ifo report said recessionary influences were affectingthe engineering industry particularly. It saw a decline of twoto three pct in this sector after a 5.2 pct rise in 1986.    Orders, especially from abroad, were also falling sharplyfor capital goods in the electronics sector, it added.    Ifo also predicted stagnation in the automobile industry in1987 after a particularly successful 1986 when production rose5.1 pct.    Chemical industry production, which fell by 0.9 pct lastyear, was likely to stagnate or decline by one pct in 1987.This sector suffered from slack demand from abroad and from lowdomestic consumption.

EC INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION GROWTH HALTS IN JANUARY Industrial production in the EuropeanCommunity (EC) in January showed no growth compared withJanuary 1986, the EC statistics office, Eurostat, said in areport.    It said the EC industrial production index, base 1980,stood at 103.9 in both months.    EC officials said while the lack of growth may have beendue in part to the icy weather which gripped large parts of theEC in January, it also reflects a worrying trend.    Eurostat said for the last three months for which figuresare known, industrial output rose by only 0.9 pct compared withthe year-earlier period.    Annual growth in the 12 months to January averaged about1.8 pct, well below the 2.8 pct figure recorded in the 12months ending last June, the office said. REUTER

BANK OF FRANCE SEES PICKUP IN INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY The Bank of France said in its latestmonthly report on the French economy it expected a pickup inindustrial production registered in March to gather steam overthe next few months.    Without giving figures, the report said last month's rise,partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lostearlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly toa firming of domestic demand.    "New progress is expected in all main sectors except capitalgoods where production will remain at its present level," thereport added.    The upbeat report comes in the wake of grim March tradebalance figures which showed a deficit in industrial trade forthe first time since June 1982.    While the automobile industry remained unchanged frompreviously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew andwas expected to accelerate except in the area of domesticappliances. Semi-finished goods showed a clear increase in allsectors. Construction and civil engineering, boosted by a risein public works, also improved, while retail trade sales in allsectors continued to slow. REUTER

SOVIET UNION SETS 4.5 PCT INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT GROWTH Soviet Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin toldthe Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned torise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987.    In the first nine months of this year, industrial outputrose by 3.6 pct.    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalentto gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pctagainst a planned 4.1 pct this year.    He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year.    The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected theharvest this year.    Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineeringindustry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has describedas a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if theSoviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets.    "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in themachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires," saidTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan.    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makesmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of thisyear against the same period of 1986. This is well below the7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recentmeeting that an improvement in economic performance depended toa large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scalemeasures are planned to save resources," he said.    Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Sovietdefence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, thesame as announced last year.    Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increasespending next year on medical services, education, pensions andsocial insurance schemes    He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171billion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than hadoriginally been envisaged in the 1986-1990 Five-Year Plan.

SOVIET INDUSTRIAL GROWTH/TRADE SLOWER IN 1987 The Soviet Union's industrial output isgrowing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign tradehas fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.    Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda showindustrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.    Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2pct.    Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billionroubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.    One factor affecting industrial growth was the introductionof a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Lastyear's calculations of industrial output included all goods,irrespective of quality.    Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, specialinspectors have the right to reject goods they consider belowstandard.    Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods wererejected in the nine-month period.    The figures also showed that on October 1, there were morethan 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.    The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of theeconomy has been an important part of the modernisationcampaign, with measures introduced recently to allow thesetting up of small shops on a private basis.    Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine monthsagainst 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.    But western economists said they treat Soviet productivityfigures with caution, as they are more broadly based than inthe West, which measures worker output over a given period.    Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Unionas of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same periodlast year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against194 roubles a year ago. REUTER
