SOUTH AMERICAN FISH MEAL PRODUCTION AT RECORD HIGH Production of fish meal by the threeSouth American producers -- Chile, Peru and Equador -- lastyear reached 2.5 mln tonnes, equalling the record output of1970, the International Association of Fish Meal Manufacturers(IAFMM) said.    However, IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chileanand Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987to be much lower than the 651,000 tonnes produced in the lastquarter of 1986, due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile forthe month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peruin the same month.    The statement added that, due to technical market promotionand energetic sales by Chile and Peru, the stock position atthe end of the year remained reasonable.    Fish meal production outside South America decreasedslightly, falling from 114,400 to 111,100 tonnes.    The IAFMM said fish meal consumption in 1986 rose in WestGermany, Scandinavian countries, Eastern Europe and the FarEast, but fell in the U.S. And remained static in the U.K.    It added that fish meal consumption had suffered fromcompetition with feed grade tallow in the U.S. And with skimmedmilk powder in the U.K.    IAFMM figures for fish oil production in the main producingnations, in thousands of tonnes, were -                    Oct/Dec            Jan/Dec                 1986    1985       1986     1985 CHILE             22       8        109       76 PERU              56      28        238      104 NORWAY            14      14         97      130 ICELAND           44      52        102      118 DENMARK           20      18         88       77 U.S.              10       8        152      129 JAPAN             67      91        213      249 REUTER

DUTCH FEED COMPOUNDER STARTS CASE AGAINST EC LEVY A major animal feed producer, CehaveNV Veghel (CHV), has begun legal proceedings against theapplication of the European Community grain co-responsibilitylevy, with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feedtrade association, Het Comite, association chief executivePeter Pex told Reuters.    Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and thecourt said it would give its verdict within six weeks. "However,that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court torefer questions on the interpretation and application of thelevy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg," Pex added.    Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not takeaccount of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean acompounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy inits own national currency than it received down the chain fromthe original producer of the grain.    "We would like the Business Administration Court in theHague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whetherthe Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but alsowhether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,"Pex said.    "It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,but we have had no political help, and therefore have no optioneven though it could take years," Pex added.    Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against thegrain levy because the bill the company received from thecommodity board included grain from a wide variety of originsand was therefore considered to be the best general basis for alegal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.    Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions onthe levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a casebrought by the Association of European Animal FeedManufacturers, FEFAC. REUTER
