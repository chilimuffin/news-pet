Forecasts for lemons will be issued in October, November,January, April and July and for grapefruit in October, January,April, and July and for tangerines in October,  January andApril. There will be no change in the estimating program forCalifornia oranges.    Arizona forecasts will be dropped for lemons, oranges,grapefruit and tangerines in November, December February,March, May and June, with forecasts retained in October,January, April and July, it said.

FCOJ SUPPLIES SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE YEAR AGO-USDA Total supply of frozen concentratedorange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantlyabove year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well belowthe previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Departmentsaid Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shownsharp gains to date.    The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably beaffected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, onwhether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S.have caused injury.    Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruitcoupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that growerprices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier.    The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storageat the beginning of February were moderately larger than a yearearlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm.    In view of the strong demand and seasonally reducedsupplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm.    During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processednoncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.    Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remainingsuppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as aconsequence prices have strengthened, the department said. Reuter

U.S. TO SET ORANGE JUICE DUTIES MONDAY The Commerce Department on Mondaywill set final dumping duties on frozen orange juice fromBrazil, department officials said.    A preliminary duty of 8.54 pct was set last Oct 17 on theimports, which run at about 700 mln dlrs a year. Commerce'sruling on Monday will reset the duties on the basis of moredetailed cost information, industry officials said.    The duties now are being assessed on a temporary basis,pending a final ruling by the U.S. International TradeCommission (ITC) on whether the imports are injuring thedomestic orange industry.    The ITC ruled provisionally last June 18 that the domesticindustry was being injured by Brazilian orange juice imports.    A complaint that the Brazilian imports were being dumped atbelow costs on the U.S. market was filed on behalf of U.S.growers by the Florida Citrus Mutual, a Lakeland, Fla., group,Alcoma Packing Co, Inc, and Barry Citrus Products.    U.S. officials say about half of the orange juice consumedin the United States comes from Brazil. reuter

TRADERS SAY USDA MAY LOWER ORANGE CROP ESTIMATE The U.S. Department of Agriculture willprobably decrease its estimate of the 1986/87 Florida orangecrop today to as low as 123 mln boxes from 129 mln boxes,analysts and industry sources said.    The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at1500 hrs EST (2100 gmt) today.    Analysts said the market is anticipating a downwardrevision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted.    The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged sinceOctober, should be affected this time by recent evidence of ashortfall in the early and midseason crop now that thoseharvests are complete. Analysts said based on earlier USDAprojections, the harvests should have been five to seven mlnboxes larger than they were.    "They are going to cut their estimate," said Bob Tate, anFCOJ broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in Miami. "The onlyquestion is whether they will admit the whole thing in thisestimate."    Tate said it is possible the USDA will lower its estimateby a lesser amount, perhaps three mln boxes, and continue todrop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop pictureclarifies. The late season harvest, consisting mostly ofValencia oranges, has not yet started, he noted.    "They'll temper it," said Judy Weissman, FCOJ analyst withShearson Lehman Bros. "The main drop will probably come inJuly."    She expects today's estimate will be 126 mln boxes. Reuter
USDA ORANGE JUICE YIELD ESTIMATE The U.S. Agriculture Departmentprojected an average yield of 1.47 gallons of frozenconcentrated orange juice per box (42.0 degree brix equivalent)from Florida's 1986/87 crop.

BRAZILIAN FCOJ OFFICIAL WELCOMES U.S. DUTY CUT Mario Branco Peres, president ofthe Brazilian Association of Citrus Juice Industries(Abrassuco), welcomed a decision by the U.S. CommerceDepartment sharply cutting its duties on imported frozenconcentrated orange juice (FCOJ) from Brazil.    Speaking by telephone from Sao Paulo, Peres said, "With itsdecision, the U.S. government recognised the honesty ofBrazilian exporters, who never have the intention of practisingdumping."    In a final ruling yesterday, the U.S. government eliminatedthe duties shipped by Sucocitrico Cutrale and cut to 1.96 pctthe duty on Citrosuco. Duties of 8.54 pct had been set lastOctober.    Peres said Brazil had enough orange juice to meet the needsof its major clients.    "We do not have in stock what we would like to have, but wecertainly have enough orange juice available to supply ourbuyers," Peres said, declining to estimate the amount of thecurrent stock. "To keep it a secret is part of our strategy," headded.    Peres said the price policy of the orange juice was basedon market conditions.    "There is nothing better than a free trade policy," he said.    Cutrale and Citrosuco officials were not immediatelyavailable for comment. Reuter

USDA FLORIDA ORANGE REPORT CONSIDERED BEARISH The U.S. Agriculture Department'slatest estimates on 1986/87 Florida orange production andorange juice yield are bearish for the frozen concentratedorange juice futures market because the yield increase wasgreater than expected, FCOJ traders and analysts said.    The USDA projected an average yield of 1.50 gallons of FCOJper box versus last month's estimate of 1.47 gallons.    The government estimated Florida orange production(excluding Temples) at 122.9 mln boxes versus 124 mln lastmonth. Temples were unchanged at 3.4 mln boxes.

U.S. AGENCY RULES AGAINST BRAZIL ORANGE JUICE The U.S. International TradeCommission, ITC, voted to authorize the Commerce Department toimpose anti-dumping duties on imports of Brazilian frozenconcentrated orange juice.    The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition inits final ruling on the matter.    Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the CommerceDepartment's final ruling of March 9, and activates ananti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozenconcentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigatorsaid.    The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports haveinjured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had alreadyruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decisionlast fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said.    The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted onimports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice sinceCommerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said.    Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer --Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty.    Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S.supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986,the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons ofBrazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.    Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallontariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said.    An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its finalreport on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22.    Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order andtransmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entriesdating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessingduties, Vastagh said.    He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters,including three major shippers, would be affected by thedecision. Reuter
