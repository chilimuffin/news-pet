GERMAN INSTITUTE SEES INFLATION RISING IN 1987 The cost of living in West Germany willlikely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986,when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct inthe first recurrence of "negative inflation" since the 1950s, theHWWA economic research institute said.    The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from thefading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and thevalue of the dollar, the institute said in a report.    The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in thecourse of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as awhole because year on year rates will remain negative in thefirst part of 1987.    Provisional inflation figures for February released lastweek showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lowerthan in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pctagainst the same month a year earlier.

INFLATION STILL A CONCERN, VOLCKER SAYS Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said both the Fed and the financial markets remainconcerned about the possibility of renewed inflation.    "A possibility of renewed inflation remains of concern,both in the markets and within the Federal Reserve," he said inremarks prepared for delivery to a group of business leadershere.    He said one potential channel for renewed inflationarypressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in theexchange markets, which would push import prices up sharply.    He said participants in financial markets and businessremain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability.    "Should the skepticism about our ability to resistinflation be reinforced by bad policy, the consequences forinterest rates, for exchange rates, and for the economygenerally would clearly be undesirable...recognition of thatdanger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation ofmonetary policy," the Fed chairman said.    Volcker said attempts to drive the dollar much lower wouldundermine the hard won gains against inflation and would riskdissipating the flow of foreign capital. Reuter

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT A year after squeezing to power with anarrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister JacquesChirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulationschoking the French economy.    But France is still waiting for a promised industrialrecovery the government says will follow from its free marketpolicies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. Butso is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a yearand the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pctin 1986, is uncertain.    Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growthtarget and raise its inflation estimate, Finance MinisterEdouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. Butsome government supporters say they fear time for an economicmiracle may be running out.    The political clock is ticking towards Presidentialelections due by April next year.    France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast ofright-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixedreviews from non-partisan analysts.    For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies atnewly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstandingachievement has been to launch "a veritable intellectualrevolution" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries ofstate control.    "The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --but set in their context of structural reforms, they areexcellent," Develle said.    But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chiefarchitect of the government's free market policies, may bepursuing a mirage.    "The belief that economic liberalism will produce anexplosion of economic forces is ideological" said Indosuez chiefeconomist Jean Cheval. "Personally I think it's an illusion.Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system,from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible."    Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controlshave been largely abolished, labour regulations have beenpruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugelypopular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banksand industries to private investors.    Since December, nearly five mln French investors havebought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA> and glassmaker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA <SGEP.PA>, the first two statecompanies brought to the stock market under the 300 billionfranc five-year privatisation plan.    Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports ofcapital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money hasflooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to liftthe market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct sinceDecember.    At the end of last year the government abolished pricecontrols that had existed for 42 years on services such as carrepairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention smallbusinesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.    The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer pricesin January, partly responsible for a forced revision in theofficial 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct orless.    "But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when youconsider that prices are now free for the first time since1945," commented Develle of Paribas.    Other achievements include a major reduction in the state'sforeign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target anddown from 153.3 billion in 1985.    But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and agradual improvement in industrial productivity, the Frenchfranc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliatingthree pct devaluation against the West German mark, its secondsince Chirac took power.    A recent report by the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development pilloried French industry forfailing to produce the goods that its potential customerswanted.    Outside the mainly state-controlled high technologysectors, French industrial goods were "increasingly ill-adaptedto demand" and over-priced, the report said.    French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreedwith the report. "One of the assumptions of the government isthat if you give them freedom, the employers will invest andmodernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they likefreedom, and then wait to be told which way to go," he said.    And despite rising industrial investment and theintroduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.    The problem for the government is that there may be littlemore it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.    French producers failed more than most to take advantage oflast year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on theshaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries likeWest Germany and Japan, they say.

 French February inflation between 0.1 and 0.2 pct vs 0.9 pct in january -  U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for ashowdown between protectionists and free traders as a majortrade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by thefull House of Representatives in late April.    In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a keyHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned down version oflegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices.    This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional effortsto restore competitiveness of American industries and turnaround last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made toomany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to backamendments to "get tough" with countries that violate tradeagreements or keep out U.S. products.     On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegianceto free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much intrade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiatingpowers.    Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee'sbill was not one "that a free trader like me could endorse inall respects," but he emphasized there was a consensus amongtrade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicanswould ultimately endorse.    Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, "to make ourtrade policy stronger without violating our international tradeagreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have notdone the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven'tavoided violating agreements."    In a key concession made at the urging of the powerfulchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the tradesubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forcedReagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on importsfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices.    It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it wouldhurt the U.S. economy.    Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an IllinoisDemocrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary ifthe House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.    Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of atough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and thisyear only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when hesaw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill.    As an indication of his success, White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration stilldid not like some provisions. But he added, "Generally we feelvery good about the bipartisan consideration of the tradelegislation. I think we are progressing very well."    The first battle will take place next week when the fullHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries suchas Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluseswith the United States.    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide onlythat the existence of a large trade surplus with the UnitedStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,but would not automatically set off retaliation.    Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch freetrader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan.    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief fromimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered theadministration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan wouldsign would not be worth passage in Congress.    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in astatement, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please LaneKirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signedby the president."    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls fortrade relief for specific industries such as textiles.    Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to holdoff his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protectthe domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reaganvetoed a similar measure last year.    House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of themost influential proponents of aid for specific industriesbeset by low priced foreign competition.    Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for thedomestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senateplan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when importsreach half of domestic consumption.    For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S.enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administrationto act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such asdumping products in the United States at prices below the costof production.    It also forces the administration to act rapidly when anindustry complains that a surge in imports threatens itsexistence. Congressmen said the change would have required theU.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on carimports in 1981. Reuter

But he said work in the coordinating committees had alreadyrun into difficulties before Brazil's interest moratorium.    Justified calls by debtors for more flexibility from thebanks were blocked because U.S. Regulations made solutions suchas capitalising of interest virtually impossible, he said.    Although many European banks were opposed to the use ofinterest capitalisation, "this was an alternative which has tobe brought in," Sarrazin said. REUTER

U.S. PRICE DATA SUGGEST MODERATE INFLATION Latest consumer price data indicateU.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will beabove last year's pace, economists said.    "Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this timelast year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,"said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.    U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer priceindex for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices,which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced amore moderate 1.9 pct last month.    The CPI came within the range of economists' expectationsand had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.    Among the key components of the report, transportationprices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gainreflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels anddeclines in new car prices and finance charges.    "There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,"said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    Economists said the latest CPI supports existingexpectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.    The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986.Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.    Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as aresult of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energycomponent warrant attention in case gains in these areas becomefactored into the wider economic picture.    "As long as those price rises do not become entrenched incost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thusreducing international competitiveness, then the FederalReserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pctinflation," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G.

De la Dehesa said the March rise, announced today by theNational Statistics Institute, was not entirely satisfactorybut acceptable.

VENEZUELA APPROVES WAGE INCREASES, PRICE CONTROLS Venezuelan president Jaime Lusinchiapproved a general wage increase in the form of bonuses rangingfrom 20 to 30 pct and a 120-day price freeze on a basket ofbasic consumer goods.    Both measures, which take effect on May 1, were approved bythe cabinet. They will be announced to the nation by Lusinchiin a televised address tonight but the text of the decrees wasreleased this afternoon.    Businessmen, who met Lusinchi, opposed the pay rise, sayingit will fuel inflation. The inflation rate was 11.5 pct in 1986and private economists say it will be 25 to 30 pct in 1987.    The central bank said first quarter inflation was 6.3 pct.    The wage increase for public and private sector employeeswill be 30 pct on salaries of up to 2,100 bolivars a month. Forsalaries of from 2,101 to 6,100 bolivars 25 pct and for thoseof 6,101 to 20,000 bolivars 20 pct.    The measures were taken in response to a request from theVenezuelan confederation CTV for an increase to offset the lossin the purchasing power of workers' salaries. It estimated theloss at 40 pct.    The general wage rise is the third granted by Lusinchisince his government took office in February 1984.    The wage increases are a bonus and will not be consideredin calculating benefits or severance pay, the decree said.    At the same time, Lusinchi declared a freeze on lay-offsand firings for the next 120 days.    The price freeze applies to a group of 120 foods and otherconsumer goods declared to be "of primary necessity."    It does not apply to prices charged by agriculturalproducers or to goods for which the price is falling.

PHILIPPINE INFLATION PREDICTED TO RISE The Philippine 1987 inflation rate willrise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the governmentimplements an employers' association recommendation for a 10pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.    The government's own proposal for an across-the-board dailypay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eightpesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year averagehigher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.    The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by theEmployers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).    The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflationrate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solitasaid. Both were proposed last month.    Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pctby the National Economic and Development Authority early thismonth.    In the first three months of the year, inflation was anegative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National StatisticsOffice said.    The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pctin July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and Septemberrespectively, the National Statistics Office said.    It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and waterprices.    The government's six and eight peso wage increases woulddisplace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the numberof unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population. REUTER
