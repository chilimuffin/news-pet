GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH A study on grain certificates due outshortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could showthat certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more thancash outlays, administration and industry sources said.    Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the AgricultureDepartment and the Office of Management and Budget suggeststhat certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO officialtold Reuters.    GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specificrequest of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of thesenate agriculture committee.    The report, which will focus on the cost of certificatescompared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.    The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends onthe program's impact on the USDA loan program.    If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loanentries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost ofthe program would go up. However, if it is determined thatcertificates have caused the government grain stockpile todecrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.    GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificatesprogram should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.    But a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fireagainst certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increasein the certificate program," an agricultural consultant said.    The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,while USDA remains firmly committed to it. Reuter
U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT The U.S. Agriculture Department is notactively considering offering subsidized wheat to the SovietUnion under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDAofficials said.    However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has notbeen ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not inthe very near future.    "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But therejust isn't much talk about it, informally or formally."    Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confidentthan USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to theSoviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offerwhen they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlierthis week.    But administration and private sources agreed that if theReagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat toMoscow, it could take several months.    "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through anyinteragency process," the aide to Lyng said.    "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"said one former USDA official, who noted that theadministration took three months to decide in favor of sellingChina wheat under the subsidy program.    An official representing a large grain trade company saiddeliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members ofCongress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheatsubsidy offer to the Soviets.    But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit toCapitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press thesecretary on the subsidy question a single time.    The administration's interagency trade policy review group,comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked toclear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officialsat the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.    In their talks this week, the two sides discussed theadministration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about anynew initiative. One USDA official who took part in theconsultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm,basic, factual economics."    Another USDA official said there was "not even an informalsuggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to theirpledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they weregranted more favorable terms.    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of anEEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would bedelayed because of disarray within the White House stemmingfrom the Iran arms affair.

USDA SAID UNLIKELY TO BROADEN CORN BONUS OFFER The U.S. Agriculture Departmentprobably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment tocorn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in theconservation reserve program last year, an aide to USDASecretary Richard Lyng said.    Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng hadindicated he would consider giving those farmers the same twodlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987program this month.    But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that thedepartment would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers whoenrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year.    "How are you going to stop the tide," he said, referring todemands that would follow from other commodity groups. Reuter
RELIEF TO U.S. CORN/OATS GROWERS SAID LIKELY U.S. farmers who in the past havegrown oats for their own use but failed to certify to thegovernment that they had done so probably will be allowed tocontinue planting that crop and be eligible for corn programbenefits, an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.    Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn programbenefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops tothe acreage base for that crop.    Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained thatfarmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grownoats for their own use in the past now are being asked to haltoats production or lose corn program benefits.    USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oatsbut not extend the exemption to all farmers, Lyng's aide said. Reuter

INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW Indonesia"s agriculture sector will growby just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pctin 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates ordeclines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.    Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast tofall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report onIndonesia"s agricultural performance.    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in1987.    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mlntonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because ofa drawdown on stocks.    "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not lookpromising as rice production is forecast to decline and theproduction of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or nogain," the report says.    "The modest overall increase which is expected will be dueto significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oiland palm kernels."    Constraints to significant overall increases inagricultural output include a shortage of disease resistantseeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance byfarmers to shift from rice production to other crops, thereport underlines.    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak ofpests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 whichlargely offset gains in yields.    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are nowresistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, moreresistant rice types.    The government is depending on increased production ofexport commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood andpalm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crudeoil prices.    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pctin 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports risingto an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, thereport says.    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) willrise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports willalso rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybeanmeal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of lastSeptember"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a risein domestic demand.    The report said that Indonesia"s overall economicperformance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slightnegative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pctin 1984.    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsiblefor the slump. REUTER

CONSOLIDATED TVX SAYS IT WILL ISSUE SHARES TO BUY STAKES IN THREE BRAZIL MINI Brazil is not happy with the existingstructure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinatesits commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.    U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committeewhile holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said,adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks."The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,however.    Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese andEuropean banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adoptan approach involving separate discussions with the regions.    Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on acase-by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply tocreditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said.    Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interestpayments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followedlast week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines depositedby foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.    Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week inWashington talking to government officials and internationalagencies and will this week visit Britain, France, WestGermany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions withgovernments.    Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe andGovernor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.    Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K.The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan.    The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chiefmeans of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharplyand the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in thecountry'sate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to havedropped below four billion dlrs.    Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problemswith Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve onlypartial servicing of the debt.    "What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinancefor part of the service, because we cannot service all that," hesaid. "I really think we have to change the old rules."    Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, ratherthan the commercial banks themselves in its search for asolution to the crisis, Funaro said "We must first talk to thegovernments and then we can talk to the banks, because thebanks have some limits."    "It is a political discussion from our point of view," hesaid.    Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk toJapanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talkto the commercial banks "If I've got some solution from thegovernments. I can't take the burden only to the banks." He wasnot sure how long it would take to reach a solution.   In discussions with governments Brazil would review themechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations inneed. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtuallyclosed since 1982. "You must open these mechanisms," he said.    He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed byBrazil's suspension of interest payments, they understoodBrazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves.    Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed "becausewe can't stay as we were the last few years."    "I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of uswould like to have a kind of equilibrium." he said. AlthoughBrazil has rejected a substantive role for the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy, Funaro paid a callin Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and toWorld Bank President Barber Conable.    Funaro noted that inflation in February had started todecline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eightbillion dlr trade surplus in 1987.    Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus haddeclined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of lastyear, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months.    Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world,Funaro said, although its share of international trade was onlyone pct.  "The solution is linked with growth, not recession," hesaid, noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports andinducing an internal recession in order to service debt.    Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments,as opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounderstructure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Clubof creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt.

TRADERS DETAIL FRENCH CEREAL EXPORT REQUESTS French operators last Friday requestedlicences to export 10,500 tonnes of free market maize, 11,950tonnes of free market barley and 13,000 of soft wheat flour tonon-EC countries, at prefixed daily (droit commun) rebates,French trade sources said.    The latest requests for the maize were for export toSwitzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebateprefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20Ecu daily rebate.    The special daily rebate for maize was set in the contextof a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for theexport of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries,in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recentdispute over grain sales to Spain.    If the latest French requests are accepted as expected,this will bring the total of French maize exported in thiscontext to 25,500 tonnes.    The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for thesale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.    Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austriaand Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixedrestitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheatflour were for export to various non-EC countries at anunchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.

CANADA RULING ON U.S. CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK The Canadian government is expectedto announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. cornexports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S.government and farm group representatives said.    The deadline for a final determination is March 7.    U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in asimilar case covering European pasta imports. In that case,Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of theCanadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. cornexports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.    Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. cornimports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts lastmonth because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION All major grain producing countriesmust do their part to help reduce global surpluses and therecent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S.wheat organizations said.    The recent Australian proposals were a good starting pointfor discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feelthey are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on worldgrain trade, the president of the National Association of WheatGrowers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates saidin a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.    Future discussions on international wheat trade shouldinclude three topics -- a commitment to privatization ofgovernment-run export trading entities, a commitment to publicdisclosure of sales and other terms if government entities areinvolved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, thetwo organizations said     While the Australian proposals are welcome the twoorganizations said they are not in total agreement with theirassessments.    Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. targetprices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue toplace the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.farmers, they said.      Other countries, including Australia, have benefittedfrom the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S.acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.    "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- andsubsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stockinggrain and changing programs which protect our growers," JimMiller, president of NAWG said.    "We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among theworld's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks andrestore profitability to agriculture," Miller said. Reuter

USSR WHEAT BONUS RUMORS PERSIST DESPITE DENIALS Grain trade representatives continuedto speculate that the Reagan administration will offersubsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. AgricultureDepartment officials said there was no substance to thereports.    "It's pure fiction," said one senior official at USDA'sForeign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that theadministration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscowin the next two to three weeks.    An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked notto be identified said there was nothing to substantiate thespeculation, which he said was started by "somebody fanning the(wheat) market." Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on thebasis of the speculation.    One lobbyist with close connections to the Reaganadministration said a Soviet trade team told private graintrade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy asmuch as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it beforemid-year, if it was "competitively priced."    Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet tradingorganization, told Reuters he had no information tosubstantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, butsaid that Moscow "would consider" buying U.S. wheat if it wascompetitively priced.    "We don't care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) arelooking for is competitive prices," Ivlev said. "If they (theadministration) are interested in selling it (wheat), theyshould find ways to do it." Reuter
OFFICIAL INQUIRY SET FOR AUSTRALIAN WHEAT INDUSTRY The government's industry aid andprotection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission(IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheatindustry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said.    The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistanceto the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid,he said in a statement.    He said the inquiry will be the first step in settingmarketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when theunderwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat MarketingAct expire.    Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a fullexamination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.    "The inquiry will be required to take into account changeswhich have taken place in the industry as a result of theagricultural policies of major wheat producing countries andthe industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,"he said.    "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry,as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to triggerunderwriting support from the government for the first time," hesaid.    Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of theguaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the AustralianWheat Board near the start of the season.    The IAC's report will be due at the same time as thefindings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage,Handling and Transport, Kerin said.    He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow itsfindings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered inlater negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between thefederal and state governments and the industry.

YUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA There was no evidence of winterkillin Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a linerunning northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S.Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a fieldreport.    The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence ofdelayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fallbecause of dry conditions.    However warm temperatures over the past three weeks havepromoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up onlast fall's late seeding, it said.    Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about thesituation because warm temperatures have brought the grain outof dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, thereport said.    Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damageunder these conditions, they said.

Around 300 mln dlrs of the in-kind certificates, or"certs," will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16,Tom von Garlem, Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDA's stateand county operations, said.    The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certsratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will bedelayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA's computerprogram, von Garlem said.get 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts incerts and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman).    Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments atsignup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than halfof this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he saidthis will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since mostfarmers got advance payments.    "The final certificate payments will be very close to 300mln dlrs," he said.    When asked if the Office of Management and Budget hadresisted the cash/certs ratio, the USDA official said that "weproposed 50/50 and OMB accepted it." Reuter

SOVIET SOYMEAL IMPORTS SEEN RISING IN 1987 Soviet imports of soymeal may reach orexceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year,the Oil World newsletter said.    Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reducesoybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.    At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from theEuropean Community and South America in the January/Marchquarter, with additional large quantities likely to be importedin the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, itsaid. No figures were given for imports in the correspondingperiods of 1986.    The change made sense in view of the recent purchases ofprobably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseedand large scale butter imports that were expected from Marchonward, it said.    Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grainarea due to recent severe frosts were probably behind therecent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.

U.S. EXPORTERS REPORT 104,000 TONNES OF  CORN SOLD TO UNKNOWN DESTINATIONS FOR The specialty retailing area continuesto pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five anddime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.    It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases forthe New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 yearsago.    Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrsper share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrsper share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion comparedwith the prior year's 5.96 billion.    For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.    Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters thatincome generated by the company's specialty store operationsaccounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.    He said the company now has 4,700 specialty storesoperating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, itoperated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated byWoolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richmanapparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chainof discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discountdrug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, ofwhich 1,200 are in the United States.    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying asthey are an improvement over last year's record earnings."    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings ineach quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlierperiod.    Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount storeindustry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworthopened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the UnitedStates, although Woolco still operates in Canada.    In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy andannounced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square footthan general merchandise stores.    Reuter

SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE Soviet winter grains could be off toa faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry falland cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.    Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in theSoviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature toforecast any major crop problems, analysts said.    But the situation bears careful watching over the next sixweeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply andfuture buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.    "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty thatthe Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have alower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologistfor E.F. Hutton said.    The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas willbe the crucial period that will determine the final outcome ofthe winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.    "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead ofus," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.    The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectaresof winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter cropand would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, theUSDA analyst said.    With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be ableto reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analystsnoted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.    Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcovercombined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has beendue to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.    "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlationbetween mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said.    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normalin southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over theentire winter crop area, she said.    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which thesnowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, seniorforecaster for Accu Weather, said.    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of thefall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring wouldrequire longer off-pasture feeding, they said.    "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... theydon't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said.    But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops andif they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was aone-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Sovietbuying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.    Bad weather during the next six weeks could push theSoviets back into the market, weather analysts said.    "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month anda half," Martell said. Reuter
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA The Australian Government will likelyreimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, thedepartment said the sharp fall in world wheat prices hasreduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levelsinsufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated ataround 98 dlrs per tonne.     For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below thebreakeven export price, it said.    Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advancepayment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculatedat 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the currentyear and the two lowest of the previous three years, thedepartment said.    In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling andstorage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.    But the department said the Australian Bureau ofAgricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production willdrop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in1989/90.    The decline will result from low world grain prices leadingto shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.wheat exports, the department said. Reuter
EC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA The European Community, EC, sold75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuingbid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs pertonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latestreport on Export Markets for U.S grains.    EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes inthe 1985/86 season, it said.    The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at atime when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheatimport market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the currentforecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.    The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline indomestic production, and says government plans to lower theguaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrswill contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.    It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier ofthe additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase ofU.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

SOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA Despite earlier optimisticindications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stagein its development and recent reports of heat stress couldreduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, thedepartment said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87(Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pctfrom the previous year.    The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows aperiod of severe droughts, which at one point required SouthAfrica to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, itsaid.    Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facingincreased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.    But if South Africa is perceived as lacking availablesupplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, thedepartment said. Reuter
CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS Chicago Board of trade grain traders andanalysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned tohandle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of newcrop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeansin the futures markets.    Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers willbe more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans becausecorn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That givesdeficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if theysign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thingrather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new cropsoybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans moreattractive under normal circumstances.    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift thelimited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mlnmore oat acres this year than last without being penalized,traders said.    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking ofshifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to themore attractive deal from the government, they added.    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just sixmonths ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South toput soybean land back into cotton.    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybeanproduction in recent years has been a general shift of acres intraditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE The 350 mln Ecu three-year package ofsocial and structural measures agreed early today by EuropeanCommunity farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmersfor reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commissionsources said.    The ministers agreed that under this "extensification"scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cutoutput of specific products by at least 20 pct.    The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal andwine, they added.    Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts byreducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce theirnumber of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case,farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacityfor output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.    The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed butwill be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit onthe production they forego.    The sources said the package also contains provisions forpayments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protectingor improving the environment.    It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favouredfarming areas would be extended to crops. At present suchallowances are available only for livestock.    The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research intoalternative farming techniques, the sources added.    At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessensaid the Commission is also working on proposals to enable theEC and member states to provide direct income supports forrelatively poor farmers.    Andriessen did not give full details, but said member stateaid would be subject to "strict criteria to avoid distortion ofcompetition."    EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive adifficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplusproduction.    The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last nightproposals to pay "early retirement" pensions to farmers aged 55or over who gave up production. Those who took their landcompletely out of farm production, rather than passing it on totheir heirs, would have received more generous payments.    Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revisedproposals along these lines in an effort to get a schemeagreed. Reuter

TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST Torrential rains throughoutArgentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarsegrain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.    Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularlyaffected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid tosoybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April orMay.    The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghumcrops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yieldsand cut the total volume of this year's harvest.    Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.    No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.    Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume ofthe coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.    Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central SantaFe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct oftotal planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.    Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest wasestimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two toseven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the1985/86 harvest.    Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according toofficial figures.    The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and ninepct of total planted area.    Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowersfor this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figureof 3.14 mln hectares.    Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mlnand 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the1985/86 harvest.    Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two andfour pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mlnhectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.    Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.    Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit arecord 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figuresput last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.    Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very goodcondition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.    Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest isexpected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares. Reuter
IZVESTIA SAYS SOVIET WINTER CROPS NEED RESEEDING The government daily Izvestia said aconsiderable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseededand the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes willnot be easy to fulfil.    Without giving figures, the newspaper said: "A considerablepart of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that createsextra effort in the fields in spring."    The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares ofwinter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill.    A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington hassaid the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pctof the total winter crop and would be the second highestwinterkill in 10 years.    "The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnesof grain is not simple," Izvestia said.    This week's sudden fall in temperatures has affected largeparts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in theUkraine, it said, adding that temperatures fell to as low asminus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia.

U.S. SENATE PANEL MAKES CONSERVATION EXEMPTION The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committeeapproved a measure that would exempt farmers who plantedalfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and1985 from a federal conservation requirement.    Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb., said his bill would restoreequity under federal sodbuster rules, which currently deny farmprogram benefits to farmers who, between 1981 and 1985, plantedalfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes withoutinterrupting the plantings with a row crop.    An official from a leading conservation group, who askednot to be identified, said the panel's move was "an unfortunatefirst action" because it could lead to the exemption ofpotentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations,established under the 1985 farm bill.

FRENCH WHEAT EXPORTS TO EC FALL French soft wheat exports to otherEuropean Community countries fell 18 pct to 4.13 mln tonnes inthe first seven months of the 1986/87 season to Januarycompared with 5.04 mln in the same 1985/86 period, the FrenchCereals Intervention Office (ONIC) said.    According to latest ONIC statistics, the main buyers wereItaly with 1.89 mln against 1.63 mln in the same 1985/86period, West Germany 480,450 tonnes against 717,689, theNetherlands 462,048 (532,299) and Belgium 417,887 tonnes(919,337).    British and Greek imports of French soft wheat during thisperiod were below year-ago levels. Between July 1 last year andJanuary 31, Britain bought 274,665 tonnes against 642,800tonnes, ONIC figures showed.    But Spanish purchases were up sharply at 258,507 tonnesagainst 2,751 tonnes in the same 1985/86 period and Portugalbought 37,599 tonnes compared with zero.    ONIC said the drop in French exports to other Communitycountries was due to British competition. Reuter
ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC The size of French 1986/87 carryoverbarley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French CerealsIntervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.    He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at theend of February from the previous month while export forecastswere lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.    Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding alarger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets areopened for French barley a large amount could be put intointervention.    A small amount of French barley has already been put intointervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.    The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exportsto non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in1985/86.    The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decisionto hold special export tenders for French maize, he said. Reuter
CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES The Canadian Wheat Board has advisedthe federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid tofarmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop yearbeginning August 1, a board spokesman said.    The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommendedprice drops but said it would not be good news for westernCanadian grain growers.    "They're all lower," he said. "This is really gettingpretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survivaland whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."    Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board willrecommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.    Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain isdelivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.    If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, thefarmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. Ifprices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.    The final decision on the initial prices, usually made inApril, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and thefederal cabinet.    Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27pct but last fall the government announced a one billionCanadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.    But federal agricultural officials have already warnedfarmers not to depend on additional government aid this year. Reuter
RENEWAL OF U.S./USSR GRAIN PACT SAID UNCERTAIN Prospects for renewal of thefive-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at thispoint, a Soviet trade official told Reuters.    The current trade imbalance between the United States andthe Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increasedworld grain production make a renewal of the supply agreementnext year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy traderepresentative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview.    The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988.    Melnikov said that world grain markets are different thanwhen the first agreement was signed in 1975.    Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials haveindicate that a long term grains agreement might not be asattractive for both sides as it once was.    "We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement,but with the second agreement we've had difficulties withprices," Melnikov said.    "I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the futureabout the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what willhappen after Sept 30, 1988," he said.    Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Sovietgovernment officials that they would be pushing for a renewalof the agreement.    "The situation is different in comparison to three, five orten years ago ... We can produce more," he said. Reuter
MORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE Whether the Soviet Union will fulfillits buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreementdepends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade officialtold Reuters.    "How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreementif the United States does not want to offer us grain atcompetitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy traderepresentative of the Soviet Union to the United States.    "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to theUnited States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitiveprices," he said in an interview.    Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up theagreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain atprevailing market prices.    "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said.    Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales ofcommodities under this Agreement will be made at the marketprice prevailing for these products at the time ofpurchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms."    "The United States should supply to the Soviet Uniondefinite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is theUnited States ready to supply this?" he said.    The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand hasbeen met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which heconfirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn pricesremain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.    Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.    "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat,then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to theUnited States to decide how these competitive prices will beoffered," he said.    Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Sovietswas rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer,U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.

AMERICAN FARM BUREAU OPPOSES FARM BILL CHANGES The directors of the American FarmBureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesdayto urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place withoutalterations.    "We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,"said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has beenin place for just a little over a year and in our judgmentthere is more to be gained at the present time from maintainingthe legislation.    "Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farmbill is better on balance than any of the alternatives beingadvanced," Kleckner said.    The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much ashe deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeanscompetitive in the world market.    A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should beeligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIKcertificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel andthe new loan rate.    The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiencypayments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheatbecause of adverse weather. Reuter

UNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER AFFECTS CHINA'S AGRICULTURE Abnormally warm and dry weather over mostparts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China NewsAgency said.    It said the drought has made rice planting difficult ineight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plantdiseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producingareas, it said.    The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi andother provinces have been suffering a drought for more thanseven months.    The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount ofwater stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March,lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectricpower supplies and caused water shortages for industry andconsumers.    The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levelsin a century, causing many ships to run aground and makingharbour manoeuvres difficult, it said.    The drought has also increased the number of forest fires.More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340hectares of forest by mid-February, it said. REUTER

HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE A House Agriculture Committee meetinglater today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark adebate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or"de-coupling," provision to cover feedgrains, and those whooppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sourcessaid.    The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winterwheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting andstill receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.    The administration has strongly urged that the bill beexpanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provisionwill emerge from the committee, the sources said.    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are largeestimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimatesby the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at thistime is the major reason cited by those against an expansion ofthe bill, committee staffers said.    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. Aconflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, andstaffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of anexpanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas ofthe country will be underway in the next few weeks and signupfor the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, sosomething has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to beimplemented, an Agriculture Department source said.    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in lastweek's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommitteechairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of theconsequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings wasnecessary.    Major commodity groups, including the National CornGrowers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen'sAssociation, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the billcurrently is not equitable for all grains producers, so itshould be extended to other crops.    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, saidGene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try todecrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in thedebate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introducea bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with theargument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any majorchanges in the farm bill.    "Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of thetiming," a congressional staff member said.    Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have anamendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988feedgrains. Reuter

That provision was later broadened by thesubcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.    Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but stillcollect 92 pct of deficiency payments.    Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponeduntil next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid billand 0/92.    The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot programfollows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influentialfarm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.    Congressional sources said there has not been enough timeto study the implications of a broad 0/92.    "The timing (of the proposal) is off," said one aide to aHouse Agriculture committee member.    However, several Congressional sources said they expect abroader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the HouseAgriculture committee is faced next month with the need to makespending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as partof an overall deficit reduction package.    Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley(D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts mayexceed one billion dlrs.    A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both theCongressional Budget Office and the Reagan administrationestimate it would result in significant budget savings.    A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5billion dlrs over five years.    Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is theapproach of planting season, Congressional sources said.    Some officials said it already is late for implementationof a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 forwheat and feedgrains.    If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up eitherwould have to be extended or reopened, sources said. Reuter

ARGENTINA-BRAZIL TRADE JUMPED 90 PCT IN 1986 Trade between Argentina and Braziljumped 90 pct in 1986 versus 1985, Foreign Minister DanteCaputo said.    Speaking to reporters, Caputo said the near doubling intrade showed the "tangible and immediate results" of a wide-ranging economic integration accord signed by the presidents ofboth countries last July.    He said trade last year totalled 1.3 billion dlrs versus700 mln dlrs in 1985.    The accord provided for capital goods trade between the twocountries to rise to 2.0 billion dlrs over four years.

CANADA RULES U.S. CORN INJURING CANADIAN FARMERS, UPHOL Dome Petroleum Ltd's 23.2 pct stake ofgold producer Dome Mines Ltd continues to be for sale "at theright price," spokesman David Annesley said in response to aninquiry.    Reaffirming remarks made last year by chairman HowardMacdonald, Annesley said the company is considering selling itsstake in Dome Mines.    Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in <Encor EnergyCorp Ltd>, Annesley said "Encor is a strategic investment forDome, and we have no intention of selling it."    Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question thathe was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward thesale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares.    He also declined to specify at what price the company wouldconsider selling it shares.    "Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (ofDome Mines stock) are very attractive," Annesley commented.    "We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a timewhen the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs," he added. Aprice of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered "fairlyattractive," Annesley said.    Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its DomeMines' shares at a premium to market prices. "There might be anopportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would bevirtually a control block in Dome Mines," he said.    Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 onthe Toronto Stock Exchange.    Dome Petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructuredebt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs with a group of 56major creditors, which includes Dome Mines and Encor Energy.

In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, NAWGstated its "strong support" for an eep offer to Moscow.    "We believe that a solid case continues to exist for SovietEEP eligibility, and the recently announced and reported Sovietpurchases of U.S. corn indicate a Soviet willingness topurchase U.S. grain if it is competitively priced," NAWG said.

CANADA CORN DECISION UNJUSTIFIED - YEUTTER U.S. trade representative ClaytonYeutter said Canada's finding announced today that U.S. cornimports injure Canadian farmers is "totally unjustified."    "U.S. corn exports to Canada are so small that it isinconceivable that they injure Canadian corn farmers by anyreasonable measure," Yeutter said in a statement.    He said if other countries follow Canada's lead it couldresult in "a rash of protectionist actions throughout theworld." French corn growers have recently indicated they willchallenge U.S. corn gluten feed shipments to Europe.

MGE PLANNING APRIL 6 START UP OF HFCS CONTRACT The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE)will start trading futures contracts in high fructose cornsyrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.    Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchangeexpects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It hasbeen under review since the exchange submitted the proposal inDecember, 1985.    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tanktruck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wetmilling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is mostcommonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and otherbeverages.    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from productionfacilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designatedby the symbol "HF," would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Monthstraded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months ofMarch, May, July, September and December.    Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with aminimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuationof one dlr per CWT.    "We hope the producers and users of fructose will beactively involved, those producers being the large processors,the corn wet millers, and the users being the beveragebottlers," Henderson said. "But there are potentials for alltypes of people to use it. There is quite a list of industriesthat utilize fructose." Reuter

U.S. FEEDGRAIN 0/92 SUPPORTERS EVALUATE POSITION Advocates of a 0/92 plan forfeedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if adisaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee isscaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressionalsources said.    The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English(D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals toimplement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.    An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even thatscaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.    Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains shouldbe treated equally, they said.   If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, thensupporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably notoffer their proposals next week, sources said.   English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. CharlesStenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, butwhether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.    Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's firstchoice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheatfarmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aidfor winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because ofcontroversy over spring wheat, then English might consider aneven greater cutback in the bill, they said.    Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and stillreceive 92 pct of deficiency payments.    Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill toinclude a 0/92 program for feedgrains.    An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farmbill, but to be fair to all crops.    Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers wouldlikely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant aregreater than to idle the land, economists said.    Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it ispremature to make major changes in the farm bill and that theHouse Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely theimpacts of such a program.

U.S. CORN GROWERS BLAST CANADA CORN RULING Canada's ruling in favor of a duty onU.S. corn was a keen disappointment to the National CornGrowers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for othernations to follow, said Mike Hall, lobbyist for theassociation.    "The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now andjust change corn to corn gluten feed" in their complaint, Halltold Reuters.    A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farmpolicies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers andsupported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85cts per bushel.    "This was cleary a political decision," Hall said. "Theamount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant."    The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrumentthat Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices andthat American farm policy has driven down these prices, thuscausing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger governmentpayments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.    Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but thatother nations might also now apply this same argument to attackU.S. farm programs.    The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farmprograms create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hallsaid. The French have long wanted to control the imports ofU.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that theimported feed was unfairly displacing European grain. Reuter

The tribunal upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S.cents a bushel.

USDA RAISES SOVIET GRAIN IMPORT ESTIMATE The U.S. Agriculture Departmentincreased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes.    In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA saidthe increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to theU.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat andcoarse grain from other major suppliers.    USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up onemln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below thepreliminary 1985/86 figure.    Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mlntonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along witha dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and acold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.    USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightlyfrom the previous January's level, while milk productionincreased by nearly six pct.    Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases inroughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestockproduction from expanding as much as it did a year earlier,USDA said. Reuter

CBT DISCUSSES MAJOR CHANGES FOR RENOVATION Chicago Board of Trade (CBT)agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for aperiod of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goesahead with planned renovation.    A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at anumber of options to identify the most cost effective andefficient way to proceed, including one which would involvemoving the entire grains floor out of the building and into thenearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange.    "One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items hasbeen to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,"the spokesman said.    Another CBT official, executive vice president GeorgeSladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at aspecial meeting on the exchange floor.    A number of presentations have been made with regard torenovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. "We'velooked at five or six different alternatives, involving suchthings as flip-flopping the trading rooms," he added.    It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, wemight use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBTmarkets, Sladoje said.    "If we move out of one floor entirely, then theconstruction period will be about a year," he said, adding thatthe issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and thenbe on the drawing board for eight months to a year.    The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were verypreliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin untilthis summer at the earliest.    In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits,exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporaryhome next door in the present grains-dominated area.    This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bondfutures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds andT-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing theMidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat,soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options.    Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBTmembers.    One senior floor trader said the financial futures roombadly needs renovating.    "There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm andthe financials will move to the grains area," he said.    The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed wasto renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at atime. "The first step, after deciding the most effective way toproceed, would be to get architectural and engineeringdrawings," he said.    He added that it was difficult at present to determine anexact time frame for any possible moves. "This is a majorundertaking and a process that would spread out over nextyear," he said.    Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, whichmerged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparingto vacate their floor at the end of this month.    Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT bymoving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reservedfor lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now sharetheir trading area.    The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains,livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well assome options contracts.    "Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over herebecause the bonds are too crowded," one MidAm trader said.    Another source at the MidAm said this change could takeplace by July or August.

MARKET DISCOUNTS HIGHER SOVIET GRAIN IMPORTS Grain analysts said the increase ofthree mln tonnes in 1986/87 Soviet grain imports is unlikely toaffect the market Tuesday.    They said the market already has discounted higher Sovietimports, partly on news last month that the Soviet Union boughtone mln tonnes of U.S. corn, and on rumors that the Reaganadministration is pushing for authority to sell the SovietsU.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.    In its supply-demand report, the USDA raised its estimatefor 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln.    "That was business already done, for all practicalpurposes," said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson,reflecting similar statements made by other analysts. Reuter
USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT The Soviet Union will likely honorits commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of fourmln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Departmentofficial said.    "They have always honoured the agreement, and there's noreason now to think they won't this year," he told Reuters.    "They have an aggressive buying campaign from the EuropeanCommunity, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyersfrom all sources at this point," the official said inexplaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain importsestimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.    This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago whenanalysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn forthe first time in 15 years.    A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concernover Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S.corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow'srecent interest.    Lower corn production prospects in some major supplyingcountries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan,and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, theofficial said.    "The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists"and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. "Assoon as they need corn, they'll buy it," he added.    USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to theSoviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said thepurchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.    The USDA official would not speculate on when the Sovietswould enter the U.S. market again.    "There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from thesituation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one offrenetic buying now," the official said.    However, the situation in wheat is "a different story," hesaid. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchasecommitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Sovietpurchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.    Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S.is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer tothe Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation. Reuter
SICHUAN BRACED TO FIGHT DROUGHT The Sichuan government has ordered thatany work or meeting which interferes with the fight againstdrought must be cancelled or postponed to save time, energy andmanpower, the People's Daily domestic edition said.    Sichuan is one of six provinces threatened by drought.    Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily, said the drought, the worstfor more than 20 years, is affecting nearly two mln hectares in100 counties in Sichuan, the country's biggest agriculturalproducer.    Sichuan has experienced temperatures three degreesCentigrade higher than normal and rainfall up to 70 pct lessthan normal since early February, affecting wheat, oil-bearingcrops, rice planting and dryland cash crops, it said.    The paper said 43,000 hectares in Meixian county inGuangdong are seriously short of water.    The People's Daily said Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hebei arealso suffering from drought.    Henan's grain output fell by 2.5 mln tonnes last year fromthe 1985 level because of drought which has been affecting theprovince since May. REUTER
CHINA BUYS U.S. HARD AND SOFT WHEAT Private exporters said China bought atotal of 550,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat under the exportenhancement program, with final confirmation by the U.S.Department of Agriculture of the subsidies still awaited.

DOLE SAYS 0/92 OPTION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED U.S. Senate Republican leader RobertDole said Congress should consider legislation to apply theso-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities.    Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that hethought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration,"should be seriously considered" because a refusal to do so could"play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls" placedon production.    However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of theirincome support payments regardless of how much they planted.    The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed twoproblems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. Inaddition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farmbill, Dole said.    Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board exportenhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Unioncould help improve U.S. relations with that country.    Dole said that the United States has made the decision totrade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitiveprices.    The senator predicted Congress would have to decide thisyear whether to require an expansion of the export subsidyprogram, which currently targets benefits to recapture marketslost to other suppliers which subsidize.    Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to requirea marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again calledfor the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains.    The Reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes"are not going anywhere" this year, Dole said, singling out theproposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year.    Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed ashift in the State Department towards supporting an exportenhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said hedidn't see any change.    Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senatewhether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year.    Dole said he was encouraged by the selection of RepublicanDavid Karnes to replace the late Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.) Reuter
DOLE MULLS BILL TO EXTEND ETHANOL TAX EXEMPTION U.S. Senate Republican leader RobertDole (R-Kan.) said he and a group of Republican lawmakers areconsidering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol taxexemption through the year 2000.    Dole, addressing the National Corn Growers Associationboard, said the proposal was under consideration by a ruraltask force of Republican members of Congress and governors.    Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives asix cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excisetax. The exemption is to expire the end of 1992.    Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusinessfirms including Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and A.E. Staley.The tax exemption has helped bolster ethanol production despitea sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil. Reuter

U.S. CORN DEMAND GROWING IN JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA The recent purchase of 1.5 mlntonnes of U.S. corn by Japan and 600,000 tonnes by South Koreasuggests that the two countries' demand for reliable suppliesof corn is increasing, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In its World Production and Trade Report, the departmentsaid that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline inexportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over theavailability of South African and Chinese corn.    With these corn purchases, Japan is committed to buying 7.7mln tonnes of U.S. corn in 1986/87 (Sept-Aug), nearly 400,000tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date.

BIG U.S. CONSERVATION ENROLLMENT EXPECTED Enrollment in the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's fourth conservation signup is expected to beannounced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may behigher than total enrollment for the first three signups.    Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres,USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far inthe 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.    Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres intothe program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA'sAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at acongressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will beaccepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.    As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area isexpected to attract the greatest enrollment.    "The Great Plains area will be the predominate area whichwe'll get signup in," a USDA conservation specialist said.    Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of theacreage pulled from that area, he said.    Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreagein the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production,but the USDA source said this would be a relatively smallpercent of the total.    A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll partof their corn base acreage into the program has sparked moreinterest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.    Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to takeland out of production for 10 years. The average rent paymentaccepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre. Reuter
MORE HEAVY RAINS IN ARGENTINE GRAIN AREAS Heavy rains fell again inArgentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday,trade sources said.    Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularlyhigh volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa andSanta Fe provinces.    Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires,heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in LaPampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe.Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.    Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mmin Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm inChaco.    Growers said it was still too early to tell whether therains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflowercrops may have suffered.    Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed bythe bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rainswould have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allowfarm machinery to operate.    The rains caused flooding in western and northwesternBuenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areasthere since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.    Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares,Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said afterflying over the flooded area.    Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said largeparts of the flooded areas were not planted because they arelow-lying and flood easily.    Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by theheavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent ofthe damage. They said it was likely rain combined with highwinds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.    The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and southof Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolatedareas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pcta week ago.    Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop wererevised downward in light of the bad weather.    Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes,down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mlntonnes.    Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a weekago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated aweek ago.    Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes,according to official figures.    Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mlntonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mlntonnes, according to official figures.    Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching betweenfour and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to fourpct a week ago.    Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnesproduced in the last harvest. Reuter

AWB SAYS AUSTRALIAN WHEAT SALES OVER 10 MLN TONNES The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB)1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnesalready sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said.    "We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne exporttarget for the year," he said in a statement.    He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWBspokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, theSoviet Union and Iraq.    In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWBexported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.    Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest hasended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes deliveredto the AWB.    The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct ofreceivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said.    However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain wasstill being held on farms and further milling and feed wheatmay be delivered following the recent announcement of the finalGuaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said.    Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's FebruaryWheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes.    But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate couldturn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and thefinal crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes.The official estimate is not yet available.    In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes ofthe 16.13 mln tonne crop.    Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allowfarmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB'sreceival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economicsdata.

PORTUGAL GRAIN AGENCY BARRED FROM IMPORT TENDERS A Portuguese court has made apreliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPACshould not be allowed to take part in public import tendersopen to private importers, grain traders and officials said.    Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to theEuropean Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC(Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reducedby 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.    Private traders protested last year that EPAC was beingpermitted to take part in tenders open to them for the firstliberalised 20 pct share of the country's annual import needs.The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legalproceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders.    Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon's civilcourt, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not beallowed to take part in tenders open to private traders.    Trade sources said the ruling, though effectiveimmediately, was subject to appeal and would have to beconfirmed in further proceedings.    A member of the government Cereals Market Commission saidthat, as a result of the court's decision, the Commission wouldnot be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender beingheld today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn.    Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC'sparticipation in the public tenders violated the clauses ofPortugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradualdismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.    It also said the participation of EPAC, which stillcontrols the national grain storage and distribution network,was unfair competition to the private traders.    Traders said they believed the EC's Executive Commissionwas unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring toleave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue.    "They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile," onetrader said.    ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels ifnecessary. Reuter

U.S. TO ASK FOR SHARE OF JAPAN'S RICE MARKET U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice marketto U.S. exporters when he visits that country next month.    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said the Reaganadministration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on U.S. beefand citrus exports.    Lyng, who plans to be in Japan April 14-27, said he willnot ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market. "We will urgethat they consider sharing their rice market," he said.    The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of theJapanese rice market the U.S. would request. "We've got none ofit now. If we got one per cent of it, it would be a bigimprovement," he said.    Last year, the Reagan administration rejected a petition bythe U.S. rice industry seeking relief from Japanese importrestrictions.    However, the U.S. said it would reexamine the issue if bymid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to U.S. riceexports.    Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiationsnext month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas, butthat his visit "may be a forerunner in a general way" to talksprior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988.    He said, however, that the U.S. "will ask for a definiteliberalization of those items (beef and citrus).... When youtranslate 'liberalization' into Japanese, it means do away withthe quota." Reuter
LYNG SAYS NO DECISION ON SOVIET EEP OFFER U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said the Reagan administration had not decided on offeringthe Soviet Union subsidized wheat but that such an offer hadnot been ruled out.    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said that he had noknowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within thecabinet.    Asked if the administration had ruled out offering tosubsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Union under thedepartment's export enhancement program, Lyng said, "No. Wehaven't made a decision on it, haven't even talked about it,haven't even looked at it."    Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buyU.S. wheat if competitively priced, Lyng responded, "If they(the Soviets) would offer to buy some wheat, would we acceptit? It would depend on what price they offered."    Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheatwas far off the world price.    Asked about persistent speculation that the administrationwould offer Moscow a wheat subsidy, Lyng said, "Some peoplethink they're doing it to see if they can get a little spurt inthe market."

U.S.-SOVIET GRAIN ACCORD QUESTIONED BY LYNG U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he was not sure a long-term U.S.-Soviet grainagreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.    "It hasn't been worth much in the last two years....Theyhaven't lived up to the agreement as I see it," Lyng said in aninterview with Reuters.    "It would be my thought that it's not worth any effort towork out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement tobe a one-sided thing," he said.    However, Lyng said he did not want to make a "definitivecommitment one way or another at this point."    Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed tobuy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mlntonnes each of corn and wheat.    Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes ofwheat during the third agreement year, which ended lastSeptember, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.    Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscowwould buy this year.    "I've seen people making comments on that and I don't knowhow they know, unless they talk to the Soviets," he said. "I haveno knowledge, and I really don't think anyone other than theSoviets have any knowledge."    Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn lastmonth because "they needed it and because the price was right."    "Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. And I thinkthey've always found that our corn was good," he said. Reuter

GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0/92 FARM PLAN Implementation of a one-year 0/92pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promotedtoday by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommitteeas a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmersanother option when making their planting decisions.    "We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame,but we are locked into this," said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains. "We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt thefarmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both."    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 billfor 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickmansaid that it will probably be introduced next week.    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer toforego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiencypayment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided underthe current bill.    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meetbudget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better thansharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply adifferent type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from governmentpayments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at thispoint, he said.    "I don't think there is any interest in pursuing adecoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal," Glickman saidat the hearing.    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of theBoren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. Hisplan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment toparticipating farmers, require that idled acreage be put toconservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extraidled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acresin a county and provide tenant protection provisions.    "I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, butwe can at least move in that direction," Boschwitz said.    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testifiedin favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current biasin U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'dependency on the government, he said.    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnsonsaid, and would still encourage farmers to plant.    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association andthe National Cattlemen's Association said their groups opposeany 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening thefarm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.

CARGILL OFFICIAL DEFENDS CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS The use of generic in-kind commoditycertificates has helped ease storage problems and is anecessary part of export promotion programs, a senior executivefor the world's largest grain company said.    Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee onwheat, soybeans and feedgrains, Robbin Johnson, vice presidentof Cargill, Inc., disputed claims that U.S. grain companieshave made huge profits from certificate trading.    "The certs program is not in any way a windfall to thetrade," he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealingwith a two pct spread in certificate transactions, and thatthis is within the normal grain marketing levels.    Johnson recognized current concern over the cost ofcertificates as compared to cash, but said that critics need tolook more closely at the savings caused by certs, noting forexample that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Rollmarketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs.    Certificates are also an important part of any exportpromotion program, he said.    "The more you look at ways to expand export markets, themore you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more graininto the market to meet demand," he said.    Subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman (D-Kans.) said hiscommittee would be looking at the certificate program laterthis year and studying the General Accounting Office report oncertificate costs.

U.S. MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE-BOSCHWITZ A marketing loan for U.S. wheat,feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplusproduction situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. RudyBoschwitz (R-Minn.) said.    "I think I would not support a marketing loan now," he toldthe House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans andfeedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of amarketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focusedsupport on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.    A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage moreproduction, especially in high-yielding areas, would be muchmore expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loansand not increase exports significantly, he said.

USSR HEAVY BUYERS OF YUGOSLAV CORN-U.S. REPORT The Soviet Union has been a heavybuyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a reportfrom the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade.    Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have alreadybeen committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of thissold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Associationreported to the U.S. official.    In a report dated March 10, the official said that about800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balanceof 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June.    An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped fromJuly-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslavcorn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said.    Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslavcorn exports are due to the increased use of river barges forexporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said.    Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averagedaround 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlierestimates of 150,000, the official said.    The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslavcorn sales during this marketing year, he said. Reuter
NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING A greater than anticipated need,competitive prices and political motivations could be sparkingSoviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officialssaid.    As rumors circulated through grain markets today that theSoviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S.corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factorsthat make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely.    First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources saidrecent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain cropbe revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mlnannounced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.    A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affectSoviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said.    Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to theUSSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower itsArgentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mlntonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were alsocut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.    Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of thisyear's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mlntonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR.    "Significant downside potential" still exists for theArgentine crop, the official said, which will decrease theamount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.    "If the Soviet needs are greater than we have beenthinking, then they might need more than what Argentina canprovide during the April to June period," he said.    Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparkedSoviet buying.    U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world marketearlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine cornfor 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Sovietsources said.    "This price difference makes American corn competitive,"Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union,told Reuters.    Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely causethose prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. cornfutures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices havebottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.    Finally, some industry sources said that by buying theminimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grainsagreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping toconvince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat.    In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretaryRichard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheatsubsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out. Reuter
USDA REPORTS 10.572 MLN ACRES IN CONSERVATION The U.S. Agriculture Department hasaccepted 10,572,402 more acres of highly erodable cropland intothe Conservation Reserve Program, USDA announced.    In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submittedbids on a total of 11,254,837 acres.    The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre.    Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will beineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted withpermanent vegetative cover.    Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage inthe conservation program to take advantage of a corn "bonus"rental payment that was offered by USDA.    The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comoditycertificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCSprogram payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn basedaccepted into the reserve.    The state showing the biggest enrollment in theconservation program during this signup was Texas withapproximately 1.225 mln acres, followed by Iowa with 1.030 mlnacres, Minnesota with 890,000 acres, Montana 875,000 acres, andKansas with 842,000 acres.

U.S. CONSERVATION FIGURES SEEN NEUTRAL/BEARISH U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the ConservationReserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutralto bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdownwould be needed to assess the full price impact.    "Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted incorn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what thetrade was looking for," Dale Gustafson of Drexel BurnhamLambert said.    The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres intothe conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837acres.    Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate ofplanted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, butsome other analysts said they would adjust their estimatesslightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentionsfigures March 31.    Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation programrecently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreageto 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.    Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities,said there was not enough information to completely assess theconservation figures. "The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainlydisappointing," he added.    The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of theenrollment figures.    Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative forboth new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean anupward adjustment in planting intention figures.    Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificatesonto the market this spring, he said: "The trade was definitelylooking higher, so certificates are going to be less thanexpected."    The USDA offered a special corn "bonus" rental payment tothe farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonusamounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm programpayment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into thereserve.    Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, saidthe conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she hadexpected, although she noted that some trade expectations wereconsiderably higher than the actual figures.    "I think it is friendly for the market, at least in thelong run," she said.    Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was someconfusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figurebetween 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up orthe latest addition.    "It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bidinto the program," she said.    Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideasabout corn planting figures as a result of the conservationsign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in thehigh 60's.    Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slightreduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate toaround 64 mln acres.    New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmedearlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program,despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally pooryielding and not likely to make a substantial difference tofinal production figures.

AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92 A 0/92 program would have verylittle impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle onlyan additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, accordingto a report from the Agriculture Department.    The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acresidled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mlndlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.    The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.    "The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause verylarge acreages to be removed from crop production is quitesmall," the report said.    "The returns on typical farms still favor participation inthe usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permittedacreage," the USDA report said.    The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to foregoplanting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,would be most used by producers in high production/high riskareas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,director of USDA's economics analysis staff.    "In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that muchparticipation," Collins said.    USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheatwould be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.    Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushelsof sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales ofcotton, the report said.    "In determining whether to participate, a producer wouldneed to weigh the expected cash costs of production against theloan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above theexpected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must beconsidered," according to the analysis.    "What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference betweenthe loan rate and the cost of production," Collins said.    For producers with low production costs, that difference isgreater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go alongwith 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be moreattractive.    Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would bemore incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.    "I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal atfirst, but it is a step towards the goal of separatingproduction decisions from government payments," Collins said.    In a speech earlier today before the National Grains andFeed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is toolate to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup willbe over by the end of this month.

CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987 China's grain imports will risein 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, butwill be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials andJapanese traders told Reuters.    They said foreign exchange constraints and national policywould not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peakedat 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982.    An agricultural official of the Shanghai government putmaximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985.    Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poorharvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports,which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985.    "China is short of foreign exchange," the Shanghai officialsaid. "We cannot rely on imports, even at current low worldprices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become amajor importer."    A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain importswould rise and exports fall this year because of the drought,low world prices and rising domestic demand for human andanimal consumption.    "At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grainit exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badlyneeds," the trader said.    The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought isaffecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reducethe summer grain harvest from last year's level.    The paper added that leaders in some areas were not payingenough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making itdifficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mlntonnes against 391 mln in 1986.    "All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvestarea, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice andhigh-yield cash crops," it said.    It added factory production might have to be reduced toprovide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fightthe drought.    Since January, the press has devoted much attention tograin, stressing that growth in output is vital to China'seconomic and political stability and that prices paid tofarmers are too low.    Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grainproduction is a key state policy and outlined the measuresbeing taken in their areas to encourage output.    The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct ofthe pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidiseagriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also setaside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the70,000 workers available to help farmers.    Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outsideShanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and threeyears unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits.    Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department ofZhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grainoutput in his province.    "In addition, we are setting up grain production bases,raising the level of science and technology on the farms andimproving the supply of raw materials, roads and otherinfrastructure," he said.    The Shanghai official said rural residents who work inindustry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in theirspare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases,they lease the land to grain farmers.    The China Daily said last month that grain output shouldreach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be madeprofitable.    "The advantages the state promises grain growers actuallyyield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off byintermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption.Only this will boost enthusiasm," it said.

ZIMBABWE MAIZE OUTPUT TO FALL 65 PCT Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe'sstate-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65pct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agriculturalindustry sources said.    They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline toaround 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year. About 60pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercialfarmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers.    Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveriessince 1980, the sources said there is no danger of a foodshortage in Zimbabwe.    While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000tonnes, the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes,which means that even with the sharply reduced production thisyear Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years.    The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybeandeliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.

KANSAS LEGISLATOR TO OFFER U.S. 0/92 BILL TODAY U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.,chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat,soybeans and feedgrains, said he would today introduce a billto apply the so-called 0/92 concept to wheat and feedgrainsproducers.    Glickman told Reuters the measure would allow 1987 winterwheat producers and 1988 feedgrains producers the possibilityof receiving no less than 92 pct of their income supportpayments regardless of how much acreage they planted.    He also said his bill would protect program participantsfrom reduced income payments in the event market prices roseabove the loan rate. Reuter
U.S. HOUSE TARGETING PROPOSAL SPARKS INTEREST A proposal by two U.S. HouseDemocrats to target government farm benefits to small- andmedium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on aHouse subcommittee today.    "On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen," saidRep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House AgricultureSubcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. "This is thefirst hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternativeto the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal."    The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and ByronDorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrsper bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receivedeficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but notmore than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.    The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons notactively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.    Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over fiveyears, protect family farms and eliminate governmentaccumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would behalted.    However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who afamily farmer is."    Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict programpayments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.    Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the billwould determine if a person was actively engaged in farming andtherefore eligible for payments. Reuter

CHINA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA Light, scattered showers coveredwinter wheat areas in the North China Plain in the week endedMarch 14, moistening topsoils for wheat, just breaking dormancyin most central and northern areas, the Joint AgriculturalWeather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and CommerceDepartments said.    In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agencysaid southern winter wheat areas are in the early vegetativestage. Above-normal February temperatures over the North ChinaPlain caused winter grains to break dormancy early in thesouth.     Moderate to heavy rains in southern Jiangsu, Anhui,eastern Hebei, Hunan , Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zheziang, reversedFebruary's below normal precipitation pattern.    The agency said the wet weather in these areas providedample moisture for rice planting and lessened the need forirrigation.     Mostly dry weather in early-rice areas of Guanxi andGuandong resulted in irrigation for continued rice planting, itsaid. Reuter
LYNG TO MEET WITH EXPORTERS, EEP LIKELY TOPIC Secretary of Agriculture RichardLyng will meet with representatives from major grain exportingcompanies today, and the subject of subsidized wheat to theSoviet Union will likely be discussed, an aide to Lyng said.

WORLD CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA Dry weather covered most Europeancrop areas in the week ended March 14, except for those insouthwestern France, southern Italy, and Greece, the JointAgricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture andCommerce Departments said.    In its International Weather and Crop sumary, the agencysaid mixed rain and snow covered Greece.    Winter grains in England, France, and northern Italyremained dormant. Grains usuaually break dormancy in March.    Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy inearly April, it said.    Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areasof northern Pakistan and northern India, it said.    Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in centralIndia and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas bylate April.    Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India,reversing February's below-normal trend.    Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in mostsouthern areas, it said.    In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to thecentral islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzonand southern Mindanao.    Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia asrainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands.    In February locally heavy showers may have caused floodingin Java, it said.    The second cnsecutive week of dry weather stressed Moroccanwinter grains, approaching teh heading stage, the agency said.    Light to moderate rain spread from northern Thailand toNorthern Vietnam as dry weather prevailed elsewhere inSoutheast Asia.    Dry weather covered winter grain areas in western andcentral Algeria, but soil moisture was likely adequate to meetcrop demands, it said.    Light showers in eastern Algeria and Tunisia maintainedadequate moisture for crop growth, it said.    Timely rains will be needed in the next several weeks aswinter grains advance through the critical reproductive phase,the agency said. Reuter
U.S. HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0/92 DISASTER PROGRAM The House of Representativesapproved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrainsfarmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive atleast 92 pct of their federal income support payments even ifthey did not plant.    The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmersin Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passedby a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.    Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S.Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.    USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buyingcrop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposedbroad-scale revision of farm programs.    The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented fromplanting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of thedeficiency payments they would have received.    To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant adifferent crop on that land this spring, although they coulduse the land for grazing or to plant hay.    USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs,largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.    The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producersalong the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were preventedfrom planting crops this year because of residual damage fromlast fall's flooding.    In addition, the measure would require USDA to make fullpayment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approvedby Congress last fall.    Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrsin appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in theregion 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.    The administration said it opposed the bill because, byexpanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwartefforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as analternative to federal disaster assistance.    USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill werenarrower than the administration's proposal to offer the optionto all major commodities and would produce insignificantsavings.    USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmerswould produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while therequirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers wouldcost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated byCongress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mlndlrs.    USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mlndlrs.    In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.    But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option towheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceilingon the disaster assistance program. Reuter

CONGRESSMAN URGES WHEAT EEP TO SOVIET UNION Kansas Republican Congressman PatRoberts urged the Reagan administration to offer exportenhancement program, eep, subsidies to the Soviet Union.    Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee,Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, andshould also include the Soviet Union.    Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issueof an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reaganadministration recently because Secretary of State GeorgeShultz was out of the country.    "That very well may be the case," said Tom Kay, U.S.Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Serviceadministrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his replyto Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge.    Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of theUSDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow.    "I'd be delighted to deliver the message," Kay replied.

"He (Lyng) simply told us he was not in any position to talkabout an EEP (export enhancement program) initiative to theSoviet Union," said Glen Hofer, vice president of the NationalCouncil of Farmer Cooperatives.    Another participant in the meeting, who asked not to beidentified, said Lyng was "unresponsive" to the group's request.    Participants in the meeting included Cargill Inc,Continental Grain Co, Louis Dreyfus Corp, Union EquityCooperative Exchange, the National Association of WheatGrowers, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, amongothers, participants said.    Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers and UnderSecretary Daniel Amstutz also attended the 30-minute meeting.    Hofer described Lyng as "sympathetic but noncommittal," andsaid he thought he detected "a sense of frustration" on Lyng'spart at not being able to respond more positively to thegroup's urging.    A grain industry representative said some participants were"puzzled" by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before thecabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.    "There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to theidea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been,"this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referringto an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.    This official said there was not a significant amount ofpressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEPoffer to Moscow.    Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman PatrickLeahy (D-Vt.) had written two letters to Lyng urging such anoffer, this official said Lyng had received virtually no phonecalls from lawmakers on the subject.

U.S. CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING Recent purchases of U.S. corn by theSoviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasingthe price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulfexport point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said.    Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce thecash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which adealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider thannormal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by makingit worthwhile for farmers to move grain.    By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDAcould encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales,where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under thegovernment price support loan program and then marketed.    If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movementwould break the Gulf corn basis.    "The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine countyposted prices," one dealer said. "It should be taking theaverage of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City," whichwould more closely reflect the lower prices in the interiorMidwest.    "But we don't know when they might do it," an Ohio dealersaid, which has created uncertainty in the market.    The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effortto free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited tothe government and remain off the market and in storage.    Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightlymore than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificatesit has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to datebeen exchanged for grain.    With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIKcertificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, theUSDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grainby adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.    A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise inbarge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwestto the export terminals, cash dealers said.    Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risennearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of theoriginal tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening ofthe mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged thefirmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.    The higher transportation costs have served to depressinterior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained bythe elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well asdiscouraging farmer marketings, they said.    "The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,"which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as muchas 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain tradersaid.    But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside,freight rates will settle back down because of the overallsurplus of barges on the Midwest river system. Reuter

HOUSE FARM LEADER SEES BILLION DLR BUDGET CUTS The 1988 agriculture budget willhave to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, thechairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.    Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of theuse of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms arepossibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending,said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculturesubcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.    Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain andFeed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from theHouse budget committee that the agriculture committee will haveto reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billiondlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.    Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to bemade very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988budget, Glickman added.    Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.    "The administration's target price proposals are dead inthe water," he said.    To cut the budget, Glickman said, "everthing is on thetable," except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.    Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committeewill study in order to cut farm spending.    Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which hesaid would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.    Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or "pik')certificates will also be another option his committee willstudy, Glickman said.    While not committing himself for or against such action, hesaid lawmakers have to examine recent government findings whichindicate certificates cost more than cash payments.    Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms andtightening up of the person definition for annual paymentlimitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.    He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements byfive pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a movethat could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he wouldnot be in favor of such a change.    Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's,EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly beingused up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expandthis program while making cuts in other areas.    Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.    "I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the choppingblock," Glickman said. Reuter

Miller noted Secretary Schultz is scheduled to meet nextmonth with representatives of the Soviet Union, and the NAWG"wanted to be certain the secretary was aware of our concernsregarding the reopening of wheat trade with the Soviet Union."    The annual spring NAWG board of directors meeting is heldin Washington to allow grower-leaders from around the countryto meet with their state congressional delegations and membersof the executive branch.    The purpose is to discuss the current situation forproducing and marketing wheat and help set the legislative andregulatory agenda for the coming year, the NAWG statement said. Reuter

SHULTZ SAYS U.S. PRODUCTS MUST BE COMPETITIVE Asked what the U.S. StateDepartment's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow,Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leadersthat U.S. products must be competitive in the world market.    "If we are going to sell our products, whatever they maybe, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market,"Shultz told the board of directors for the National Associationof Wheat Growers.    "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say thatsomebody is going to buy your product if they can get the samething at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't," hesaid.    "That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets,and it must be our approach as we look at the American farmprogram and try to figure out what we should do to make itbetter," Shultz told the Wheat Growers.    Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation thatwould allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than theAmerican housewife, he realizes the importance of Americanagricultural products being competitively priced.    Speculation has been in the market for some time that theUnited States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Unionat subsidized prices.    Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if itwere competitively priced. Agriculture Department officialshave declined to take any official position on the issue. Reuter
ARGENTINE MAIZE, SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL Argentine grain growers reducedtheir estimates for maize and soybean production in the currentharvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.    Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reachbetween 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnesestimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated inmid-February.    But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, accordingto official figures, and would be a new record.    The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was arecord 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pctcompared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.    The change in yield estimates is due to very hightemperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year inthe soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe andnorthern Buenos Aires province.    The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybeanpods empty, especially in Cordoba.    Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, sincerainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.    Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak inBuenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. Therewas no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields wereable to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recentweeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,sunflower and sorghum harvesting.    Crops were considered in generally good condition, thoughit is still too early to judge whether the intense rains ofrecent weeks caused any long-term damage.    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of thetotal area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.    Total production for the current maize harvest is expectedto reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mlntonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pctlower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,according to official figures.    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct oftotal planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was twoto 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.    The current harvest's volume was again expected to bebetween 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower thanlast harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers fearedthat heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll oncrops and, consequently, on total production volume.    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct oftotal planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mlnhectares planted in the previous harvest.    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvestremained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mlntonnes. Reuter

AMSTUTZ SEES MORE BULLISH WHEAT OUTLOOK IN 1987 U.S. Agriculture UndersecretaryDaniel Amstutz indicated the world wheat supply/demandsituation has become more bullish recently because ofdevelopments in the world market and increased consumption.    Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriationssubcommittee, Amstutz cited three factors which have improvedthe wheat outlook.    He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about20 mln tonnes this year, primarily for feed use. There are alsoreports from Australia, Canada and Argentina that plantingshave been reduced, he said. Furthermore, he cited reports ofgreater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union.

OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED The results of a controversial studyof farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has thehighest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairyfarmers benefit more than any other commodity producers fromsubsidies.    Results of the study, which has not been released by OECDbecause of objections from some countries, were provided toReuters by officials of several countries on condition they notbe identified.    The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies forthe years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producersubsidy equivalent, PSE.    The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE, or theamount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the European Community at 68.8 pctand the United States 48.2 pct.    For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 andthe U.S. 17.2. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.    In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pctcompared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.Japan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the ECand 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.    For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in theEC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.    The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrialcountries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in mostcases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC andJapan, the sources said.    Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developingcountry producers of commodities, were not included in the OECDwork.    Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries torelease the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECDministerial meeting in Paris during May.    Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global tradetalks now underway in Geneva.    British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visitto Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a startingpoint for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.    He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiatedown domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause ofthe present crisis in world agriculture.    However, the OECD study results are controversial becausethey highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officialsfamiliar with the study said.    The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Servicerecently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt toverify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.    In some cases the results were substantially different thanthe OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. andelsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD baseperiod of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.    For example, the USDA study found the United Statessubsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.    French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, toldreporters last week that the United States subsidizes itsfarmers more than the EC.    However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probablyhigher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.    Officials of several countries have been asked tocontribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of thecurrent world farm situation.    The updated calculations, which may take several months tocomplete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictiveimport quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.    U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farmbill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments tograin farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officialsadded. Reuter
SOVIET TIMECHARTERING BOOSTS GRAIN FREIGHT RATES Current interest by Soviet charterers intaking Panamax vessels on timecharter, mainly from the U.S. Tocarry grain, is seen as the chief factor behind the recentsurge in values on the Baltic International Freight FuturesExchange (BIFFEX), dealers said.    Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today forthe first time in the spot position since the market opened inMay 1985. However, the market tends to be nervous, with valuessome 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index, which iscalculated on spot physical rates.    No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings butthey have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which wouldnormally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said.    "It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effecton its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported," one said.    Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route havesubsequently been the main beneficiary of current charteringconditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left forthe remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risensteadily for vessels loading next month.    Dealers said there is even talk that owners are consideringtaking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand.    Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chineseoperators may be in the market for similar timecharter businesslater in the year, they said.    They anticipate this would appear around June and it hasprompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite itnormally being a slack time in the shipping year.    Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Ratesturned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which hadsupported the market at the start of the year, faltered butthen recovered on the reported Soviet interest. Reuter
USDA ASKS TIGHT INSECT RULES FOR GRAIN SHIPMENTS The U.S. Agriculture Department isproposing tighter federal standards setting allowable limits oninsect infestations in grain shipments.    The changes in the standards would include the following:    -- Establishing equal tolerances for the number of liveinsects in shipments of food grains, feed grains and oilseeds.    -- Revising the definition of "infested" to give equal valueto all insects injurious to grain.    -- Establishing lower levels of infestations. In 1988, theinfested level would be set at three or more live insects perrepresentative sample (about 100 grams), in 1990 two or moreinsects, and in 1992 the final infestattion level would be setat one or more live insects per representative sample.    -- Revising the definition of sample grade by adding alimit of 10 live or dead insects per sample.    -- Revising the definition of sample grade for wheat byadding a limit of 32 insect-damaged kernels per 100 grams ofwheat.    The department asked for public comments on the proposalsby April 17. Reuter

EC TO ABOLISH TAX ON SPANISH MAIZE EXPORTS The European Community Commission hasdecided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonneimposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said.    They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC andnon-EC countries alike, would no longer be required on exportsfrom Spanish ports south of Valencia.    The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority'scereals management committee today.    The tax had been introduced last September at the same timeas a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exportsof maize to Spain from other EC member countries.    The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported intoSpain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies frombeing reexported back to them.    The sources added that Spain had received no answer fromthe committee to its request that tenders be opened for thesale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize.    The request will be considered at the committee's nextmeeting, the commission sources said.    Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes ofmaize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-ECproducer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.

U.S. EXPORTERS REPORT 350,000 TONNES CORN  SWITCHED FROM UNKNOWN TO USSR FOR American Express Co's plan to sell astake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be aprelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,analysts said.    American Express earlier said it has a generalunderstanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.    The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,as investors speculated on the possibility of more investmentin the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.    The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response tothe relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents aprice of 2.7 times book value.    Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insidertrading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8times book value.    American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. Forthe last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors ofa spinoff of part of Shearson.    Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit willbenefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasinglyimportant Tokyo financial markets.    "I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step," saidLong.    "What you will see probably in the future is AmericanExpress selling an additional 17 pct in the public market andhave a public vehicle for Shearson," Long said.    "Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitmentinto an illiquid situation," he said of Nippon.    Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake inShearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, likeother investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.    American express has said the total employees of shearsonwill expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, thatnumber is substantially lower than growth last year, a companyspokesman said.    American Express officials would not comment beyond astatement made this morning. That statement, however, did notclose off the possibility of a public offering or other optionfor Shearson.    David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possibleShearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believesthe firm will digest the Nippon investment first.    "I think they'll figure out what they're going to do withthe money they have," he said.    Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also saidAmerican Express could determine to sell shares to the public.    In its statement, the financial services giant said it iscontinuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition tothe investment by Nippon.    American Express said options under study range fromexpanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competitionto broadening its access to capital.    American Express also said the options reflect thecontinuing integral role of Shearson in American Express'worldwide financial services strategy.    Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding aJapanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake toSumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.    Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.    "Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. Theydon't have the money. There's just not enough internal capitalgrowth," said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows otherU.S. brokerage companies.    Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, areinterested in the expertise of American brokers. "Those(Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies havethe capital needs and the growth opportunities to use themoney. That's a nice marriage," he said.

SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS Secretary of State George Shultz hasdecided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to theSoviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sellsubsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and theAgriculture Department, a State Department official said.    "Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidylast summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's nowbasically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to whatthey want to do," the official said.    If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to theSoviet Union, he said, "Shultz will not wage a vigorouscampaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, buthe won't go to the President and voice his objections."    In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarksyesterday to leaders of the National Association of WheatGrowers, the State Department said, "Secretary Shultz expressedhis belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should becompetitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.    The Agriculture Department is in the best position todetermine whether consideration should be given at this time toextending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export EnhancementProgram."    Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to theSoviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer toMoscow, the State Department official said.    "Everyone in the government agrees that if there is asubsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had afirm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy."    USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when theUSSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidizedwheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.    The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the groundsthat the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bringU.S. prices down to competitive levels.    The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, theState Department source said.    "What the Soviets want is something equivalent to thelowest price being paid by anyone in the world," he said.    The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of theU.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.    Government and commodity sources also said there areelements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary DanielAmstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.    "Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not aforegone conclusion," the State Department official said. Reuter
ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS Three geographically diverse droughtsin Asia are being linked by some scientists to areintensification of the complex and little-understood El Ninoweather pattern, <Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weatherforecasting service, said.    Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcanegrowers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all faceserious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrivein time to break the droughts, offical reports, governmentofficials and meteorologists said.    Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, saidthe drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinceshave been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.    Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.    Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuanwas 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure forover 20 years, the paper said.    The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pctcompared with last March and lowered the water levels of manyrivers, it added.    This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causingshortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of theYangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing manyships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.    Unusually high temperatures have also been reported acrossChina, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan hasrecorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than averagesince early February.    The New China News Agency said the average Decembertemperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higherthan last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.    Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lankaand threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry ofPlantation Industries officials told Reuters    In Australia, concern is growing about below-averagerainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along theQueensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, localMeteorological Bureau officials said.    For many farmers and government officials the fear is thatwhile the present low rainfall does not yet pose a majorthreat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when thewheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.    Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 droughtwhich devastated the wheat crop and coincided with theoccurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known asEl Nino, they said.    Although meteorologists are cautious about linking theAsia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any singlecause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.    Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data foragriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event'was unique.    The El Nino does not always produce the same effects andthe present occurrence is much less pronounced than the lastmajor event in 1982/83, it said.    El Nino, Spanish for "Christ Child" because it appears aroundChristmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing cloudsand rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coastof Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated withthe Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the tradewinds, meteorologists said.    The winds, strengthened by El Nino's "pump" effect, raise thesea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.    When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sendsa surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where itcollides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.    One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect therain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into thePacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.    The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weathersaid.    China, where the affected areas have received between 40and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for theMay-September rains, it said.    The May-September rains normally provide thedrought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.    In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip havereceived less than half the normal rainfall during the currentwet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishingas the rainy season draws to an end.    In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should beat its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usuallyoccur between April and June, although it is not possible atthis stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual. REUTER

USDA NOT PLANNING ANY MAJOR PRICING CHANGES The Agriculture Department is notconsidering any major changes in its pricing system for postedcounty prices, an Agriculture Department offical said.    "We do not have current plans to make any major adjustmentsor changes in our pricing," said Bob Sindt, USDA assistantdeputy administrator for commodity operations.    U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this weekUSDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium atthe Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS postedprices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement.    But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes.    "If people are suggesting that we are going to makewholesale changes in pricing, we are not considering this," hesaid.    Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity ofimplementing more minor changes in its pricing system.    "We are continually monitoring the whole nationwidestructure to maintain its accuracy," he said. "If we becomeconvinced that we need to make a change, then appropriateadjustments will be made."    Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA'sprice differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interiormarkets are not accurate because of higher than normal bargefreight rates.    He said commodity operations deputy administrator RalphKlopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour andwill meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week.    Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at thatmeeting, including the current concern over the gulf cornpremiums.    He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these pricemargins reflect an average of prices throughout the year andthat seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase ordecrease.    The USDA official also said that only those counties thatuse the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by thehigh barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices.    When asked if the USDA emergency storage program whichallows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge spaceand accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discountedthe idea.    He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges andthat, under provisions of the program, these all have to beemptied by the end of March. Reuter
CONCERN OVER "EL NINO" IN PERU - USDA REPORT There are heightened fears that "ElNino" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continentsand caused widespread damage through floods and drought, theU.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Lima said in a fieldreport.    Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area,flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led toincreased concern, the report, dated March 17, said.    However, it said official sources still believe that thisyear's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.    EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds andwaters in the pacific.    The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now beingexperienced has not had an overall negative impact onagricultural production.    Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduceyields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in thecrop cycle.    Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive whereexcessive moisture exists, it said.    However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supplyof irrigation water in the major dams which will improveprospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, andslow the decline in sugar production, it said.    If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru's fishing industry couldreceive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fishcatch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said.    Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are threeto four degrees centigrade above normal but still not highenough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said.    It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino willintensify and carry on through late March, April and Maycausing problems as crops approach harvest.    "There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino-- only time will tell," the report said. Reuter
ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER The Soviet Union's winter graincrop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry plantingconditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst ofworld weather and crop conditions said.    Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of theEF Hutton publication "Global Crop News," said in her latestreport that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat,from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.    "Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Sovietwinter grain crop) is far more pessimistic," she said. "Butit's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lotwill depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of thetroubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting."    Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probablyprevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheatgrowing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasusreceived on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.    The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke recordlows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken itstoll on Soviet winter crops, she said.    However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt hadample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majorityof crop areas from severe frost damage.    The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grainsin the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily fromCanada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,Martell said.    She cited a number of reasons besides possible cropproblems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.    Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing onmoisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weathernecessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.    Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobylaccident may have contaminated more grain than originallythought and have to be made up with imports.    However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of lastresort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have onlyjust recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.    Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to theUSSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.    In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grainimports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Unionbought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only24 pct of that total.    While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised theirestimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said. Reuter

U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA The U.S. Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal todrastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growersfor the cut with targeted income payments.    In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanyingthe "Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987", Peter Myers,Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administrationwants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginningwith the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.    Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by thegovernment for the price support cut with targeted incomepayments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments wouldcost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.    The administration sugar proposal is expected to beintroduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.John Porter, R-Ill.    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic itis unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate becausepolitically-influential sugar and corn growersand high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and graduallylowers payments over four years. It also excludes from paymentany output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a growerwould receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.    The income payments would be based on the amount ofcommercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changesin the sugar program because the current high price support iscausing adverse trends in the sugar industry.    He said the current program has artificially stimulateddomestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowedcorn sweeteners to make market inroads.    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a"progressive contraction" of the sugar import quota to only onemln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugarrefiners who rely on imported sugar processing.    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program givesoverseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products acompetitive advantage. The result has been higher imports ofsugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processingfacilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost onU.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA saidconsumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more thannecessary for sugar.    "Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap betweensweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverseimpacts and trends which the sugar industry is currentlyfacing," Myers said.    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts perlb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tonsrecoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal tocompensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

STRIKE THREAT, LOWER TRAFFIC MAR SEAWAY OPENING The St. Lawrence Seaway, setto reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough yearbecause of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of thefirst strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officialssaid.    Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modesof transportation are all expected to result in only a marginalincrease over last year's traffic levels -- and revenues -- onthe 2,300 mile waterway, officials said.    In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, theseaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montrealand Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal,linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.    By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveledthrough the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln throughthe eight-lock canal.    The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrsthis year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executivemember of Canada's St Lawrence Seaway Authority.    The seaway moves about one-half of Canada's exported grain.Those exports of the single most important commodity carried onthe waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.    The Seafarers' International Union, which represents about2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has saidit will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers'demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.    "It's 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike," RomanGralewicz, head of the Seafarers' Canadian branch, has said.    The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliatorto try to hammer out a contract agreement between the twosides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships onthe Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.    "We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...aprolonged strike would have a disasterous effect," SeawayAuthority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.    "These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of theSt Lawrence Seaway," George Miller, vice-president of theCanadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of majorCanadian shipping companies, said recently.    The workers' current contract expires May 31. Theassociation said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wagesfor the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power torestructure crew dispatching.    The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs(U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic andfreight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985was its worst year in two decades.    Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls onthe Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to lastyear's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tollsthroughout the rest of the waterway.    Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks andabout 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.    "We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but wewon't see a major increase for a number of years," Hemsley said.    A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippersin Western Europe should result in some increased traffic thisseason but the full benefits won't be felt for several years,Blair said.

TAIWAN TO BOOST FARM IMPORTS FROM U.S., EUROPE Taiwan is expected to boost agriculturalimports from the U.S. And Europe in calendar 1987 to helpbalance trade, the Council of Agriculture said.    A council official, who declined to be named, told Reutersthe imports, which will include about seven mln tonnes ofoilseeds, grains and dairy products, would be worth some fourbillion U.S. Dlrs against 3.72 billion in 1986 and 3.38 billionin 1985.    Taiwan's surplus with the U.S. Rose to 13.6 billion dlrslast year from 10.2 billion in 1985, government figures show.    Government figures also show Taiwan's surplus with Europerose to 1.53 billion dlrs last year from 543 mln in 1985.    Taiwan's imports of U.S. Farm produce last year amounted to1.41 billion dlrs against 1.52 billion in 1985.    Imports from Europe rose to 182 mln U.S. Dlrs from 148 mln,the official said.

DENG SETS LIMIT TO CHINA GRAIN IMPORTS, PAPER SAYS China's top leader Deng Xiaoping saidChina must not import more than 10 mln tonnes of grain, MingPao newspaper of Hong Kong said.    Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 mln tonnes ofgrain in 1986, up from 5.97 mln in 1985 but down from a record16.15 mln in 1982.    The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output isone of several key issues that will influence the wholedevelopment of the economy. It did not give the context of hisremarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln, up from391 mln in 1986.    The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation hasreached the point where "pigs are not fed, there is not enoughgrain and increases in output have slowed."    "We should in our overall economic planning put agriculturein its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes bythe year 2000," he said. "We must avoid the situation in recentyears of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain."    The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council hasdecided to raise the price of five grains, including corn andrice, unchanged since 1978, but it gave no details. REUTER

AUSTRALIAN WHEAT AREA TO FALL, FORECASTER SAYS Australian wheat plantings areforecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF)said in its first preliminary crop forecast.    But there was no reason to expect Australian production in1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year,the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales andQueensland suffered from poor yields last season.    Most of the fall in plantings was expected in WesternAustralia while state average yields would be assisted bygrowers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said.    The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was apoor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. Butin the eastern states the wheat area should hold up providedthat rainfall between now and June is not less than average,AWF said.    Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut backwheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since theyneeded cash flow and there were problems with alternativecrops.    "The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses andoats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise ahigh proportion of growers' income," AWF said.    AWF's state area forecasts in mln hectares, with 1986/87production in mln tonnes, are as follows (crop forecasts werenot given for the new wheat year)                   Area         Crop             1987/88  1986/87  1986/87 Queensland    0.82     0.82     0.95 N.S.W.        3.07     3.17     4.40 Victoria      1.53     1.63     3.25 S.Australia   1.45     1.64     2.30 W.Australia   3.53     4.46     5.60 REUTER

RAINS PROMISE BOUNTIFUL CROPS IN ETHIOPIA Rain over wide areas has raised theprospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffereda disastrous drought and famine two years ago.    Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's AgricultureDevelopment Department, told reporters prospects were good forattaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the presentgrowing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.    Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnesa year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the "belg"(small) rains which fall at this time of year.    The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops likemaize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affectsproduction in the main rainy season, because farmers eat theirstocks of seed.    Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regionswhich suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sowtheir crops because of the favourable rains.    The government had distributed large quantities of seed andfertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop. Reuter

PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN OPPOSED BY MINISTER Portugal's Agriculture Minister AlvaroBarreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the stategrain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals importtenders open to private traders.    Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmittedto the tenders.    Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to theEuropean Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC(Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reducedby 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.    Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon'scivil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this monththat EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done,in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.    As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize.    Barreto said, "My objective is put EPAC into the tendersbecause it has a right to take part." He added the governmentwould be studying the court order to see whether or not theruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.    Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator,whether public or private, from the tenders. Private tradershad argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in thePortuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them.    "There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,"Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission hadaccepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible.    The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation inthe public tenders was unfair competition and violated theclauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with thegradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.

U.S. FARM POLICY DEBATE COULD HIT SENATE SOON The Senate this week might take upproposed legislation that could serve as a lightning rod toexpose broad initiatives to change U.S. farm policy.    The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that wouldallow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pctof their income support payments if flooding last yearprevented, or will prevent, them from planting their 1987crops, Senate staff members told Reuters.

U.S. EXPORT INSPECTIONS, IN THOUS BUSHELS  SOYBEANS 13,417 WHEAT 12,003 COR West Germany's banking authoritiesare being drawn into the currency scandal surroundingVolkswagen AG <VOWG.F> as the repercussions and allegations inthe financial community widen, banking sources said.    The Bundesbank has seconded one of its currency experts tohelp the state prosecutor investigating the currency fraud atVolkswagen, VW, in Brunswick, a Bundesbank spokesman said.    The Federal Banking Supervisory Office in West Berlin alsois considering press allegations that several banks "parked" openpositions with VW, breaching banking regulations.    Earlier this month Volkswagen said it had incurredpotential losses of 480 mln marks in an alleged fraud involvingthe hedging of open currency positions.    The foreign exchange activities of a large non-bankcorporation would not normally attract the attention of WestGerman banking regulators.    Their strict foreign exchange rules, set up after theHerstatt banking crash in 1974, apply only to banks.    "This strict banking supervision aims to protect specialinterests -- creditors and depositors," the Bundesbank spokesmansaid, adding company shareholders were not covered.    "The Volkswagen case, in so far as it involves Volkswagen'snormal foreign exchange business, lies far outside the area ofthe Bundesbank," he said.    The Bundesbank's decision to send a currency expert toBrunswick to help investigations into activities involvingVolkswagen's foreign exchange dealing room was part of thenormal assistance rendered by one public authority to another.    The expert will count as part of the state prosecutor'sstaff and not report back to the Bundesbank, he said.    But the Bundesbank could get more closely involved inallegations that banks used VW to circumvent regulations.    Section 1a of the Banking Law requires banks at the closeof business each day to hold no more than 30 pct of theircapital and reserves in open positions.    The section was introduced after the Herstatt bank crash in1974 due to currency speculation.    The Platow Brief financial newsletter said on Friday thatabout 16 banks, mainly foreign, had been circumventing section1a by "parking" such excess open positions with VW.    This would mean that the bank concerned would sell theposition temporarily to VW, buying it back a day or so later.    However, such repurchase agreements are expressly includedin section 1a as still counting as open positions.    A spokesman for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office inWest Berlin said it was following the allegations butinvestigations were difficult because the 16 banks had not beennamed. He declined to say what steps were being taken.    But banking sources said the Supervisory Office as aninitial step had approached the Platow Brief for the identityof the banks, but this had been refused. The Platow Briefdeclined comment.    If the Supervisory Office ascertains that the bankingregulations have been infringed, it will pursue the case withthe assistance of the Bundesbank.    The Office, subordinate to the Finance Ministry, does nothave branches outside Berlin.    The independent Bundesbank however operates 203 branches inWest Germany, closely monitoring local banks.    Banks deposit statistics, including currency position data,once a month with the Bundesbank's regional administrations atfederal state level, the Landeszentralbanken (LZBs).    Currency dealers said parking excess positions withnon-banking corporates was frequent practice.    Such positions would often be sold for tomorrow/nextdelivery, with a verbal agreement to buy it back the next dayat the same rate.    A VW spokesman said it was company policy not to undertakecurrency hedging but he confirmed that arbitrage was allowed.    He declined to estimate the volume of currency arbitraging.German press reports have put it at 80 billion marks a year.    The spokesman declined to comment on how it would have beenpossible to carry out a fraud involving currency hedging giventhe company's policy not to conduct this kind of business.    VW finance director Rolf Selowsky accepted responsibilityand resigned. VW has suspended six other officials and firedits former foreign exchange chief, Burkhard "Bobby" Junger.    Management board chief Carl Hahn told a ceremony todaymarking VW's 50 millionth vehicle that personnel changes didnot mean any of those involved was guilty. REUTER
EC COMMISSION SET TO DETAIL GRAIN IMPORT PLAN The EC Commission will decide shortlyprecisely how to arrange the import of third country maize andsorghum into the EC in fulfilment of its agreement with theUnited States, Commission sources said.    Under the accord, reached following U.S. complaints aboutthe impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish ECmembership, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990.    All this produce will be imported into Spain at speciallevy levels likely to be below those applying for imports intoother EC countries.    The sources said it was possible that the Spanishintervention board would be asked to buy the produce directlythis year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.    They added that the choice for future years appears to liebetween a system of regular tenders and the setting of a dailyspecial levy applicable to Spanish imports.    There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize andsorghum from Spain to other EC countries, although such a taxcould be imposed later, the sources added. Reuter
U.K., AUSTRALIA OFFER WHEAT TO BANGLADESH Britain and Australia have offered atotal of 129,250 tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh as grants tocontain rising cereal prices and help support rural employmentprojects, officials said.    They said 79,250 tonnes of wheat promised by Britain wouldbe shipped next week and used for the government's "Food forWork" program in the villages.    Under the program, workers building roads, diggingirrigation canals and engaged in other rural developmentactivities get their daily wages in wheat instead of money.    The 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat would arrive inBangladesh next month and be sold under open-market operationsdesigned to stop price increases, the officials said.    Prices of rice and wheat have risen at least 15 pct in thepast month, market sources said. But the government expectsprices to fall after the wheat harvest next month. REUTER
PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN TO REMAIN - EC SOURCES A ban by a Portuguese court on thestate buying agency EPAC taking part in cereals import tendersopen to private traders will remain unless it is reversed inPortugal or challenged in the European Court of Justice,European Commission sources said.    They denied a statement yesterday by Portuguese AgricultureMinister Alvaro Barreto that the commission had accepted thatEPAC should be eligible, saying it had taken no view in thematter.    Under the terms of Portugal's accession to the EuropeanCommunity, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC is beingreduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in1990.    Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary rulingearlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to takepart, as it had done in the past, in tenders for theliberalised share of annual grain imports.

NO PROOF OF MORE CHERNOBYL GRAIN DAMAGE-DIPLOMATS Western agricultural attaches in Moscowsaid they had no evidence to substantiate rumours that lastApril's Chernobyl nuclear disaster had a worse effect on Sovietgrain than first reported.    Current Soviet interest in chartering ships to carry grainfrom the U.S. Helped prompt the rumours on world markets. Butthe diplomats said they had seen no reports in the state pressand heard no comments from officials to substantiate them.    The official media was initially slow in reporting theaccident but, under Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev's campaignfor openness, gradually gave more and more details.    Land around the nuclear plant was contaminated to varyingdegrees. Some is now being used to grow industrial cropsinstead of grain. REUTER
EC COLD AID FOOD SCHEME MAY BE MADE PERMANENT Emergency action to distributeEuropean Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has provedso successful that the EC executive Commission may propose apermanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said.    Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC storesbetween January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved thescheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures.    The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnesof sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, hasbeen distributed to the needy through charities.    The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure tohelp poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winterand will end on March 31.    But the spokesman said the commission will consider whetherto propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system.    The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporaryscheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units(72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr)ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers.    However, commission sources said the real cost was small ifaccount is taken of the expense of keeping food in store untilits quality and value deteriorates.    On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on ECfood surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks atJanuary 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnesof beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals. Reuter

HEAVY SIGNUP SEEN IN 1987 CORN PROGRAM - USDA With less than a week remaining toenroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, Agriculture Departmentofficials said that final signup will probably exceed lastyear's level of 85 pct.    Enrollment in USDA's basic acreage reduction program willlikely total close to 90 pct, Agricultural Stabilization andConservation Service, ASCS, officials said, with 50 to 70 pctof the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paidland diversion program.    The signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officiallyends at the close of the business day on March 30.    USDA will release its official signup report around April15, an official said.    USDA personnel in the corn belt states of Iowa, Illinois,and Indiana have been reporting heavy signup activity, an ASCSofficial told Reuters.    A surge of acitivity is expected during this final week ofsignup, the official said.    "A lot of farmers have been dragging their feet becausethey were anticipating some changes in the program, but thatdoesn't look very likely now," he said.    To enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, farmers have toset aside 20 pct of the program acreage base, and have theoption to idle an additional 15 pct under a paid land diversionprogram. Reuter

U.S. CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW U.S. corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassedacreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as oneof the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixtyyears, Agriculture Department officials said.    USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures willlikely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.    Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. cornproduction will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987corn production could drop by over one billion bushels toaround seven billion bushels.    Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grainsprogram, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservationprogram, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrainanalysts said.    "There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease incorn acreage," one said. "It's difficult for any farmer to notgo along with the program this year."    Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year butat a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.    Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, theysaid, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.    If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then thedrop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 whenfarmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.    Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. Asevere drought that summer in major producing states causedyields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2billion bushels.    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analystssaid the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billionbushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.    "This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significantreduction in production," an analyst said.    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would notincrease significantly, a specialist said.    High producing corn belt states are expected to show thegreatest acreage reductions, based upon historicalparticipation in government programs, analysts said.    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the mostin marginal producing areas of the southeast and the westerncorn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.    "Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,"he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts inhigher-producing delta areas.    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, hassteadily declined in the 1980's.    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been inthe low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. Thehighest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA haskept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mlnacres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yieldsaveraging 119.3 bushels per acre.    "We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billionbushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so," an analyst said.    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres aslong as government program provisions remain the same, analystssaid.    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required toset aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligiblefor payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15pct of their acreage.    "To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have toprovide more incentives," an analyst said. Reuter

U.S. SENATE PANEL APPROVES TRADE MISSION BILL The U.S. Senate AgricultureCommittee approved a bill that would establish farm trade andaid missions to promote the use of U.S. food aid, donation,credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers.    The bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trademissions made up of representatives of the Departments ofAgriculture and State, the Agency for InternationalDevelopment, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, marketdevelopment cooperatives and private voluntary organizations.    At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one yearafter enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S.programs, including PL480, Section 416 donations, ExportEnhancement Program, the dairy export incentive program, andexport credit guarantee programs (GSM-102, GSM-103).    The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill,offered by Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), that would haverequired the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least onemln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries.    Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750,000 tonnesof surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 fooddonation program.    The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposedincrease in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost upto 50 mln dlrs per year, Senate staff said.    The committee also dropped a provision identifying whichcountries would be the focus of the trade missions' activities.    Under the bill adopted by the committee, countries "friendlyto the United States" would be eligible to host the trademissions.    Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico,the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Nigeria, Peru,Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela,Tunisia and Morocco.    The bill also would require the Foreign AgriculturalService, FAS, to have at least 850 full-time employees duringfiscal years 1987-89. As of February 28, FAS had 790 full-timeemployees, a FAS spokesman said. Reuter
ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER Argentine grain producers againreduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April,trade sources said.    They said growers now forecast soybean production thisseason at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week'sestimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mlntonnes forecast in mid-February.    The new forecast is still higher than last season's recordtotal production.    Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecastfor the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.    Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean podsin the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Feprovinces and northern Buenos Aires.    The crop since January has been hit by high temperaturesand inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more emptypods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86record of 3.34 mln hectares.    The state of the crop continued to be good in general untillast week but intense, heavy rains since could have causeddamage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.    Where the rains were less heavy they were consideredbeneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops insouthern Buenos Aires province but are not expected toinfluence production forecasts.    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, whererainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maizeand sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week byrains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, LaPampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mlnhectares in 1985/86.    The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast atbetween 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 productionand 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of thearea sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Airesalthough at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage isimpossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days ofsunshine dries the fields.    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.    Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln tonnes.    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by therains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and startingin La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes. Reuter
COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS Congress, eager to find budgetsavings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department'sgeneric commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDAand the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over howmuch the program has cost U.S. taxpayers.    The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week thatpayment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who askednot to be identified said.    USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, sayingit did not take into account storage, handling and transportsavings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided tore-examine the costs, sources said.    The issue is an important one, because congressional budgetcommittees are known to be considering limiting the use ofcertificates as a means of cutting spending.    Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO SeniorAssociate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before theSenate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.    Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there areuncertainties in determining the cost of certificates comparedto cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.    USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 centsto store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put ingovernment storage.    It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigativearm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs thegovernment more to use certificates instead of cash in farmprice and income support programs, Reagan administrationsources said.    The GAO is expected to point out that use ofpayment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tightstorage by moving grain that otherwise might not have beensold.    The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate DirectorBrian Crowley comes as congressional budget committeesintensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federalbudget deficit -- including considering limits on the use ofPIK certificates.    The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, orcerts, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays tofarmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used torepay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities orcash.    Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billiondlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January andAugust 1987, according to USDA.    Certs can cost the government more than cash primarilybecause recipients can use the certificates to pay backgovernment loans at levels below the loan rate.    Eliminating this practice, called "PIK and roll," would savethe government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according tothe Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, accordingto a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificatescost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.    The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to beconsidering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among othersavings alternatives.    The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that theestimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to datehave cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mlndlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, oneadministration official said.    However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimatesbased in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.    The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributableto the different effect certificates can have on market pricesover the course of a crop year.    USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has foundthat between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels ofcorn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn bybetween 35 and 45 cents per bushel.    Between September and November, however, certificates hadonly a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERSstudy, obtained by Reuters. Reuter

IWC ups Soviet grain 1986/87 import estimate three mln tonnes to 29 mln -  Swiss lawyers have largely headed off anattempt to restrict banking secrecy and curb their powers toact for clients despite the new, revised code of bankingconduct agreed by the Bankers' Association this week, analystssaid.    The "laundering" of drug and "insider dealing" money andcontroversy over accounts of the ousted Philippine and HaitianPresidents have hurt the standing of Swiss banks recently andstrained international relations, particularly with the UnitedStates.    Critics said the new code fell well short of demands forreform, doing little to close a key loophole in the requirementthat banks know the identity of their customers.    The Social Democratic party, a member of the rulingfour-party coalition, which forced an unsuccesful 1984referendum to curb banking secrecy, complained the code stillfell short of the legal controls they wanted.    "It looks a slight improvement on paper, but the same trickswill still be possible in practice," Felix Meier, a senior partyofficial, told Reuters.    In contrast, Swiss lawyers are happy with the new code.    "Apart from a few nuances, we are very pleased with theagreement," said Max Oesch, a senior official of the SwissLawyers Federation, which has fought a long campaign to preventany curbs on lawyers' ability to act for their clients.    "It has shown that the 4,000 Swiss lawyers who do a good jobshould not be punished for the sake of getting at the one ortwo black sheep."    The role of lawyers has been at the centre of long runningdiscussions on the renewal of the so-called "convention ofdiligence," a voluntary code of banking conduct introduced inresponse to a major banking scandal here in 1977.    With secrecy back in the public eye due to the FerdinandMarcos case and a Swiss bank link to the recently busted "PizzaConnection" international heroin ring, officials at the BankingCommission said earlier this year they wanted a tightening ofrules on anonymity.    However, the changes in the new code, which comes intooperation in October, have been minor.    Clients will still be able to keep their identity secretfrom the banks provided their lawyer pledges that therelationship with his client "is not only of a temporary nature"and involves provision of other legal services.    The Lawyers' Association said this part of their businessis very minimal anyway. In the majority of cases, people hadperfectly legal private or commercial reasons for not wantingthe bank to know their identity, Oesch said.    The Banking Commission, despite its earlier demand for avirtual abolition of the loophole, also said it was happy withthe new code.    However, critics complain that the agreement does not gofar enough to restrict the role of lawyers and could still becircumvented by criminals.    "No other group in society is allowed to regulate itself asmuch as the banks," complained Meier of the Social Democrats. "Ihope that the Banking Commission exercises its proper controlfunction."    However, other parts of the agreement won praise.    In particular, banks will also now be required to demandthe identity anyone doing more than 100,000 Swiss francs worthof business with them, even if they do not have an account atthe bank. Until now, the threshold was 500,000 francs.    Peter Kluser, head of the National Bank's legal department,which had argued for a lower limit, said the move could helpcombat the use of banks to "launder" or hide the criminal originof money.    The new code also clarifies the legal status of a tribunalable to impose heavy fines on banks which do not respect thecode. REUTER
IWC LIFTS WORLD GRAIN OUTPUT ESTIMATE TO RECORD The International Wheat Council (IWC)lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grainproduction by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, comparedwith 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.    In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leavingunchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against arecord 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.    The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat andcoarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mlnagainst 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mlnrise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.    The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 islikely to be down from last year as low world prices andrestrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.    At least four of the five major exporters expect to see adrop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. Thereis still potential for even higher average wheat yields but theIWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.    Although it is still early to assess the coarse grainoutlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in theEuropean Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area isexpected lower but oat sowings could rise.    After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Unionplans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mlnhectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields arelikely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improvedweather and a further increase in the use of intensivecultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Sovietmaize output in 1987, the IWC said.    Any reduction in world coarse grain output would bebolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWCsaid.    It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks atendof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mlntonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.    After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mlntonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs ofanother large crop this coming season with higher outputexpected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED Efforts by governments to control wheatsurpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partialsuccess, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in itslatest monthly report.    Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducingboth price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWCsays in a survey of support prices in the five main wheatexporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.    In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for exportincome, there may be problems in reducing production.    A policy of cutting wheat production could lead tounemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could thenlead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.    The IWC outlines three courses of action open togovernments in wheat exporting countries.    They could continue to support prices in the hope that whenthe world economy improves demand for wheat will rise andsurpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.    Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat whichcould be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a longperiod.    This option may prove to be the most politicallyunattractive and would result in many producers abandoningwheat production, the report said.    The third option would be for governments to distinguishbetween the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,possibly varying support prices according to farm size oroverall production.    The IWC review covers support prices in the major exportingcountries since 1982. At some time during that period all theproducers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.    These changes did not always result in lower exportsubsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations morethan offset lower prices in the domestic currency.    For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC interventionprice for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 Europeancurrency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in whichmost export transactions are denominated, the interventionprice however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost ofsupporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequersand some governments are now searching for ways to cutexpenditure, the report says.    The proportion of world wheat output produced by the fivemajor exporters declined in the period covered by the surveyfrom 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due toincreased production in China and India.    The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this wascountered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by loweracreages.    In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 percent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch toother enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

DUTCH GRAIN LEVY TEST CASE TO START IN APRIL A large Dutch animal feed compounderwill begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a testcase on the way the EC grain co-responsibility levy is applied,a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association, HetComite, told Reuters.    Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions againstalleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and,since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases withthe Business Appeal Court in The Hague.    The basic complaint is that the levy does not take accountof currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compoundersin countries with strong currencies may have to pay more intheir own currency than is paid to them by producers in anothercountry.    Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement thatcompanies can pay the amount they receive toward the levyrather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch graincommodity board.    The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial andlegal backing to the test case in the Business AdministrationCourt in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10.    The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the companyfor the test case from among the 80 lodged "because the bill(the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of thelevy contained significant currency distortions and involvedgrain from a wide variety of origins." The name of the companyis not being made public.    The Administration Court is not expected to make a finalruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesmansaid it was very likely it would refer questions to the AppealCourt in Luxembourg, and "as a result it could easily be anothernine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved."    Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders areputting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutchgovernment to follow through on earlier statements and seek acomplete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy iscollected, the spokesman said.    Het Comite, as a member of FEFAC, the association ofEuropean animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actionsprotesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court. Reuter

FRANCE WILL FIGHT EC FARM PROPOSALS - MINISTER French Agricultural MinisterFrancois Guillaume warned that France would flatly rejectproposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugarand oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt thesemarkets.    The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the interventionperiod and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase thefinancial burden on the sugar producers will also result inlower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.    "I give you my word that France, while it will not rejecttechnical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply replyin the negative to these bad reforms," Guillaume told the annualconference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).    Community agricultural ministers are due to meet againMonday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spirallingEC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.    Relations between the government and farmers have becomestrained in France in recent months.    There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations byfarmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices andfurther cutbacks in Community milk output.    But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisationof the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a majorproducer of both crops -- won him warm applause from theFNSEA's farmers.    His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for thecomplete dismantling of the system of cross border taxesdesigned to smooth out currency differences known as MonetaryCompensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoidfurther protests by producers.    Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to goahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroadagainst the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farmsector.    "The Minister's proposals back up our determination toorganise union action in the coming weeks," he told reporters,adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on aministerial level.    Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before beingappointed farm minister last spring.    Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt thatGuillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.    There have been certain advances on cutting productioncosts, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, butthere are still areas where more could be done such as onfarmers' indebtedness, he said.    Guillaume told the conference the government will makeavailable 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producersreduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.    The government has already announced financial aid for themilk sector and it was not clear how much of the packageannounced today was new aid, Lacombe said. Reuter

USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT Corn sales of 2,806,300 tonnes inthe week ended March 19 were the highest level sincemid-November, 1979, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    The department said the USSR dominated the week's activitywith purchases of 1.4 mln tonnes (which were earlier reportedunder the daily reporting system). Other large increaes wereposted for Japan and unknown destinations, it said.    Taiwan purchased 296,300 tonnes for the 1986/87 season and170,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, it said.    Wheat sales of 317,200 tonnes for the current season and125,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were down about one-thirdfrom the preceding week and the four-week average.    Wheat sales to China of 60,000 tonnes were switched from1986/87 to the 1987/88 season, it noted.    Soybean sales of 483,100 tonnes were 11 pct above the priorweek and two-thirds above the four-week average.    Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico and Portugal were the mainbuyers, the department said.    Soybean cake and meal sales of 289,400 tonnes weretwo-thirds above the previous week and the largest of themarketing year, with Venezuela the dominant purchaser.    Sales activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of4,400 tonnes, as reductions for unknown destinations more thanoffset increases for Canada, the Dominican Republic and Panama,the department said.    Cotton sales of 57,900 running bales -- 43,800 bales forthe current year and 14,200 bales for the 1987/88 season --were off 25 pct from the previous week and 50 pct from thefour-week average.

INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP India is searching for non-communistcountertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit andconserve foreign exchange.    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering andelectronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, areall on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State TradingCorp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).    "The two state trading corporations are free to use theirbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indianexports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding thatprivate firms are excluded from countertrading.    One trade source said India has targetted countries thatdepend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreignimports.    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small partof India's total trading and are likely to account for lessthan eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in tradeduring the nine months ended December, the sources said.    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the EasternBloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps ofagricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crudeoil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,against three billion in 1985/86.    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to helpnarrow the country's large trade deficit, is stillinsignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billionin the current fiscal year.    But the push to include non-communist countries incountertrade is also due to other factors, including the slowgrowth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promotingcountertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were madediscreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannotofficially support bartering.    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron oreexports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.    "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause thatpreference will be given to parties who accept payment in kindfor goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,adding that the policy remains flexible.    "We also take into account other factors such as prices atwhich the goods and services are offered to India," the tradeofficial said.    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreigncompanies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigsand railway equipment to India that they stood a better chanceif they bought Indian goods or services in return, the tradesources said.    Illustrating the point, the official said a South Koreanfirm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mlndlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.    In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buyIndian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pctsought by New Delhi, the trade official said.    "We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,"he added.    Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreigncurrency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol tobuy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe inexchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.    But despite India's new drive, countertrade has someinherent problems, they added.    "It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement thatthe trade should always be balanced," one trade source said. "Theother problem is it is often difficult to supply or buycommodities which the other party wants."    Another added, "Barter is also restrictive. We look upon itas a temporary measure to get over the current balance ofpayments difficulty.    "This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy." REUTER

LOWER ASCS CORN PRICES TO AFFECT TEN STATES The Agriculture Department'swidening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect countyposted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states, a USDAofficial said.    All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will countieswhich use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana,Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabamaand Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of CommodityOperations Division for the USDA.    USDA last night notified the grain industry that effectiveimmediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior cornwould be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts,depending on what the differential is.    USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high postedcounty prices for corn caused by high gulf prices.    "We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for amonth, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in anynearby time," Burgess said.    Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulfdifferentials when and if Gulf prices recede. "If we're off themark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off themark if we're too low?" he said.    While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall,Burgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are beingplanned right now.    "We don't tinker.

COLD AIR A THREAT TO SOME U.S. HARD WHEAT AREAS A cold air mass working its waysouth from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard redwinter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheatspecialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.    "There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough alongso that it's probably vulnerable," Krenzler said.    Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air movingfrom the north could put temperatures in the middle 20'sfahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of alow pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall thesystem.    If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hitOklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperaturescould stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.    Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crophas advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the morevulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.

U.S. SEES MORE HARMONY IN TALKS WITH FRANCE The U.S. Expects more harmonioustalks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac'sfirst official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputesbetween the two countries begin to fade.    "The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade wardidn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperationon terrorism," one U.S. Official told Reuters.    "It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect,more harmonious than usual."    Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged todeal with a series of potentially serious disputes with theUnited States.    During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets inLibya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S.Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take acircuitous route. That angered Washington.    The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said ayear ago Washington felt the French were not taking strongenough action against terrorism. "Now they are. We're pleasedand they are pleased that we are pleased," one said.    More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grainmarkets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the EuropeanCommunity  threatened to become a trade war.    In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberateCommunity moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States waspoised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community foodimports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.    Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad,supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored amajor success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last basesin northern Chad.    A French official added: "There is also a common interest ingetting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of theworld by opening up its markets."    Although relations have improved markedly between the twocountries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is theCommunity's common agricultural policy (CAP).    To Washington, as one official put it, "CAP is the root ofall evil" in international food trade because it subsidisesfarmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below worldprices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.

JAPAN ACTIVELY BOUGHT U.S. CORN LAST WEEK - TRADE Japanese feed and starch makers activelybought U.S. Corn last week, C and F basis, for July/Septembershipment in view of bullish freight rates following activeinquiries by the Soviet Union, trade sources said.    Some said the makers were seen buying some 30 pct of theirrequirements, estimated at about three mln tonnes for thethree-month shipment period.    "Belief is growing that freight rates will not declinesharply from current high levels even in the usually sluggishsummer season because the Soviet Union's chartering is seencontinuing five to seven months from April," one source said.    The sources said Japanese trading houses were seen coveringa total of 500,000 tonnes of Chinese corn for shipment in Mayto October. But they are believed to have not yet sold most ofthe corn to end-users in anticipation of further corn pricerises in the world market.    Supply from Argentina and South Africa for July/Septemberis still uncertain. But the sources forecast supplies fromArgentina may fall to 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes from ananticipated 800,000 in calendar 1987 and from South Africa to700,000 to 800,000 tonnes from an estimated one mln in light oftighter export availability.

SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countriesfor emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by thecountry's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.    Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aidneeded for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.    The letter said the government had to step in "to avertserious economic hardship" and because the Social ServicesMinistry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provisionof 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.    The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a sixmonth period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice cropwas harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour andother cereals were required, it said, along with supplies ofsugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.    In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha(October 1986-April 1987) crop had been "almost completelydevastated," the letter said. Maha paddy output was nowestimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originallyexpected.    There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a highforecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequaterainfall within the next three to four weeks.    "Should the present drought continue, however, production isestimated at around 20 mln bushels," the letter added.    Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Lastyear's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.    The letter said villagers in most seriously affecteddistricts had been deprived of any means of subsistence becausesubsidiary crops had also failed.    It said the government's current budget did not permit itto provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected."Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodityprices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continueto exert pressure on the expenditure side."    The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees permonth for each family, as well as handling, transport anddistribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds bythe government would not be possible without seriouslyimpairing development projects, or "greatly fuelling inflation"in the economy, the letter said.    The letter said the Food Department would be able torelease wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet theimmediate cereal requirements "provided such stocks are replacedsubsequently."    The Meteorological Department said the country wasexperiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-monthdry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break whenthe monsoon rains fell in late May.    The letter said some areas had been experiencing thedrought since August, and in the rice growing district ofKurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June1986. Reuter

COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET Consuming countries, chastened by thecollapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price supportoperations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before thatcommodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they areserving, a Reuter survey showed.    They want price ranges to be more responsive to markettrends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining theaccords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoidthe risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.    Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned ageneralised approach to commodity price stabilisation andprefer to assess each commodity case by case, the surveyshowed.    The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week setprecise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could dounder the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchaselimits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures marketsand stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct oftotal buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. Thiswill help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, theworld's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.    The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the BufferStock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.    A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) wasadopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exportingcountries agreed several changes to make the reference pricemore responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisionsunder which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to financeoperations. Direct cash contributions from members will fundbuffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular featureof the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses runninginto hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.    Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiationsin London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist thatagreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.    Consumers and a small group of producers argued that"objective criteria" should be used to define export quotashares, which would have meant a reduction in the share ofBrazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintainits previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,delegates and trade sources see chances of any near termnegotiations on export quota distribution as remote.    International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. Thesedo not have any economic clauses but provide a forum fordiscussions on possible future economic agreements, collectstatistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts saiddifferences between sugar exporting countries have held up anyprogress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheercompetition between major exporters amid a world grain glutmilitate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.    An alternative focus for commodity discussions areinternational study groups, made up of governments with advicefrom industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.    The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planneddirectly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed tobecome operational because neither the U.S. Nor the SovietUnion has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said theU.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,citing the lack of widespread support.    U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials inKuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commoditypact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing tostudy individual cases for economically sound, market-orientedcommodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.    "We see little to be gained by attempting to increase theprice of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,"official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currentlybelongs to only two international commodity agreements thathave economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement(ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheatpacts.    The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreementbecause it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic andnot designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRAas the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.    U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other membersof the pact to agree that the price review and adjustmentmechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflectmarket trends and also to continue the accord as a marketoriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.    Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they haveconsistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts onthe merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries MinisterLim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, theworld's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides itsparticipation in international commodity pacts case by case.    Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin ProducingCountries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPClaunched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnesfor a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from70,000.    Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture anddelegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron toldReuters in London, "Agreements with economic clauses tostabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges wereclose to market reality, if there was full participation byproducers and consumers, and if participants were prepared totake their obligations in the framework of the agreementseriously."    But Baron added, "No real sanctions are available for acountry that doesn't stick to its obligations...The Germanapproach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the bestinstrument to help developing countries. They were never meantto be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is howdeveloping countries often interpret them."    Traditionally Britain has always been supportive ofcommodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with ThirdWorld producing countries. But recently demands for morestringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on theneed for "intellectual honesty" and "objective criteria" havegrown.    British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to bea two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.    It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving directmarket participation through a buffer stock have a high degreeof transparency and do not contain the risk of open-endedborrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices toreflect changes in market structure and price trends ratherthan dictate what prices should be.    A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges pricerealism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.    A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourableto commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer ofsugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the realmarket situation, particularly regarding stocks.    Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja toldReuters in Jakarta: "These agreements can work as long as theproblems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there arestructural problems..But we are still committed to commodityagreements as an act of faith." Nicaraguan External TradeMinister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producerscannot afford not to give their backing to commodityagreements.    "The political will is not there on the part of someconsumers to make agreements work," Martinez Cuenca said.    The head of the economics department in the BrazilianForeign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters anagreement can be successful if it keeps a link with marketreality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a systemof quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pactand actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman GrahamShanley said consuming countries realise steady export earningsenhance developing countries' ability to service debt and meangreater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.

KANSAS EXCHANGE HITS CFTC POSITION LIMIT PLAN The Kansas City Board of Trade,KCBT, has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposalto raise the Chicago Board of Trade's, CBT, speculativeposition limits on wheat futures contracts, saying the planwould put the the Kansas exchange "at a serious competitivedisadvantage."    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last monthproposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900contracts for any single month from 600 contracts.    At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheatspeculative position limits unchanged.    "Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat wouldsignificantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBTfor speculative interest," Michael Braude, president of theKansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC.    A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account openinterest affected by existing speculative limits in proposingto raise CBT's limits.

WEATHER HURTING YUGOSLAV WHEAT - USDA REPORT Unfavorable late winter weatherconditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslaviaindicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop,the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said.    The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade toSubotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crophad been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spellthat followed a period of warm weather.    He said unseasonably warm weather in late February thatbrought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early wasfollowed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.    Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of whichshow stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leafand possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.    The report said that since much of the early growth inFebruary was from late seeding rather than from normaldevelopment, his view was that the damage may be more extensivethan some local observers say.    The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fieldson normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin andchances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.    However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorableand many of the fields had already been top-dressed, whichwould aid recovery. Reuter

WINTER WEATHER HURTS EAST GERMAN GRAIN - USDA Shifts from mild to very coldweather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sownwinter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, theU.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said.    In a field report, the officer said indications were thatwinter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares comparedwith 38,000 last year.    He said the damage was probably more limited in southernand central regions and most widespread in the north.    Damage was most severe on plants above the ground wherelittle or no snow cover was present, he added.    The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshineduring the day led to some heaving, particularly for welldeveloped plants and for winter barley.    Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standingwater occurred in the fields.    The officer said repairing damage will probably call forspecial measures this spring in fields with damaged plants andwhere stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timedapplications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added. Reuter

GRAIN REPORTS IMPROVE U.S. FARM OUTLOOK-ANALYSTS The U.S. grain planting intentions andstocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, agrain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.    The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocksare "the first report we've had for a long time that shows anyoptimism for anybody," said John "Bud" Frazier, grain analystand executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.    "I'm really excited about it," Frazier said.    The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend toplant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted lastyear, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.    The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels ofsoybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushelsof wheat, all below trade guesses.    Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analystwith AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst withShearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Tradepanel to discuss the reports.    Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendlyfor the market, and soybean prices would jump three to fivecents a bushel "if the bell rang right now."    "We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn andsoybeans) than we thought we had," he said, noting that hog andpoultry production is up.    "We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,"said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and15 pct in the preceding quarter.    However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceedconsumption.    She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres camein southeastern states, where yields are usually low.    "We have the potential for record breaking soybean yieldsthis year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow'sopening," she said.    Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and thecrop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down fromlast year's 8.25 billion bushels.    "We'll need very good disappearance next year to reducestocks," she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last yearat 6.7 billion bushels.    Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the longterm, "But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks downto where we could start rebuilding prices."    Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage reportcould prompt farmers to change their plans and plant moresoybeans.    The panelists agreed that the reports should discouragetalk of revising the 1985 farm bill.    "There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm lawwe're working under today, and this report should reinforcethat," Frazier said.    "We are seeing the program beginning to work," said Meyer.

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND "If we go on using upfarmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in20 years to grow grain on."    Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village onthe edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as ittries to feed its more than one billion people and at the sametime let them get richer by building factories and new homes.    China has to feed one quarter of the world's population,but only one seventh of its land is arable.    Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China intoa net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in1986.    But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside whichhas occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land forfactories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.    Official figures show that China lost just under one pct ofits arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smalleramount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed duringthe two years.    "We lost very little land prior to 1980 when theindustrialisation began," official Xu said. "Since then, nearlyall the families in the county have built new homes and manyfactories have gone up."    "Last year we lost land to a new railway line," Xu said. Butland losses in future should fall because nearly all familiesalready have new houses, she added.    The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to thePeking leadership, which announced earlier this month thatChina will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain landfor the first time this year.    "The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious," saidan article in the official press explaining the new measures.    "It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland," itsaid. "China has a large population and its land resources arebadly deficient."    An official of the Shanghai city government said countyauthorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares ofarable land to other uses, while anything more than that mustbe approved by the city government.   The Peking government faces another major obstacle in itsefforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. Theprices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, makingit more profitable for them to grow other crops.    To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliserand diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts tobuy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices toChina's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidisegrain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.    Some officials argue that the simplest solution to theproblem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.    Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in theeastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened toomuch to the demands of "selfish city people" and could raise citygrain prices without any problem.    But the government has ruled out a price rise. "Raising theprice of grain would directly conflict with the goal of socialstability," said a China Daily editorial this month.    The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over thelong term. "We must be very careful. We have a very largepopulation which is used to price stability and will object toprice rises," he said. "The problem is how to do it."    The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices mightalso affect the prices of hundreds of food products made withgrain and consumed by city residents.    In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequateinvestment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.    The official press has reported that farmers fear farmpolicy may change and they are putting their new wealth intobuilding graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.    Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers signcontracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.    "As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost atthe halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about thefuture," the China Daily said in an editorial last month.    Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed touse the land but not own it. For most of the period ofCommunist rule, the land was organised into collectives wherethere was little room for individual initiative.    "New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistencyof government policies and make them interested in long-terminvestment," the newspaper said. REUTER
CHINA OFFICIAL CONDEMNS GOVERNMENT GRAIN POLICY The grain output of a major Chinesegrain-producing province is not increasing, because farmerslack incentives, production costs are rising, storagefacilities are poor and there is not enough state investment ingrain, the province's vice-governor said.    The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui,as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton asthey could growing grain, and three times as much growing cashcrops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pctof farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investmenthad caused the area of irrigated land to fall.    Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pctof the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.    He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain washit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and afurther 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.    He said government measures to deal with the problem dealtwith trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for moreinvestment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal useof or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called thetendency to rely on grain imports.    The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate tothe National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He saidthe government had cut agricultural investment to three to fourpct from 11 pct.    "With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past fewyears, some people got carried away, relaxing their attentionto grain and cotton production," he said.    On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to beself-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from thenortheast, but it imports wheat.    "Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reachthe 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be consideredadequate," Tian said. REUTER

SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER Speculation the United States willoffer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to havereached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary ofState George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheatmarkets since officials from the two countries held theircustomary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow'sdecision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn marketstrengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand inthe way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export EnhancementProgram, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit toMoscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representativeshere as a clear signal that the Reagan administration waspreparing an offer.    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lippedabout the prospects of a subsidy offer.    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned thecontention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,while not a "done deal," is a live possibility.    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whomasked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that anoffer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,are saying they would not rule one out.    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as topredict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten daysto two weeks.    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaderswho had been in contact with administration officials.    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancementoffer would be made by the middle of this month.    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would endup being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier thisyear when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrsper tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheatsubsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases ofU.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat dealwould appear to be price.    Last summer the administration took the controversial stepof offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but wereembarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the groundsthat the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat pricesfar above world market prices.    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level upfront instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be ameans of controlling the price while attempting to dampencriticism, grain trade sources said.    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultzfrom saying the Soviets were "chortling" because Washington wasoffering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available toU.S. housewives.    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representativeshere is that a general warming of relations between the twocountries since last summer, combined with continued hard timesin the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would considerbuying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstancessurrounding the administration's announcement of the wheatsubsidy offer last summer.    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional andindustry leaders were led to believe the White House haddecided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include notonly the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer toinclude only the Soviets.    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure ofuncertainty even to the predictions of those most convincedthat the administration will not now pass up the opportunity tosell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

U.S. SAID PROMISED BULK OF MAIZE EXPORT TO SPAIN The U.S. Has been promised a nearmonopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countriesguaranteed under an agreement with the European Community, anEC official said.    The official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters thatthe guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of theagreement.    Under the accord, which began in January, third countrieswere guaranteed access for the next four years for two mlntonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market, as well as300,000 tonnes of sorghum.    However, the official said the U.S. Had been assured thatalmost all the exports would be reserved for its traders.    The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either atender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or toauthorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board.    EC sources noted that under a tender system maize fromoutside the U.S. Would sometimes be offered on more favourableterms than that from the U.S.    No Commission spokesman was immediately available forcomment.

HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP Fresh, heavy rains caused furtherdamage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the weekto yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, tradesources said.    They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum cropswere damaged and yield estimates affected. New productionforecasts were made for all these crops.    The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registeredmore than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires andworsened the flooding in various parts of the province.    The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aireshave surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.    The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.    In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres areabordering on Uruguay.    In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mmin places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.    The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.    Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also befurther delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.    The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of thecrops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.    Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa andBuenos Aires provinces.    The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has beenlowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lowerthan the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.    The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.    The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of thearea sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Itwill begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weatherpermitting.    Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mlntonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which privateproducers put 1985/86 production.    The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the officialfigure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production.    The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers'targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.    The production forecast was reduced to between three and3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.    The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mlnhectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.    The forecast for soybean yield this season was the leastchanged in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.    These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season'srecord of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources,and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.    The adjustment to the production forecast is due to therains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced thesunlight needed for this crop, sources said.    Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted downfurther.

U.S. FARM REORGANIZATIONS PROVING COSTLY - GAO U.S. farmers who reorganize theiroperations to circumvent a cap on federal payments could add2.3 billion dlrs to the cost of the government's agriculturalprograms by 1989, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said.    "We estimate that should the trend in farm reorganizationscontinue, reorganizations since 1984 could be adding almost 900mln dlrs annually to program costs by 1989," GAO SeniorAssociate Director Brian Crowley said.    "Cumulative costs for the six-year period, 1984 to 1989,could approach 2.3 billion dlrs," he said.    Between 1984 and 1986, reorganizations added almost 9,000new persons to U.S. Agriculture Department payment rolls,Crowley told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat,Soybeans and Feedgrains.

ANALYSTS SAY USSR MAY PREFER NEW CROP U.S. WHEAT The Soviet Union would likely be moreinterested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking anygrain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S.wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said.    Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchasesuntil the condition of winter and spring crops is better knownmake new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman,director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.    "Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offereda subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respondto," Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusinesseducation conference here. But if there are too manyconstraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take lessthan an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said.    Hoffman said Pillsbury's internal statistics put SovietUnion wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidyoffer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels,Moscow would likely buy more, he said.    "If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, Iexpect they'll take it," said Vernon McMinimy, director ofcommodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.    McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact oncrops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under asubsidy offer.    Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start becauseof a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter"they probably have had more damage due to winter weather thannormal," McMinimy said.

STRONG DEMAND FOR U.S. CORN IN JAPAN -- USDA Japan appears to be relying less oncorn from China, Argentina and South Africa and more onsupplies from the United States, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment said.    In its World Production and Trade report, the departmentsaid in the past seven weeks reported U.S. corn sales of nearlythree mln tonnes to Japan are about three times the levelduring this period last year.    Reports of short Argentine supplies and the apparentunwillingness of the Chinese to sell at current world pricesmay have caused Japanese buyers to turn to the United Statesfor corn supplies, the department said.

FRENCH SUBSIDIZED CORN FOR TUNISIA/MOROCCO-USDA U.S. corn sales to Tunisia, Moroccoand other North African countries may face increasedcompetition from European Community (EC) corn sales, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In its World Production and Trade report, the USDA saidsales of French corn for nearby delivery have been confirmedwith an export subsidy of about 145 dlrs per tonne, bringingthe French price to about 72 dlrs per tonne, FOB.    While this is about the same price as U.S. corn, EC cornhas lower transport costs, the department noted.    The French sales mark the beginning of commercial EC cornexports which could reach 750,000 tonnes to North Africa andthe Middle East, areas which have traditionally purchased theircorn needs from the United States, the department said.    Department officials said the 750,000 tonnes of exports arefor the year up to September 30 1987.    They said export licenses for about 500,000 tonnes havebeen issued so far. Reuter

EC DENIES MAIZE EXPORTS RESERVED FOR U.S. The agreement between the U.S. And theEuropean Community (EC) on special imports of maize and sorghumprovides an equal chance for all non-EC countries to supply theSpanish market, an EC Commission spokeswoman said.

Under the agreement, the EC will import two mln tonnes ofmaize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year into Spain atspecially reduced levy rates for the next four years.

AWB CALLS FOR TIGHTER WHEAT QUALITY CONTROLS Australia is risking wheat exportsales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meetbuyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.    "Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly qualityconscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual qualityspecifications," the board said in a submission to the RoyalCommission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport.    "Many of the specifications are more specific than thecurrent categories used in Australia," it said.    The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costsand boosting efficiency of the grain handling system.    Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat marketshare because its competitors are supplying cheaper butlower-quality grades, the AWB submission said.    It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at everystage from receival to shipping.    Better industrial relations at grain terminals, moreuniform transport systems across the states and extensive stockcontrol were vital to improved marketing, it said.    The submission also said Australia's federal system impededthe AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing ofwheat.    The AWB called for an end to physical and legislativeconstraints at state borders that prevent the efficienttransport of grains to other states for shipment.    "It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic modeto the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state inwhich the wheat is grown or stored," it said.    For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW)might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than toSydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly,southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland orGeelong, in Victoria.    Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly overgrain shipments was one notable impediment, it said.    The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulkhandling authorities is not essential, although it said itfavoured the authorities maintaining at least their currentlevel of control of storage and transport as long as qualitywas maintained.    An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel atvarious Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houstonand 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

U.S. ACREAGE CUTS SEEN LIMITING STOCK BUILD Sharp cuts this year in U.S. plantedacreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile butwill at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, AgricultureDepartment and industry commodity analysts said.    "The scenario is turning around on stocks. The wholesupply/demand picture could finally be getting more inbalance," a USDA analyst said.    The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicatedthat U.S. farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annualacreage reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mlnacres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program,bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres,almost a third of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base.    Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 willprobably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup instocks, analysts said.    "It's a substantially different story from last year whenwe added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile," VernonMcMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said.    Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here,McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likelytranslate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields,final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels.    McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resultingin a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpileof 5.45 billion bushels.    "To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we'reat least in a holding pattern," George Hoffman, director ofcommodity analysis for Pillsbury said.    Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to "significantly less"domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices.    USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage andsaid wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least notincrease. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, nextyear's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said.    "We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now,so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreagereductions, that would be an improvement," an AgricultureDepartment wheat analyst said.    Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be thesmallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lowerfinal production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to100 mln bushels, analysts said.    As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in theconservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programswill be more effective because they will force more highproducing land out of production, a USDA analyst said.    "We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very longtunnel," the analyst said. Reuter

PIK-AND-ROLL PRESSURES CORN BASIS VALUES Changes by the USDA in its posted countyprices have successfully increased PIK-and-roll activity as away to pull corn out of government stockpiles, with theresulting jump in free supplies pressuring terminal corn basisvalues, cash grain dealers said.    Processors dropped spot Chicago corn basis bids three centsafter covering most of the April needs this week, with rivercorn basis bids following CIF Gulf corn values lower.    The surge in PIK-and-roll also pressured corn futures, withMay settling today down three cents per bushel at 1.58-1/2dlrs, near the contract low of 1.49-1/4 dlrs. But unlike in thepast when lower prices slowed country movement, now lowercounty prices widen the differentials with the corn loan andmake PIK-and-roll even more attractive, they noted. Reuter

JAPAN STUDY URGES FOREIGN ACCESS TO FARM MARKETS Japan should increase foreign access toits farm products market, while encouraging further developmentof domestic agriculture, a government report said.    The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31said active participation in writing world farm trade rules atthe next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.    Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked aneasing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports whichstressed the need for strict controls on some products tomaintain self-sufficiency in food.    Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.    The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow toimprove productivity and demand/supply imbalances.    The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainlyresponsible for higher domestic prices, it said.    The strong yen has meant lower input material prices buthas also resulted in higher agricultural imports which hasworsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the papersaid.    This could make it difficult to improve the industry'sstructure, the paper said.    To solve these problems and to reduce farm product pricesto more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure thethe agricultural sector to improve productivity and make itself-supporting, it said.

PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER Pakistan is not emerging as a majorwheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough,Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to thePakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.    No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so andplans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothingbecause they could not agree a price, he said.    Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surplusesof one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next fewharvests in years when the weather is favourable.    The government does not wish to increase output much abovethis because of low world prices, and the land would be betterused for other crops.    Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sownto wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched tomore profitable crops such as oilseeds.    The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from thecurrent 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per haover the next five to seven years, he said.    Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which isjust beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mlntonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year'syield of 14.0 mln.    He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but morerecent rains reduced prospects slightly.    The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mlntonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annualpopulation growth rate of more than three pct. Currentconsumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.    The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said.This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mlntonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a"strategic reserve" target of two mln tonnes.    Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes overtarget, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.    The government wants to keep an extra "safety margin" untilit sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheatrationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exportswill be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88crop can be gauged as well, he said.    The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for thegovernment to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at tworupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price inPakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.    Under the old system, introduced during World War Two anddue to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards wereissued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.    Aziz said following the introduction of a governmentsupport price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted thatonly 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching theconsumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.    The ration system had also not had the stabilising effecton the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.    Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction ofthe new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensivePakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.    Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have amajor effect on total consumption, but it may encourage betteruse of side-products such as bran. Reuter
EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND The European Commission's decision torelease an additional 300,000 tonnes of British interventionfeed wheat for the home market will provide only moderaterelief in an increasingly tight market, traders said.    Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage,pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender themarket sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonneswere granted.    The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely tosatisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition forsupplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.    The release of the feed wheat followed recent strongrepresentations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission.There has been growing concern that rising internal prices,triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage ininterior markets.    The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at theApril 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month.The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May andJune.    News of the release produced an early downward reaction inlocal physical markets, but by midday some sections had halvedearly two stg losses while others were unchanged.    Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mlntonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in thefree market. However, some traders believe these figures areoverstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, thebulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also offthe market in futures stores.    A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has beensold for export or to the home market since the season startedJuly 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59mln tonnes.    Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mlntonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.    This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed allearly expectations and has created the present nervoussituation in domestic markets where the fear now is free marketsupplies may not last out until new crop becomes available inAugust.    The market is sticking to its recent prediction of totalbarley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a newrecord and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnesachieved in the 1984/85 season.    Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln andbarley around 4.50 mln tonnes.    The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mlntonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traderssaid.    Other EC countries have bought large amounts of Britishgrain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mlntonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compareswith 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.    The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to staybuoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If suppliesbecome more difficult and prices strengthen further, feedcompounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said. Reuter

LOWER U.S. RICE STOCKS, STRONG EXPORTS - USDA Rising demand for U.S. rice maygradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should helpincrease the U.S. share of the world rice market despitesluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, thedepartment said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mlnhundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt onJuly 31.    Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage isexpected to decline this year, the report said.    USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grainacreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grainrelative to long grain have increased, the loan differentialhas been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yieldsrelative to those of other classes have leveled off.    With the drop in domestic prices resulting from themarketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at afaster rate, USDA said.    "Development of new products and increased promotion havehelped make rice more available and visible to a wider range ofconsumers," USDA said.    USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 becauseof large production and stocks but a weaker market shouldaffect competing exporters more than the U.S.    "The United States has already recovered a substantial shareof the European Community market and made inroads into marketsin the Middle East and Africa," the report said.    World rice consumption is projected to reach record levelsin 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes,increased domestic production and low import prices haveallowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarsegrains.    China, India and South Korea have increased output, whilethe Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since themid-1970s, the report said. Reuter

BALDRIGE SEES NO TRADE WAR WITH JAPAN U.S. Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige said the dispute between the U.S. And Japan overcomputer chips will not develop into a full-scale trade war.    "I think both sides will try and make sure that this doesn'tstart a trade war -- as a matter of fact I'm positive thatthere won't be a trade war with Japan," Baldrige said in atelevision interview.    President Reagan last week imposed penalties over Japan'salleged failure to adhere to a July 1986 agreement to stopselling semiconductors in third countries at below cost and toopen its own market to U.S.-made chips.    Despite Tokyo's displeasure with the penalties, Baldrigesaid Japan would refrain from taking retaliatory steps thatwould lead to a trade war, largely because Japan itself wouldhave the most to lose in such a conflict.    "Japan, I think will -- because they have the means to do it-- face up to the fact that as the second largest industrialtrading power in the world they have to live up to theirresponsibilities of free trade," he said.    "I think we'll work our way out of this," he added. "It's notgoing to be easy. But I guarantee you, we're not going to havea trade war." REUTER
OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF FAMINE IN BANGLADESH The failure of the Bangladesh governmentto tackle the country's current food crisis could lead to afamine, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, KhaledaZia, told a press conference yesterday.    Prices of rice rose by at least 25 pct across the countryin March and the government has begun emergency rice and wheatsales to lower cereal prices, a food ministry report said.    Ministry officials said the next harvest, due in mid-Aprilwill ease the situation. "Temporary grain shortage in the aridnorth and some other rain-starved regions is not unusual atthis time of the year," one official said.    Khaleda, said corrupt practices by food officials andfailure to procure enough grains contributed to the crisis. Herremarks coincided with newspaper reports that a continuing heatwave has destroyed thousands of acres of crops in thesouth-west.    Officials said last week Bangladesh now has only 390,000tonnes of grain in stock which would be exhausted in two orthree weeks. Bangladesh expects to produce 14.5 mln tonnes ofrice and 1.5 mln tonnes of wheat in 1986/87 ending June 30. Itrevised its food import target for this fiscal year upward by300,000 tonnes to 1.8 mln.

U.S. GRAIN CERTS SAVE 50-100 MLN DLRS - AMSTUTZ The use of generic commoditycertificates, or "certs," for fiscal years 1986-88 will savethe government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, Department of AgricultureUndersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.    Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on theuse of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 couldresult in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.    However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in netsavings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said.    Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly theentire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have beenforfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC.    In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have beenredeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges wouldhave remained in the goverment inventory, he said.    When asked to comment on a recent study by the GeneralAccounting Office that concluded certificates result in a netcost to the government, Amstutz said, "GAO underestimated thebenefits and overstated the costs" of the certificate program.    Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loanentries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions ratherthan forfeitures.    GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said.    "There is no question in the mind of the Department ofAgriculture that these certificates have been very useful,"Amstutz said.    Immediate benefits of certificates include greater marketliquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farmincome, and improved debt situation and decreased carryingcosts, he said.    Certificates are an integral part of USDA's long-rangemarket-oriented farm policy, he said.    Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman,D-Kans., that USDA is in the process of preparing an officialresponse to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it tothe subcommittee when completed. Reuter
MORE U.S. GRAIN CERTIFICATES NEEDED, STUDY SAYS More generic grain certificatesshould be released onto the market in order for the U.S.certificate program to have its full effect on commodities,according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc.    The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiencypayments and paid land diversion payments in a two-thirdcertificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told aHouse agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates.    Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughlya 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said.    The Sparks study on certificates examined two possiblescenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a "zerocertificate case," where no certificate program was assumed,and an alternative case labeled "adequate certificate case" inwhich sufficient certificates would be released so that grainprices would not be artificially supported by market shortagesdue to acreage reduction programs or government holdings.    The study showed that total grain use under the adequatecertificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenarioby 11.2 pct.    Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grainusage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed thezero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct.    For the five-year period examined, government expendituresunder the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.    The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct ofthose savings resulted from smaller government storage costs.    The study also estimated that government grain stocks underthe adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushelsbelow the zero certificate case at the end of the periodexamined.    The Sparks study said that while certificates permit marketprices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increasecommodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versuscash. Reuter

Export growth was smaller than expected due to lowerearnings from many key commodities including rice whoseearnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26pct and canned pineapples seven pct.    Products registering high export growth were jewellery up64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct. REUTER

JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S. Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market," he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table," the officialsaid. REUTER
ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE The Zambian government has no immediateplans to follow last week's increase in the producer price ofmaize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, anofficial of the ruling party said.    Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price forrefined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots inwhich at least 15 people died.    That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda laterrevoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund(IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.    However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail priceincrease, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,a practice discouraged by the IMF.    "There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels ofmeal. It (the government) would have to choose between thedemands of the IMF and those of the people," a Ministry ofAgriculture economist said.

FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, whichwill be sown between May and August or September, has so farnot been as intense as in previous years. Reuter

BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS Storage problems with Brazil's recordgrain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mlntonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of thisyear's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable inharvesting, but that most of it would stem from storageproblems.    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,theoretically sufficient for the crop.    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badlydistributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande doSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but wereresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-Westgrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storagecapacity.    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya andmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grainsproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared tostoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable forstoring loose grain, Brito said.    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport thecrops.    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crophas been evident from television reports, which have shownenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries. Reuter

SOUTH KOREA CORN IMPORTS MAY INCREASE - USDA South Korea's purchase of about 2.4mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close todouble last year's total -- indicates that imports from theUnited States, as well as total imports are set for a dramaticjump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In its World Production and Trade Report, the departmentsaid total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season(Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mlntonnes from the United States.    During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mlntonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.

FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987 The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation(FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely tofall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.    FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total worldgrain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the SovietUnion, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.    World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast torise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening theimpact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenlydistributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.    "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for manydeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, depend cruciallyon the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said.    FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated ata record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than lastseason and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.    FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revisedupwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood ofsubstantial buying by China and the Soviet Union. REUTER

BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT Based on field travel in theBrazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be aboutaverage or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.    It said generally favorable weather from early Decemberthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness.    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 daysfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the secondweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeanswhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, thereport said.    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will createserious storage problems, the report said.    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased bymore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields areexpected to be above average, it said.    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn cropcrop has been harvested.    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grainelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, thereport said.    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Paranaaccounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasonsfor the decline are expected reduced government support priceand good summer crop harvests. Reuter

SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA The U.S. Agriculture Departmentincreased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the SovietUnion to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.    In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, theUSDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated becauseSoviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the lastmonth.    USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising"because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.    All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,USDA said.    Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnesmiscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.    USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop sufferedthrough a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.    The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in aboveaverage winter-kill," USDA said.    Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter lossesmaybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buyinggrain recently.    USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnesgrain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheatand 12 mln tonnes coarse grain. Reuter

USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT  U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mlntonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the priorweek, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, thedepartment said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largestbuyers.    Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.    Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season andnet reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season werefour-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and thefour-week average, it said.    Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination withpurchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.    Other significant purchasers for the current year wereMexico and Honduras, it said.    Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below theprior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.    Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the majorpurchasers, the department said.    Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-weekaverage. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, theNetherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset byreductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.    Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, theDepartment said.    Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's levelbut nine pct below the four-week average.    Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followedby Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.

U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS Commodities from gold to grains tocotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as lossesin the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears ofinflation and economic instability.    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation thatinflation will be the only way for the major industrial nationsto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said SteveChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co., in New York.    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials fromthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed theircommitment to support its value, and despite reports ofintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, knownas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-termdirection of the currency markets.    "Maybe they have some ideas or plans," said Chronowitz. "Ifthey do, it's not evident."    "It looks like there's no cure but to let the free markettake values to where they should be.    "One way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies," as a measure to correctthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.    "I think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It'sgoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what'shappening," he said.    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bondssaw the value of their investments falling and many are turningto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said MartyMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house ofDominick and Dominick.    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughoutthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cottonposted broad gains.    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in thegrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensomesupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulateexport demand.    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Departmentraised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union bytwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on theChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderatelyhigher.    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They saidhogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal atthis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with fieldwork to market animals. Reuter

DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS A prolonged dry spell has damaged111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provincesin the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officialssaid.    They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produceestimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack ofrainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailingconditions continued until next month.    Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped thelosses would be offset by the expected increase in output inother, normally more productive areas not affected by the dryspell.    Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.    About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.    Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has beenhit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national totalthus the damage is considered negligible.    In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled byproduction from non-traditional corn farms which diversifiedinto the cash crop from sugar two years ago.     The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut productionin the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were noreports of actual damage.

AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS Australia could lose valuable wheatmarkets through lack of availability if plantings for thecoming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, AustralianWheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.    "If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings provetrue, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of itsvaluable markets," he said in a statement.    Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWBspokesman said there was a general industry feeling thatfarmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cutback plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.    However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would becut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers werefacing enormous financial pressures.    He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mlnhectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and plantingintentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.    If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut inplantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developedwith much time and effort, it may have great difficulty sellingwheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.    "Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheatunderstand a decrease in production due to drought but theywill have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision todecrease production," Condon said.    "If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major exportincome earner, governments and government authorities will needto closely examine ways of contributing to the continuingviability of the wheat industry," he added.    Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan. REUTER

The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwestChina has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave nomore price details.    It said local authorities must inform farmers of the priceincreases before farmers begin planting, to encourageproduction of grains and oilseeds.

USDA CHANGES LOW PROTEIN WHEAT TERMINAL PRICES The U.S. Agriculture Department haslowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard redwinter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, asenior USDA official said.    USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at KansasCity and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputyadministrator of commodity operations at the AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service, said.    The department also lowered the terminal price of hard redspring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.    In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hardred spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not tobe identified said.    The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as atPacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.    The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and rollactivity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided uponlast week and will be effective today, he said.    Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiumson high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheatprices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a proteinpremium would remain unchanged.

BULGARIA, ROMANIA GRAIN CROP SEEN LESS FAVORABLE Current prospects for this year'sgrain crop in Bulgaria and Romania appear less favorable thanin 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Belgradesaid in a field report.    The report said the assessment was based on travel in thetwo countries from March 30 to April 4.    It said crop conditions were better than earlier expectedfollowing the extreme dry conditions last fall and theprolonged winter temperatures this spring.    However, in general plant development was at least threeweeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions variedgreatly by regions, the report said.    Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, andespecially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in goodcondition, with little evidence of winterkill, while othersvaried considerably, the report said.    Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak anduneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in thosefields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said. Reuter

U.S. URGES JAPAN TO OPEN FARM MARKET FURTHER U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lynghas asked Japan to open its farm market further to helpWashington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionistpressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.

60,000 TONNES CORN SMUGGLED INTO PHILIPPINES-PAPER At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the pastfew months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting anofficial in the National Food Authority (NFA).    The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortageand corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel havejeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which wasaimed at saving foreign currency.    The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan assaying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnesagainst a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.    Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of cornworth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.    The newspaper quoted Linda Geraldez, an NFA statistician,as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the totalinventory at the end of the January/June crop season isexpected to be at least 201,000 tonnes.

JAPAN RICE POLICY EXTREME PROTECTIONISM, LYNG SAYS Japan's policy of self-sufficiency inrice is an example of extreme protectionism, visiting U.S.Agriculture secretary Richard Lyng told a press conference.    He told the National Press Club of Japan that because Japanhad a large export balance, not just with the U.S. But withother countries, it was inconsistent for it to be 100 pctself-sufficient in one product.    Speaking after farm trade talks with Japan agricultureminister Mutsuki Kato, Lyng said the U.S. Had not asked fortotal liberalisation of the rice market in Japan.    Lyng urged Japan to allow some imports of rice.    "We want to have some access in the rice market," he said.    He said both he and trade representative Clayton Yeutterwere disappointed at the outcome of talks with Japan. He toldreporters Japan had rejected the U.S. Proposal to opennegotiations on rice at the new round of trade talks at theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Lyng said he suggested instead bilateral talks with Japanon rice.    Kato has said Japan cannot negotiate on its policy of riceself-sufficiency.    Asked what the next U.S. Step would be on the rice issue,Lyng said he did not know what Yeutter or the U.S. Riceindustry would do.    Yeutter has promised to consider again in July or Augustthis year a complaint against Japan's rice import ban by theU.S. Rice Millers Association if no breakthrough is made in themeantime.

LYNG WARNS U.S. TRADE SITUATION IS EXPLOSIVE (RPT) U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngsaid Japanese government officials do not seem to understandthat protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Could lead to anexplosive situation and protectionist legislation.    Speaking to the National Press Club of Japan, Lyng saidprotectionist sentiment in the U.S. Has increased alarminglyduring the last six months.    "It is a radically changed situation and is very explosive.We are on the verge of some very harsh mandatory retaliatorylaws which would have very serious consequences for othercountries, especially Japan," Lyng told reporters.    Lyng's comments about protectionist trade legislationappeared to be a reference to the so-called Gephardt provision,requiring retaliation against countries which have tradesurpluses with the U.S., Trade analysts said.    U.S. House majority leader Thomas Foley, a WashingtonDemocrat, yesterday predicted during a visit here that theGephardt provision will be approved by the House when tradelegislation is taken up later this month.    Senior Japanese officials do not seem to perceive thevolatility of the situation in the U.S., Where Congress isincreasingly unpredictable, he said.    "The purpose of this trip is to emphasise the fact thatpatience is beginning to be very much frayed in Washington. Icannot emphasise that enough," Lyng said.    In talks with Japanese Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Katoyesterday, Lyng and Trade representative Clayton Yeutter askedJapan to begin negotiations on its rice policy and end importquotas on beef and citrus.    Lyng said he was disappointed Kato rejected the U.S.Request but hoped it would not lead to a protectionist responsein Congress, where legislation on rice retaliation has beenintroduced in both the House and Senate.    Lyng said the U.S. Is dependent on Japan as a market forexports because Japan has been the largest buyer of U.S. Farmproducts since 1964, especially grains.    He said the U.S. Understands Japan, with a limited landarea, is concerned about maintaining some level ofself-sufficiency in food for national security reasons.    But he argued the freeing of farm product imports would notnecessarily weaken Japanese agriculture.    Lyng pledged the U.S. Will never again embargo shipments offarm products as it did in 1973.

Argentine exports of sorghum to Spain fell to zero lastyear from 300,000 tonnes in 1985, while maize sales fell to15,000 tonnes from 994,000, official EC statistics show.    The sources noted that an agreement between the EC and theU.S. guarantees special access to the Spanish market for twomln tonnes of non-EC maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum eachyear for the next four years.    But they said various details of this accord will tend toinhibit imports from Argentina.    These include a provision for reduction of the amounts ifSpain imports cereals substitutes, and the EC's plan to importthe special maize and sorghum on a regular monthly basis.Argentina tends to have exportable quantities only three orfour times a year.

TOP NATIONS AGREE OVER FARM TRADE ISSUE Ministers from the majortrading nations have for the first time made a concertedcommitment to review the whole distorted structure of worldfarm trade, Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney said.    "We think we can get some movement on this," she toldreporters at a briefing following informal talks with the U.S.,Japanese and European Community (EC) trade ministers here.    Canada, strongly supported by Australia, has championed thecause of both developed and developing nations which have seentheir farm trade suffer largely due to a farm subsidy warbetween the United States and the EC.    Japan"s protected agricultural markets have also attractedcriticism.    The issue is of extreme importance to many indebted,developing nations which often rely totally on one or two farmsector exports to sustain their economies but which cannotcompete with the subsidised U.S. And EC products.    "Canada can afford so many billions of dollars (to do so),but many countries cannot," said Carney.    She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitudeand had raised proposals similar to those of Canada under whichto discuss the issue.    Talks will now continue at the Organisation of EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD), which meets next month, andat the series of discussions on a new world trading framework,begun at Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year.    Carney said Japan had also agreed to take a positive rolein the farm talks, and that the United States was willing tosee short-term progress, as long as long-term solutions werenot affected.    Canada"s five point programme demands that farm productprices must reflect open world market prices, that any supportfor farmers incomes should not be linked to productionincentives, that there should be no new farm subsidies, no newfarm import barriers, and that any decisions should beimplemented collectively.    The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by theindustrialised world until Canada raised it last year at theTokyo summit of seven leading industrial powers.    The distortions created by subsidies and protectionism havecreated some absurd situations.    For example, to protect its farmers the Japanese governmentbuys Canadian wheat and sells it at 10 times the purchase priceto Japanese consumers.    "So we end up borrowing in the Japanese (financial) marketto help pay subsidies to keep our farmers while they make aprofit on our wheat to help pay the price support for theirfarmers," said Carney.    The problem causes pain for many nations and increases thealready dangerously high debts that they owe mainly to U.S.,Japanese and EC banks. REUTER
NORTHERN VIETNAMESE RICE CROP THREATENED Insects are threatening to destroy367,000 hectares or about one-third of the spring rice crop innorthern Vietnam, Hanoi radio reported.    Drought has hit another 189,000 hectares, with 40,000hectares very badly affected, it said.    Insecticides are in short supply so only the mostendangered rice fields should be sprayed, the radio added.    The affected areas -- the Red River delta and other coastalareas in northern Vietnam -- produce between 30 to 40 per centof the country's rice.    The radio report, monitored in Bangkok on April 20 but onlytranslated here over the weekend, said the threatened damagewas spread over twice as large an area as last year.    Vietnam has not been able to grow enough food for itsexpanding population, with the Soviet Union buying rice inThailand and Burma in recent years for supply to Vietnam.

THAILAND TO SEEK CLARIFICATION ON U.S. RICE PRICES Thailand will this week seekclarification from the U.S. About its decision to freeze riceexport prices from January to early April, Commerce MinisterMontri Pongpanich said.    Montri told reporters he will seek a meeting with U.S.Ambassador William Brown to determine why the U.S. Failed toset its weekly rice prices in accordance with rising worldprices during the period.    He said the U.S. Has followed a policy of weakening worldrice prices by announcing highly subsidised export prices lowerthan those quoted by Thai traders.    Thai officials said weekly rice prices as announced by theU.S. Agriculture Department were unchanged for 11 weeks up toApril 8.    Thailand, a major rice exporter, has criticised the U.S.Farm Act which provides heavy subsidies to U.S. Exportersenabling them to compete with Thai exporters.    Thai officials said average export prices of Thai rice fell19 pct last year and another 5.8 pct during the first quarterthis year.    The Board of Trade said Thailand exported 1.23 mln tonnesin January/March, down from 1.29 mln a year ago.    It said the export decline was partly due to the reluctanceof Thai traders to accept all foreign orders as world pricesdid not rise in line with firming domestic prices.    The board said, however, that Thailand may export more ricelater this year, especially to Africa, the Middle East andAsia, due to lower production in many drought affected Africancountries and to expected small exportable surpluses in Burmaand Pakistan.    It said Thai rice exports to nine major African buyers roseto 351,889 tonnes during the first quarter from 93,038 a yearearlier. REUTER
SEOUL UNVEILS SHOPPING LIST OF U.S. GOODS South Korea unveiled a shopping list of2.6 billion dlrs of U.S. Goods in line with its new policy ofseeking to limiting its trade surplus to ease trade frictionwith Washington.    The government said this would help freeze this year'strade surplus with the United States at the 1986 level.    "The surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dollars last yearfrom 4.3 billion in 1985, was projected to top 10 billion thisyear but the government has taken steps to constrain it to theseven billion dollar level," one Trade Ministry official toldReuters.    A government statement said the 2.6 billion dlrs was inaddition to about two billion dlrs of purchases made last monthby a South Korean trade mission to the United States.    The announcement follows a visit here this week by U.S.Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who said that if SouthKorea wanted to avoid protectionist retaliation it should notfalter in its policies to open its market and cut its surplus.    The statement said the government, state agencies and otherpublic institutions would buy 480 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Cars,computers, helicopters, ambulances, motorcycles, medical andlaboratory equipment and other products. "This amounts includes89 mln dlrs worth of purchases which were not originallyreflected in their budgets," it added.    The list includes 1.13 billion dlrs of capital goods, 700mln of farm products, 50 mln of aluminium, zinc, polyethyleneand other raw materials, and 250 mln of steel, electronics andshipbuilding parts which would be shifted from other nations.    Agriculture Ministry officials said South Korea had alreadybought 310 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Wheat, raw cotton, corn andsoybeans.    This meant the country would buy from the United Statesnearly all of the 1.27 billion dlrs of its planned imports ofsuch commodities this year, they said.    The government will also take steps to reduce tariffs,accelerate the opening of its markets, voluntarily restrainexports and cut export financing, the statement said.

SHULTZ SAYS U.S. WHEAT BONUS OFFER UP TO USDA U.S. Secretary of State GeorgeShultz said it was up to the Agriculture Department to decidewhether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union.    Shultz told the Newspaper Farm Editors of America that a wheat bonus offer to the Soviet Union "is something that Ibasically leave to the Agriculture Department to figure out."    Last year, Shultz spoke out against President Reagan'sdecision to offer subsidized U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union --an offer Moscow spurned.    "I've always been a little put off by the idea that we wouldarrange our food supplies so as to price them in such a waythat the Soviet housewife could buy American-produced food forless than the American housewife could buy it," Shultz said.    "It also seems to me that if we are going to sell in worldmarkets, we have to meet the price," he added.    Shultz called proposals to broaden the eligibility criteriaof USDA's export enhancement program (EEP) to include all U.S.customers "questionable."    An across-the-board EEP would mark a "considerable change" inthe current program, which Shultz said is designed "to say toother countries that subsidize, particularly the EuropeanCommon Market, that we're not going to give up our markets tothose subsidized sales and we'll have a little kit bag thatwill meet that competition and hold our markets for ourfarmers."    "If you just go across-the-board and subsidize everything,that's a different order of program and seems to me quitequestionable," he said. Reuter
EC OFFICIALS PLAN NEW EFFORT ON FARM PRICE TALKS European Community (EC) leaders hopeto make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks onreforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when ECagriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions herethis morning.    Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessenmet Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night toplan a new initiative.    Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker, who currently chairs ECfarm ministers' meetings, were said to be disappointed by thelack of progress in the talks so far this week.    The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a toughpackage involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct infarmers' returns for many crops this year.    Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 butare only this week getting down to serious negotiations.    Yesterday, they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by2.5 pct, and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to ECstores, to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by largermargins, and to impose a tax on EC-produced and importedoilseeds, a proposal which would be likely to sour EC traderelations with the United States.    Diplomatic sources said ministers, all of whom are opposedto at least one of these propositions, maintained entrenchedpositions yesterday, making the task of de Keersmaeker insteering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one.    They said he could also be treading a minefield if hesought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers overplans to change the system by which EC farm prices, expressedin a notional common currency, are translated into thecurrencies of member states.    West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday hewould veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area,saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currencynations.    The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present apaper to his colleagues which, while not having the status of acompromise proposal, would attempt to narrow their options.    But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministerslike Kiechle, with his commitment to maintaining traditionalrural patterns, and others who see runaway farm spending asunacceptable economically, is likely to prove extremelydifficult to bridge.    They agreed with EC farmers' union association presidentHans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in Juneappeared to be the best that could be hoped for. Reuter

WEST GERMAN TAPIOCA USE SEEN DECLINING West German use of tapioca is likely todecline further despite favourable prices and import licencesfor only 420,000 tonnes have been registered since the start ofthe current agricultural year, compared with 640,000 tonnesduring August/April the previous year, trade sources said.    The 12 European Community (EC) countries have licensed atotal of 4.22 mln tonnes, while at the same year-earlier periodthe EC contracted for 3.17 mln tonnes, they said.    The Netherlands is registering an increase in licences toaround 2.9 mln tonnes, up 400,000 tonnes from last year, theysaid.    Total EC tapioca imports during the current agriculturalyear are expected to stagnate at last year's level of around6.0 mln tonnes, the sources said.    They reported a rise in consumption and in import licencesfor France, Spain and Belgium but said the West German compoundfeed industry was increasingly using grain in feed mixtures.    Sellers quoted tapioca for nearby delivery at around 27marks per 100 kilos against 37 marks in March and 34 marks inApril last year.    Feed barley was quoted at about 42 marks per 100 kilos,resulting in higher West German feed stuff prices, but demandwas seen as slack.    The sources said the West German feed industry was tryingto help cut the grain surplus through increased use of grain infeed mixtures.    Other EC member countries are likely to take advantage ofthe lower tapioca prices, they said. REUTER

EC FARM MINISTERS END PRICES MEETING STILL DIVIDED European Community (EC) agricultureministers ended a three-day meeting in Luxembourg still deeplydivided over plans by the EC Commission to curb the cost of theEC's farm policy through sharp cuts in farm returns.    Their chairman, Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker, told a newsconference after the meeting he would work on a paper settingout possible compromise solutions in the next two weeks, withthe hope that the ministers can get down to detailednegotiations at a meeting in Brussels on May 18.    But diplomats said the talks this week had served littlemore than to clarify member states' positions on the complexpackage of measures proposed by the commission.    The executive body has proposed measures which would resultin price cuts this year for many crops of upwards of 10 pct.    Other controversial plans include a tax on EC-produced andimported oilseeds and fats to bring in two billion Europeancurrency units, to help the EC's cash crisis, and changes inthe conversion of EC common farm prices into nationalcurrencies which would inflict extra burdens on West German andDutch farmers.    De Keersmaeker attempted yesterday to narrow differencesbetween EC states on the oils tax proposal, the currencymeasures and the key question of cereals prices and associatedmeasures.    But he told journalists, "We have used this meeting to reachthe point at which real negotiations can start at the nextmeeting. Ideally they should have started now but ourprocedures took much longer than planned."    Ministers are in theory supposed to agree a price packageby April 1 each year, although this target is seldom reached inpractice.    Diplomats said on all the points there were widelydiverging views, with Britain and the Netherlands, thecountries most supportive of commission proposals for cerealsprice cuts, strongly opposed to the oils tax.    However, de Keersmaeker said West German objections to themonetary proposals could prove the most difficult issue toresolve. "This is a very tough political nut, and because of thevery nature of the problem there is no technical solution," hesaid. Commission sources said farm commissioner FransAndriessen was prepared to alter some technical aspects of hisproposals to make an agreement easier.    However, because of the EC's budgetary crisis, he hadlittle room for concessions to pleas for a cut in the impact ofhis proposals on farmers' incomes as several ministers, led byGermany's Ignaz Kiechle, are demanding.    EC Commission president Jacques Delors has warned that theEC will have an accumulated budgetary deficit of over fivebillion Ecus by the end of this year, even if the commissionfarm price package is adopted in its entirety.

SOVIET SPRING CROPS SOWN ON ONLY 11 PCT OF LAND Soviet farmers had sown spring cropson only 15.8 mln hectares or 11 pct of cultivated land by April27, compared with 26.2 mln ha by April 21, 1986, Izvestia said.    Grains and pulses (except maize) were sown on 6.7 mln ha,compared with 13.1 mln at the same time last year, it added.    Spring sowing is off to a slow start, with planting two tofour weeks behind schedule in many areas of the Ukraine,Byelorussia and Russia, because the winter was unusually cold.    Western agricultural experts believe the crop could stillbe good but heavy winterkill will make it difficult to reachthe 1987 grain target of 232 mln tonnes. The 1986 crop was 210mln. Reuter
CCC ACEPTS BONUS BID ON WHEAT TO ZAIRE - USDA The Commodity Credit Crporation hasaccepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of 8,000tonnes of hard red winter wheat to Zaire, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment said.    The wheat is scheduled for shipment May 11-June 11, 1987,the department said.    The bonus, to Continental Grain Co, was 32.55 dlrs pertonne and will be paid in the form of commodities from CCCstocks.    An additional 7,000 tonnes of wheat are still available toZaire under the Export Enhancement program initiative announcedon October 17, 1986, it said. Reuter
BANGLADESH KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN ON GRAIN PENALTY Bangladesh is keeping its options open onwhether to seek a penalty from Continental Grain Co of theUnited States for alleged breach of a wheat shipment contract,but is also asking the company to expedite shipment of thecargo, a senior Food Ministry official said.    The official, who declined to be named, said the companyunder a deal agreed to ship 100,000 tonnes of wheat by April 7and another 100,000 tonnes by April 16. But it shipped only126,000 tonnes altogether.    The supplier will have to pay penalty at a rate of two dlrsper tonne for every delayed day according to a document signedby both the Food Ministry and the suppliers' agent in Dhaka, hetold Reuters.    "If they arrange quick shipment, we may take a lenient view,"the official said. The issue is expected to be decided at acabinet meeting scheduled for next Sunday, he added.    A pro-government Bengali daily "Dainik Janata" reported todaythat Continental Grain could face a penalty of 200 mln taka(6.49 mln dlrs) for alleged failure to maintain shipmentschedule.    The local agent of Continental Grain, Shafi AhmedChoudhury, told Reuters he applied to the Bangladesh governmentfor an extension of the shipment period because loading ofwheat at London was being delayed due to bad weather and afaulty elevator at a grain silo. But the government has not yetgranted the extension, he said.    Choudhury said the freight rate and price of wheat had goneup after the deal was signed, which resulted in a financialloss to the company.    He said he was not "officially informed" of the move toimpose a penalty, although he was "not totally unaware of it."    Continental Grain officials in New York declined tocomment. Reuter
CHINA PROVINCE BECOMES GRAIN IMPORTER The south China province of Guangdong isimporting millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas andother parts of China because farmers have switched from grainto more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.    The official magazine said the province's grain area fellto 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of atotal farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.    Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in partto supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, themagazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.    The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of nationalfarmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct underother crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.    It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity andlow productivity make grain the least profitable farmcommodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuanfrom cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.    It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted onlygradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system. REUTER
FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE The U.S. Department of Agriculture'sforecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks willalmost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not besurprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.    The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'Association and the National Union of Agricultural and CerealCooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports orend-of-season stocks.    However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mlnwas not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.    The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecastin mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare forsoft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 andthe record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.    This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry ofAgriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectaresagainst 4.61 mln in 1986/87.    ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaignwill be released at the beginning of September, an ONICofficial said.    Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult toestimate at this stage, both within the European Community andto non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.    He said, however, that among countries to which Francecould increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghrebcountries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.    The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,was not out of line with estimates of the French MaizeProducers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.    Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields wereexpected to be higher, the AGPM official said.    It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87. Reuter
ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT The Zambian government today announcedminor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its neweconomic strategy, while police and troops patrolled thenorthern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.    However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,were not affected by the cuts and many people said this couldprovoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected moresweeping reductions.    Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with thesmall extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct onitems such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.    Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone saidgovernment forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.    In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no signof troops or police reinforcements on the streets.    President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to takeaccount of lower import costs following the revaluation of thekwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.    The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economicstrategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerityprogram.    Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs ofunemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatileregion to take action against shops that did not reduce theirprices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed inthe Copperbelt during food riots last December after thegovernment tried to lift maize subsidies. Reuter

ITALIAN BARLEY CROP REPORTED IN GOOD CONDITION Italy's barley crop is generally in goodcondition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, theagricultural marketing information and research board Irvamsaid.    First consignments were expected to be available aroundmid-June.    Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods ofsunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,which was expected to lose a large part of its barley cropbecause of extreme dryness.    Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's lowlevels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.    Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, nationalproduction would be around two pct higher than in the previousseason at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.    If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achievedin 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, anincrease of 11 pct compared to 1986. Reuter
U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO SPEED UP CORN PAYMENTS The House Agriculture Committee votedto make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiencypayments immediately instead of in the late fall.    A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senatefloor last week.    The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allowso-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather thanlate this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would notbe changed.

NO YIELD DAMAGE YET IN U.S. CORN, BEANS - USDA The U.S. corn and soybean crops arein mostly good condition and have not suffered any yielddeterioration from recent hot, dry weather, AgricultureDepartment and private weather and crop analysts said.    "I don't see any reduction in yield potential yet," NortonStrommen, chief meteorologist at USDA told Reuters. "The (cornand soybean) crop is actually in mostly good condition and isprogressing ahead of normal, which is good," he said.    Abnormally hot, dry weather in midwestern crop areassparked a sharp rally in Chicago futures today, causing newcrop soybeans to advance the 30 cent daily limit to 6.14 dlrsper bushel and September corn to go up 12 cents to 2.81 dlrs.    "This rally is amazing," a private crop analyst said. "Corn,soybeans and wheat are in excellent condition."    The USDA meteorologist said the only effects of the warm,dy weather on crops so far has probably been to speed updevelopment of the crop, which will help the crop better copewith stress later in its more critical growing period.    "What this weather will do is simply push the crop towardsrapid development of a good, deep root system to draw on thesubsoil reserve. It actually strengthens the crop to go througha little stress early on," Strommen said.    Strommen noted that subsoil moisture is in good shape inmost growing areas.    Strommen and other private crop analysts noted corn andsoybeans will not enter their critical growth stages until Julyand August.    But because of its early development this year, Strommensaid the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproductionperiod by the first of July.    "Weatherwise, if the market is truly concerned about corn orsoybeans, it should be more concerned about corn. But thedryness still has to last for another two to three weeks," ananalyst said.    Soybeans, on the other hand, can withstand several moreweeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating, cropanalysts agreed.    August and September are the critical yield-producingmonths for soybeans, Strommen said.    "The sole purpose of the soybean plant is to simply surviveduring May, June and July until the August rains whichdetermine the crop," a crop analyst said.    Some analysts contend, however, that in certain growingareas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensurethat there will not be problems later.    Strommen noted the USDA's current six to 10 day weatherforecast calls for above normal temperatures and below normalprecipitation in much of the corn belt.    "This opens up all sorts of speculation," he said. Reuter
HOT WEATHER PUSHES CBT GRAINS TO NEW HIGHS Hot, dry weather over the Midwest, withmore forecast, pushed grain futures prices to new highs todayon the Chicago Board of Trade.    Soybean futures led the advance, closing up the30-cent-per-bushel daily trading limit in contracts fordelivery after this year's fall harvest. All months setlife-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs abushel.    "The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter thannormal for some time out," said David Bartholomew, assistantvice president for Merrill Lynch. "We have probably gone ashigh as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how tomeasure the euphoria level."    Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week,posted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limitin new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs.    Corn futures set contract highs in March through September,with December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4dlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improvedharvest conditions in the southern Midwest.    The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybeanplants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefityoung plants by encouraging the development of deep rootsystems, Bartholomew said.    European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed toactive buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybeanorders went unfilled at the close, traders said.    After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)meteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have notsuffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather.    Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of thedollar, which can depress prices by making grains moreexpensive for foreign buyers.    But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York'sCOMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settlesteady.    Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that theweather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears ofinflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures,which closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S.trade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices.    A USDA report released after trading said the number ofcattle being fed in seven major producing states was abovelevels expected by traders. Traders said the report wouldprobably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the ChicagoMercantile Exchange.    USDA put cattle-on-feed in the seven major states at 7.52mln head, 106 pct of a year ago and at the high end of tradeforecasts.    A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May,up 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said.    Cattle futures closed mixed in choppy trading today as hotweather slowed consumer demand for red meat, traders said. Reuter

JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO LIBERALISE FARM MARKET Japan has no plans to liberalise its farmmarkets, but will try to narrow the gap between the price offarm products at home and overseas, Agriculture MinisterMutsuki Kato said.    He told reporters the move is aimed at deflecting criticismof Japanese protectionism on its agricultural goods.    But Kato said he has no plans to start bilateral tradetalks with the United States over rice, Japan's staple food.    Washington has called Tokyo's rice policy an extremeexample of protectionism and has demanded access for U.S.Growers to the Japanese market. This is closed to importsexcept in emergency.    Kato said Japanese farmers should however "shed some blood,"to relieve the dangerous state of international farm trade.    His comments precede a meeting on July 1 and 2 of the RicePrice Council at which the government advisory body willdiscuss the 1987 crop producer rice price.    Kato said he welcomed the outcome of last week's recentsummit of leaders of leading industrialised democracies inVenice and of farm trade talks at the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) in May.    Ministers at both conferences agreed on the long-term needto cut subsidies worldwide, Kato said.    Kato said that Japan is not the only country to protectproducers. He said the United States spends some 25.8 billiondlrs a year to support producer prices and on its exportenhancement program and the EC 21.7 billion, while Japan spendsonly 2.9 billion. He said that although Japan provides theworld's highest level of subsidies per acre, its subsidy perfarm family was several times lower than in the United States.    Expressing concern about growing protectionist moves inU.S. Congress, he said Japan should make efforts to preventfarm trade issues between the two countries from becoming afactor increasing protectionism in the United States.    Japan and the United States are holding panel discussionsat the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over Japan'simport restrictions on 12 farm items.    Bilateral talks on beef and citrus trade in the period fromnext April are due to start this autumn. REUTER
JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pctto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pctfrom 2.1 pct. REUTER
INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS Indonesia rejected World Bankrecommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, asthe country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarksdistributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations metat The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bankfor this free trade, open economy view is weak."    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages thelargest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agriculturalgrowth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peakedand the subsidies are a waste of money.    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and providesan income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies wereneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well asassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmersshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said thegovernment would continue to maintain production targets for"strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia'sdrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are doublethe world average because of inefficiencies, and the countrywould save money by importing the commodity.    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the needto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugarindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in theagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industrydevelop and because of "over-production and price interventionin the developed nations."

BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS U.S. House and Senate budgetnegotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reachedyesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spendingon agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.    The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.    The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from thefarm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for atotal of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.    The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculturecommittees with difficult choices on how to make changes inagriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targetswithout jeopardizing popular support payments, seniorCongressional aides told Reuters.    Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to findthe budget savings.    Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grainssubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheatand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrsand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza hassaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely tobe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers anda strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who saidfreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other majorgrain export competitors and would not achieve the budgetsavings Glickman claims.    Another area where Glickman and other have said budgetsavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,ARP, levels for wheat and corn.    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong standwithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 cropwheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Mostcommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.    Congressional sources said the only way to achievesignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boostthe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source saidsingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen asunfair to one commodity.    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is mostlikely to eventually look for budget savings are sometightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billionbut not enough, they said.    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculturecommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut onall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including pricesupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to theGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm BureauFederation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities. Reuter

GHANA LIFTS RICE/MAIZE IMPORT BAN DUE TO DROUGHT Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maizeimports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.    Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchweymade the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnesof rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aidprogramme.    The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, followsgovernment concern over "lower than average rainfall in southernGhana and its implications for the major harvest."    Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growingareas throughout the south this year. The Ministry ofAgriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in allmajor staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.    GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequencesof current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the droughtexperiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps toalleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.

PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS Pakistani government allowed freercotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimedat narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech the government had also decided to allowduty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industrymore competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export ofPakistani products.       Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s.    But Haq said now the private sector would also exportcotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets along-standing demand of the local traders.    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed tobring down prices and help the local ancillary industriescompete effectively in the world market, he said.       Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years butreviewed every year.    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcingtrade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it wouldenable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over alonger period.    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been providedfor the export of engineering goods to selected third worldcountries on soft credit terms.       Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 percent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.    He said the government policy was to rationalise andstreamline import controls.    "It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, localindustry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs," hesaid. "Prices have been on the increase and quality of goodsproduced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave riseto smuggling and hampering of exports."       He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freedfrom import restrictions.    Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely fromremittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in theGulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after thedrop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of abalance of payments crisis for Pakistan. Reuter
U.S./SOVIET GRAIN MEETING UNLIKELY THIS SUMMER Prospects appear slim for a summermeeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the twocountries enter the final year of their bilateral grainsagreement, Agriculture Department officials said.    The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of theagreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed upto last February. However, any delay this year should notendanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extendsthrough September, 1988, USDA officials said.    "It will be difficult to pull together the people for themeeting during July," an aide to USDA undersecretary DanielAmstutz said.    Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, thenext talks could still be a "couple more months," he said.       There has been grain industry speculation that the USDAwill offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the nextmarketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultationswere held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.    "I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summeror before the next agreement year begins," a USDA source said.    Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about nextyear's crops, he said, "There are too many variables now. Itwould be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now."

NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG The Soviets have not indicated anurgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikelythat such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summitexpected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng told Reuters.    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he didnot know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheatsubsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.    "Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me thatthere's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (awheat subsidy)."    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Sovietsummit, Lyng said, "No, I don't think so. I don't think that."    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal toMoscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate fordiscussion at a summit.    "It would not be the kind of issue that the President or theChairman would get into specific negotiations or discussionsabout," Lyng said.    "When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary foragriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat wasnot something that would be discussed with the President of theUnited States. He said it's not presidential," Lyng said.    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some majorproducing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and thestill unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any finaldecision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreementwill be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but theAgriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of thelong-standing agreement.    "We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets havefailed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We wouldlove to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.These are some of the questions we need to discuss."    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted fromthe agreement, Lyng said, "I don't know. It certainly hasn'tbeen what we had hoped it would be. For three years runningthey've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was anagreement." Reuter

EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA The European Community (EC) agreed atrade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the countryfollowing the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, ECofficials said.    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentinawill gain additional trading rights on a series of productsincluding meat, fish and cereals by-products.    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals withCanada and Japan and are due to study these again, theofficials said.    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of ECstates after West Germany withdrew objections to increasedquotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,saying that the main dispute was over sales of cerealssubstitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, theofficials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit fromimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular thequota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef willbe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reducedlevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina saidthat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected theirexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. Theyhave been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade).    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolveCanadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain hadbeen affected by the country's EC membership.    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on thefish dispute with Canada.    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The ECclaims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group hasimproved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfiedwith Japanese offers of compensation.    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems oncitrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for someother farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwearand to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.

SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT Recent announcements from Moscow ofnext year's grain production targets indicate that the Sovietsare estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,Agriculture Department analysts said.    USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, butsome earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.    Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst ofSoviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article inIzvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year."    "This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213mln tonne (grain) crop," the analyst said.       In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figurepublished in a Soviet economic journal this month.    USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects arange of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.    Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvestprogress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.    While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agricultureofficial Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would beas good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.    A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mlntonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems wouldbring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes. Reuter
U.S. SENATE PANEL VOTES TO LIMIT COUNTY LOAN RATE  CHANGES STARTING WITH 19 The Supreme Court let stand a rulingthat Northrop Corp <NOC> must pay 31 mln dlrs to a companycontrolled by Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi.    The court denied a Northrop appeal challenging a U.S.arbitration tribunal's ruling that it pay 31 mln dlrs incommissions and interest stemming from arms contracts it wonfrom Saudi Arabia in the early 1970s.    Northrop, seeking to sell F-5 fighter aircraft andsupporting services to Saudi Arabia, hired Khashoggi's firm in1970 as its marketing representative.    Northrop paid more than 17 mln dlrs in commissions toKhashoggi's firm, Triad International Marketing, from 1971 to1975. U.S. Defense Department records showed that Northrops'sales to Saudi Arabia during this period totaled 4.2 billiondlrs.    The legal battle dates back to 1979, when Khashoggi beganarbitration proceedings seeking payment of more than 150 mlndlrs in commissions due under his agreement with Northrop.    A federal judge in 1984 threw out the arbitration panel'saward of 31 mln dlrs to Khashoggi's firm, but a U.S. Court ofAppeals reinstated it last March. Reuter
SENATE PANEL STUDIES LOAN RATE, SET ASIDE PLANS The Senate Agriculture Committee wasexpected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments incounty loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn andwheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.    A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy(D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan ratedifferentials to no more than one pct per year from thenational average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.    The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary toincrease the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by"an appropriate amount to generate savings" if projected cornstocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.    Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat setaside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels. Reuter
SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS The Soviet Union outlined its economictargets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improvestandards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.    Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Sovietindustrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from aplanned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalentto gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against aplanned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures theoutput of a country's goods and services.    He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes ofgrain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscowproduced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has describedmachine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization isessential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively onworld markets.    "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in themachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires," saidTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makesmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987compared with the same period last year.    However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase plannedfor the industry for the whole of 1988.    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recentmeeting that an improvement in economic performance depended toa large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scalemeasures are planned to save resources," he said.    Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet thatdefense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the samefigure as was announced last year.    Western governments view official Soviet estimates fordefense spending as highly understated, but say the real figureis hard to calculate because Soviet military industries areintertwined with the civilian economy.    Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spendingnext year on medical services, education, pensions and socialinsurance schemes. Reuter

CHINA FORECASTS 397 MLN TONNES GRAIN HARVEST China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the NewChina News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesmanas saying.    The harvest will be China's second highest in history butpoor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmershave kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.    Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mlntonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.    Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mlntonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09mln in the same 1986 period.    Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state pricesfor grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increasethe incentive for grain production.    China could not afford to become a major food importer, hesaid.    The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390mln tonnes.
