JAPAN UNEMPLOYMNENT RISES TO RECORD IN JANUARY Japan's seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate rose to a record 3.0 pct in January, the worst since theGovernment started compiling unemployment statistics under itscurrent system in 1953, up from the previous record 2.9 pct inDecember, the government's Management and Coordination Agencysaid.    Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.    Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people,up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier.    Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal tothe second-worst level set last December. Record maleunemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.    Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equalto the record level marked in April, August, September andDecember last year.    January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmedfrom loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly inexport-related firms, due to the yen's continuing appreciationagainst the dollar, officials said.    Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from ayear earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in thetextile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders,down 170,000.

JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT Japan's unemployment rate is expected tocontinue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year fromJanuary's three pct record, senior economists, including SusumuTaketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.    December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since thegovernment's Management and Coordination Agency began compilingstatistics under its current system in 1953.    "There is a general fear that we will become a country withhigh unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist forthe Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.    The government, which published the January unemploymentfigures today, did not make any predictions.    "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemploymentrate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situationimproving," a Labour Ministry official said.    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government hadexpected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conferencethe record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budgetwhich has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.    The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steeland shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employeesand ceased hiring, economists said.    Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed agreat number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo BankLtd's economics department.    However, other economists disagreed, saying the servicesector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by themanufacturing sector over the next five years.    The economists said the service sector should grow as thegovernment stimulates domestic demand under its program totransform the economy away from exports.    Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower thanthose of other industrialised nations, methods for calculatingstatistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned.    "The three pct figure  could translate into a relativelyhigh figure if European methods were used," one economist said.More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from ayear earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo'sTsukihara said.

CANADA FEBRUARY UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS TO 9.6 PCT FROM JANUARY 9.7 PCT, STATISTICS CAN The Singapore government shouldreduce its stake in major state-owned or run companies likeSingapore Airlines Ltd <AIRH.SI> to around 30 pct over the nextdecade and privatise statutory boards, a government reportsaid.    The report of the Public Sector Divestment Committee alsorecommended flotation of as many government-linked companies(glcs) as possible, and secondary distribution of state-ownedshares to add breadth and depth to the Singapore stock market.    The Singapore government owns or backs 608 companies underthree holding companies with total assets in access of 10billion dlrs, the report said.    The report said a study of 99 glcs showed that 41 of themshould be privatised, 52 should not be privatised, and sixshould be studied further because they have foreign governmentparticipation, serve a "social mission," or are defence-related.    Of the 41, 15 should seek listing on The Stock Exchange ofSingapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ),including shipyards, printing firms and airport service firms.    The government should privatise a further 17, includingIntraco Ltd (a government trading firm), Chemical Industries(FE) Ltd, and Acma Electrical Industries Ltd, and reduce itsstake in nine, it added.    These included Singapore Airlines, SIA, now 63 pct-owned bythe government's Temasek Holdings, The Development Bank ofSingapore <DBSM.SI>, Keppel Corp Ltd <KPLM.SI>, SembawangShipyard Ltd <BAWH.SI> and Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.    The ceiling on foreign ownership of SIA should be allowedto rise to 49 pct from the current 20 pct, it said.    "The committee recommends that Temasek Holdings reduces itsstake (in SIA) in tranches to around 30 pct. The size andtiming of each tranche would depend on the absorptive capacityof the Singapore stock market," it added.    Trading in shares of SIA, which has a paid-up capital of619 mln dlrs, closed here today at 10.60 dlrs.    The report said the government's 48 pct stake in DBS, oneof Singapore's four major local banks, should be cut to 30 pctthrough public offerings or dilution by issuing new shares.    Among firms which should not be privatised, nine are to bewound up, it said, including storage and food trading firms.    The report said seven statutory boards should be consideredfor privatisation so as to reduce competition with the privatesector, with a 20 pct ceiling on foreign ownership.    The seven include the Telecommunications Authority ofSingapore, the Public Utilities Board, the Port of SingaporeAuthority, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and theSingapore Broadcasting Corp.    The latter is least able to be privatised because of thesensitivity of its activities, it said.    "The others can be privatised only after various issues havebeen thoroughly debated and adequate safeguards formulated forpost-privatisation control and regulation," it added.    "The committee recommends that as many government-linkedcompanies as possible should be privatised," the report said.    But it added that there should be "a policy of robustprivatisation where initiative is decentralised and order ismaintained through adequate monitoring, control and direction."

According to the revised data there were 94,000 jobless inFebruary representing 2.2 pct of the workforce against 120,000or 2.8 pct of the workforce in February 1986.    SCB official Olle Wessberg said the new figures were basedon a more extensive survey of the unemployed which broughtSweden into line with the practises recommended by theGeneva-based International Labour Organisation.    Wessberg said the new method cut the number of unemployedby about 16 pct. "The way we are now collecting data is far moreaccurate and we are asking many more questions to find outwhether the jobless want work, whether they are able to workand whether they have actually looked for work," he toldReuters.    The new method was first used for the January figures,which showed unemployment dropping to 2.1 pct of the workforcefrom 2.7 pct (old style) in December, but Wessberg said thechange had apparently not been noticed by the press.    Recalculated according to the new method, unemployment inFebruary 1986 would have stood at 2.2 pct, the SCB said. REUTER
FRANCE ANNOUNCES PLAN TO BOOST EMPLOYMENT The government announced a three billionfranc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculationamong political and economic analysts that it is positioningitself for a period of economic reflation.    The package presented to the cabinet of Prime MinisterJacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister PhilippeSeguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franccontingency fund announced on February 25.    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out areflationary program.    Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work formore than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one thirdof French unemployed, government figures show.    The main measures of the employment program give employersfinancial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of atleast two years and stress retraining to help the long-termunemployed return to the labour market.    Training subsidies and exemptions from social securitycontributions are the main incentives for employers.    "Companies tell us that we have to give them a strongincentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labourmarket and that's why the proposals...Are costly," an aide toSeguin said.    The analysts said speculation the government is consideringa reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman DenisBaudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generallyagreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.    He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling outeconomic stimulation despite the government's revision of its1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.    Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin'sremarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulatethe economy through a boost to consumer spending althoughgovernment policy allowed for increased industrial investmentfrom the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan.    The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenuefrom privatisation, to be split between repaying national debtand providing state enterprises with fresh capital.    Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possiblyreflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition onsocial issues ahead of next year's presidential elections.     Divisions began to show last December, when a wave ofstrikes led by transport workers paralysed the country anddrove the government into a new mood of conciliation withlabour.     Officials said that after the success of the privatisationof Cie de Saint Gobain <SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas<PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-yearprivatisation program with the aim of completing a third of itthis year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in1988.    The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgetedrevenue to boost industrial and research investment andspending on infrastructure such as the national motorwaynetwork.   The government also today revived a proposal, blocked lastyear by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encouragemore flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs byimproving the competitiveness of French industry.    The proposals allowing night-shift work by women andvariations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be putto parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoedfor procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council ofState.

STUDY SAYS U.S. EMPLOYMENT NOT JEOPARDIZED BY BORDER PLANTS The growing shift of low-skilledmanufacturing jobs from the United States to Mexican bordercities is not a threat to American employment because it willhelp create new markets for products, according to a studyreleased today.    Richard Bolin, director of the Flagstaff Institute ofArizona, which studies international trade issues, said theUnited States needs to encourage the expansion of manufacturingin developing countries so that those nations can becomeconsumers of more U.S. goods.    His study was commissioned by the border city of McAllen,Texas, for presentation to the International Trade Commissionwhich is gathering information for a report to Congress on whatchanges may be needed in the U.S. tariff codes to prevent theloss of jobs and industry.    McAllen and other Texas border cities have benefitted froma trend among U.S. companies to build twin plants that employfactory workers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.    More than 700 manufacturers are taking advantage of lenienttax codes that allow U.S. companies to bring raw goods intoMexico for assembly by low-skilled workers into products thatare completed by U.S. workers at a nearby sister plant.    Bolin said his research indicated that the shift inlow-paying jobs across the border reflected changingdemographics of the U.S. workforce.    "In the post-baby boom era, fewer workers will be availableto fill these low-skill jobs -- and these workers will bebetter educated than prior generations," Bolin told reporters inMcAllen.    "The jobs in low-tech industries that are being exported toother countries are, for the most part, jobs that we may not beable to fill in the future."    U.S. employment in less-skilled manufacturing jobs plungedby more than 900,000 between 1977 and 1982, largely due to thetransfer of jobs outside U.S. borders, he said. Americanemployment in high-tech industries increased by 634,000 duringthe same period, he said.    But high-tech industries, those in which engineers make upmore than six percent of the workforce, pay higher wages andgenerate more U.S. exports than low-tech businesses, he said. Reuter
