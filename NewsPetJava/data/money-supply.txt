ASSETS OF MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS ROSE 720.4 MLN DLRS IN LAT Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) andDaniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensingreform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds ofthousands of dollars annually.    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license itemswhere such actions will not endanger our national security, andeliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authorityover the licensing process," Cranston said.    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a morerational...licensing process will boost exports."    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloccountries access to technology that could further theirmilitary capabilities.    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels oftechnology, technology that is truly critical, we will do abetter job of preventing diversion of critical technology toour adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in newtechnology development in the future if we unduly restrict theactivities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans toldreporters.

U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER FALLS 375 MLN DLRS IN FEB 18 WEEK,  Quebecor Inc, one of Canada's largestpublishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a newdaily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, presidentPierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview.    The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebecgovernment's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company <DonohueInc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new papermill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said.    "I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... Thisis not definite but i think we will," he said, adding that heplans to announce a decision early next week.    Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs lastyear and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three dailynewspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, thesecond-largest circulation paper in Canada.    A new daily would give Montreal its second English-language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the citythe most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in NorthAmerica, analysts have said.    Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new Englishlanguage tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within sixmonths. He said he is waiting to determine whether the newventure would have the support of major advertisers.    Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads oftwo major Canadian companies who are interested in the projectbut has not decided whether he would take partners in thenewspaper venture.    He said he would consider launching the newspaper with oneof the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.    "It would be the possibility of doing something else in theshort term," Peladeau said.    Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with RobertMaxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc <BPCL.L>does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects.    Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stakein Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of thegovvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and Britishprinting acquiring the other 49 pct.    "In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage ofnewsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper toprint the paper," Peladeau said. "When I lived that, I said tomyself...next time we'll be ready."    Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprintcapacity however, is already committed to other buyers.    Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a yearand Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirrornewspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes.    Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49pct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue's540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies willhave to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or buildanother mill to meet their demands .    He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint orother types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could beon stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressedarea with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by thegovernment.    Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventureswith Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market inFrance or in the U.S., where the company owns two largeprinting plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire.    He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, wouldprovide an entree into the French market, where foreigners areprevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he wouldconsider either buying into or starting daily newspapers inFrance or the U.S.    Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain ofabout 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition oftwo groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiatingthe acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada,Peladeau said.    He said the company may consider starting daily newspapersin two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in theprovince.    Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in itslisting on the American stock exchange for a New York StockExchange listing. Reuter

U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 310 MLN DLRS U.S. bank discount window borrowingsless extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week toWednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrsat 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-weekstatement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451mln dlrs.    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.    A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing thatthere were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserveprojections in the week to Wednesday.    He said that natural float had been "acting a bitstrangely" for this time of year, noting that there had beenpoor weather during the latest week.    The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, tonearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's highfloat, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday'sfloat figure was due to holdover and transportation float attwo widely separated Fed districts.    For the week as a whole, he said that float related as ofadjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections forunrelated cash letter errors in six districts around thecountry.    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, twodifferent clearing banks had system problems and the securitiesand Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or2100 EST on both days.    However, he said that both problems were cleared up duringboth afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserveimpact.    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discountwindow borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pctby the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regionalinstitutions.    On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for bythe money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and15 pct by the smallest banks.    The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excessreserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit onFriday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily averagedeficit for the week as a whole.    For the two-week period, he said there were relatively highexcess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were atthe smallest banks. Reuter

FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY Latest Federal Reserve data suggest thatthe central bank voted to maintain the existing degree ofpressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-makingmeeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.    "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think wecan take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing hadchanged," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committeelast Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up totoday."    Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed mostfears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip onreserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wantedconfirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which coveredthe two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.    This need for additional reassurance was made all the moreacute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves fromthe banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchaseagreements for the first time since April of last year,economists added.    Today's data showed that the draining action was for afairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.    "The one thing that caught my eye were the relativelysizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson ofFirst National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearlyjustified need for them. There was nothing ominous."    "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the newstatement period today. If it had, it would have missed its(reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon.    A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no largesingle-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.    Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discountwindow, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.    For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, thedaily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from160 in the prior period.    "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday andWednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," saidScott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesdayaverage rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.    Lending further support to the stable policy view was arelatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in thelatest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves inthe banking system, economists said.    "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck ofFirst Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein."    "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billiondlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reservesaveraged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statementperiod, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.    After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth rangeto the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, littleattention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billiondlr jump in the week ended February 16.    Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread afine line between the dollar's progress in the internationalcurrency markets and the development of the domestic economy.    "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect onFed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it willtake the dollar into account in future policy decisions but ifthe economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing." Reuter

N.Z. CENTRAL BANK SEES SLOWER MONEY, CREDIT GROWTH Monetary and credit growth rates inNew Zealand are not expected to continue at current levelsfollowing the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity latelast year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said.    The monetary and credit growth figures for the Decemberquarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually highgrowth in inter-institutional lending activity on the shortterm money market, Russell said in a statement.    The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signsof the recent expansion became apparent in September andOctober last year, Russell said.    Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct inthe year ended September.    Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year.    "Available evidence suggests that corporate customers,including non-bank financial institutions, have been exploitingdifferences between interest rates on overdrafts with tradingbanks and rates in the call market," Russell said.

"In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in theSpanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten themonetary and inflation targets set by the government," thestatement said.    Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserverequirement allowed by law is 20 pct.

U.S. MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY, ECONOMISTS SAY U.S. money supply growth is slowingdown rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of theFederal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even havecontracted in February.    A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for theFed, especially as it would follow a long period of torridgrowth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in theweeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policywas justified on account of weakness in the economy.        M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reportedtoday, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminaryforecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.    M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.With other components of M-2, such as money-market depositaccounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage isset for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.    M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditionallink to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact offalling interest rates and banking deregulation.    But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates islikely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill LynchEconomics Inc.    "The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're allsending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrowsat the Fed," McCarthy said.    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, "Wehave some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It'scoming in a lot weaker than I thought."        The economists were quick to caution that one month's dataprove nothing, especially because money growth previously hadbeen so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pctrate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably beexplained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into thebooming stock market and is thus not an indication of aslowdown in the business expansion.    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bondmarkets that the slowdown in money growth is partly areflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides withsigns that the economy is losing momentum as the quarterprogresses. "Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy asthey were a month ago," he noted.    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March andrises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pctor less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderateenough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross nationalproduct for the first quarter proved to be weak. "You'dcertainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past."    There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balancesheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already underway, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in linewith expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Incargued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much tosolve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive tradedeficit. Because of the possibility that further dollardepreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed toclose the trade gap, Brusca said "I'm not prepared to be allthat optimistic about the bond market."

FED WATCHERS SEE U.S. ECONOMIC, INFLATION UPTURN This year will see a pickup in U.S.economic growth and inflation, the Shadow Open Market Committeesaid in its semi-annual policy statement.    The SOMC, a group of basically "monetarist" privateeconomists, said that "economic growth will accelerate in 1987in response to powerful stimulative actions by the FederalReserve."    The group said the Fed's actions have been excessive. As aresult, it said that "inflation and ultimately anotherrecession now loom on the horizon."    The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely onprogressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not leadto sustainable economic growth and stable prices.    The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic orinflation growth in its policy statement. However, theCommittee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it wasbasically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is amember of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.    Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentagepoint higher than in the past two years. He expects consumerprices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.    The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has beena principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costlyinflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to "abandonits inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetarybase on the path toward sustained lower inflation."    The Fed in February said it would no longer target thenarrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 andeconomic growth has been largely severed.

SPAIN EXTENDS RESERVE REQUIREMENT The Bank of Spain has extended thereserve requirement for banks to their convertible peseta fundsin an attempt to curb speculation in short-term capital whichis currently fuelling money supply growth.    In a statement issued late last night, the central banksaid convertible peseta accounts, funds which are not subjectto exchange controls, would also be subject to a 19 pct reserverequirement with effect from Friday.    Convertible peseta funds had been previously exempt fromreserve requirements.    The measure comes one week after the central bank raisedreserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentagepoint to 19 pct, also with effect on Friday.    Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offernow -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- have attracted alarge influx of speculative foreign capital which isthreatening the government's monetary targets.    They say this influx is largely responsible for Spain'sprincipal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquidassets in public hands (ALP), to have grown by an estimated 17pct annualised rate in February, compared with January's 8.3pct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986. Thetarget for 1987 is eight pct.    The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds tobanks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the moneymarket. Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightlyTreasury Bill auction tomorrow and Friday's hike in reserverequirements, expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas fromthe system.    The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interestrates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterday's 13.46 pctaverage for deposits.    Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandableresponse "given that the market is short of funds."    But banking sources noted that a continued rise in interestrates would neutralize the central bank's attempts to curtailshort-term speculation with foreign funds by making the Spanishmoney markets more attractive.

FED DATA INDICATE NO POLICY CHANGE LIKELY U.S. bank reserve, monetary anddiscount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reservetoday clearly indicate that policy is "on hold" and may not bechanged for weeks or even months, economists said.    "The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is notabout to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurson the economy," said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co.    "These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is inprospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue forpolicy change," said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc.    Fed data released today were all in line with economists'expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks.    The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the twoweeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mlndlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changedfrom 160 mln dlrs in the period before that.    It said that banks' net free reserves in the latest twoweeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously.    Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs.    Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actualpositive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3.    February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limitsset by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target.    "In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for theFed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in moneygrowth," said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman GovernmentSecurities Inc.    Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetarygrowth in March after February's anemic growth rates. However,they stress that money growth will not be strong enough toprevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if theeconomy shows evidence of weakness.    Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate,Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in moneymarket deposits at banks. This number has risen three to fourbillion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February'sweakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March.    Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should returnto the five to seven pct annualized growth region and socontinue to present no problem for the Fed.    Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable withits current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhapsseveral more months of economic data before deciding whether ornot to ease its grip on reserves.    Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analystsagreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will chooseto raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it nextchanges policy.    "Discount window borrowings in the past week were about aslow as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above sixpct," said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pctin the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week.    The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs onMonday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it addedreserves directly through two-day System repurchases.    Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds ratebe largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on aborrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs. Reuter

The figure was thus outside the three to six pct range setby the Bundesbank for 1987.

The data showed that the stock grew at an annualized 8.6pct over the six months to February, slower than the 9.4 pctrise in the same period to January.    Of the two components comprising central bank money stock,cash in circulation rose to 111.7 billion marks in Februaryfrom 110.9 billion in January, the Bundesbank data showed.

ANALYSTS SAY U.K. BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balancedby analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.    A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expectedtomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. Afollow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.    "Worthy but boring would probably sum it up," Peter Fellner,U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. "It wasa very, very prudent fiscal budget."    Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was awell-balanced budget within the confines of the government'sphilosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.    Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscalside, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.    As was widely expected, Lawson split his "fiscal adjustment"between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stgfrom 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to27 pct.    The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, waskept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broadSterling M3 aggregate was dropped.    Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way fora half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but theauthorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a fullone-point cut tomorrow.    "The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action whichit will have to reverse later," Jeffrey said, though he added afurther half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.    The main worry from today's speech is the outlook forinflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy containedin it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.    Holt noted the "rather loose" inflation forecast of 4.0 pctat end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to resultfrom the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.    "A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,"he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back offalling base rates would have an offsetting impact oninflation.    The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence butit was "not a good budget for inflation," he said    Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more aboutthe dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was nottoo concerned about a revival of inflation.    Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the"leading edge" of monetary policy, but said the authorities werelikely to be extremely cautious on this front.    He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interestrates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed anysigns of excessive weakness.    Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibilityof the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.    Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility bythe favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecastto be 4.0 billion stg.    But analysts said the Budget speech did not give anyclear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,which has to be held before June, 1988.    Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that thebenefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raiseduties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.    But others said it kept several options open and it was notpossible to deduce too much from it.    James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election inthat there would be no "chickens coming home to roost."    Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a Juneelection, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone fora Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.    Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boostto the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity. REUTER

FEB STERLING BANK LENDING UP 2.9 BILLION STG AFTER 1.75 RISE IN JAN -  The Ministry of International Trade andIndustry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to furtherslash output in the second quarter in an effort to save itssemiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said.    The United States has accused Japan of reneging on thesemiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-priceJapanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened totake retaliatory action after April 1.    The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop sellingcut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports ofAmerican chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.    MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has beenpressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that willboost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.    Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers toreduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request,they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeksof the first quarter.    If that reduced production level were maintained through tothe end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pctbelow that of the first three months of the year.    MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said theministry has not yet decided on the extent of the secondquarter cutback.    One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground inAsia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets thereare picking up.    MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanesesemiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attemptsto ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact. REUTER
U.K. CLEARING BANK LENDING RISES 1.6 BILLION STG Clearing bank sterling lending to theU.K. Private sector in February is estimated to have risen byan underlying, seasonally-adjusted 1.6 billion stg after a 1.2billion stg rise in January, the Banking Information Servicesaid.    The unadjusted rise was 1.31 billion stg, compared with an813 mln stg increase in January.    The Banking Information Service said the adjusted rise of1.6 billion stg was well above the recent monthly average ofabout 1.0 billion stg.    Of the increase, 297 mln stg was accounted for by personallending, which the Banking Information Service said was takenup entirely by lending for home purchases.    Lending for consumption fell around 17 mln stg while about182 mln stg of credit card debt was repaid during the month.    Lending to the manufacturing industry was up 370 mln stg,and to leasing companies by 308 mln stg.    The Banking Information Service said February fell withinthe governmemnt tax season, so much of the lending was probablythe result of industry's need to pay its tax bills.    Deposits by the private sector rose an unadjusted 1.1billion stg in February and by a seasonally-adjusted 1.75billion stg.    Deposits from the public sector rose 185 mln stg inFebruary while deposits from overseas residents rose by 43 mln. REUTER

The narrow measure, M0, fell a provisional adjusted 3/4 toone pct after a 0.6 pct drop in January, the Bank said.    Unadjusted annual growth in sterling M3 was 18-3/4 to 19pct in the 12 months to February against 17.6 pct in Januarywhile M0 rose four to 4-1/4 pct after a 5.2 pct rise inJanuary.    Seasonally adjusted, sterling bank lending grew 2.9 billionstg after a January rise of 1.75 billion.    Of the unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3, bank lendingto the private sector expanded 2.6 billion stg after a 1.4billion rise in January, the Bank said.    The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) contractedby 300 mln stg after a contraction of 3.7 billion stg inJanuary.    Funding - debt sales to the non-bank private sector andexternal flows to the public sector - rose by 300 mln stg aftera 1.5 billion stg rise in January. Of this, central governmentdebt sales to the public sector were expansionary by 400 mlnstg after a 1.3 billion expansion in January, the Bank said.    Other unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3 expanded by300 mln stg in February after an expansion of 1.3 billion stgin January, the Bank said.    Unadjusted figures showed a rise in sterling M3 by 1-3/4 totwo pct in February after a drop of 0.8 pct in January.    On the same basis, the figures showed a drop of about 1-1/2pct in MO in February after a sharp 6-1/2 pct fall in January.    The Bank said it would publish full, final figures on March30.    The Bank said non-bank private sector holdings of publicsector debt fell by about 400 mln stg in February whileexternal flows to the public sector were about 100 mln stg.    Combined with a net PSBR repayment of about 300 mln stg,the public sector contribution to the growth in sterling M3 wastherefore about flat, the Bank said.

PHILIPPINES' LIQUIDITY RISES, LOAN DEMAND FALLS Liquidity in the Philippines rose inDecember while loan demand and short-term lending rates fell,the Central Bank said.    A bank official said M-3 rose 9.72 pct to a provisional149.80 billion pesos at the end of December from a monthearlier for a year-on-year gain of 12.72 pct.    She said short-term bank lending rates fell to anannualised 13.88 pct at the end of December, from 14.58 pct amonth earlier and 19.82 pct at the end of December 1985.    Poor loan demand was illustrated by a rise in commercialbank reserves, the official said.    The bank official said commercial bank reserves were 22.19billion pesos at the end of December, when reserves requiredwere 21.59 billion.    She said the surplus of 597 mln pesos, compared with adeficit of 390 mln pesos a month earlier and a deficit of 1.64billion at the end of 1985, reflected political uncertainty inthe last quarter of 1986.    Reserve money, the total available to monetary authorities,was a provisional 52.58 billion pesos at the end of 1986. Thiswas 5.19 pct up from 49.98 billion at the end of November and41.85 pct up from 37.09 billion in December 1985.

U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - SPENDING, M-1 Brisk increases in personal income andconsumption are to appear in February data released today, butthe bond market's recent sluggishness suggests there will be nomajor price reaction unless the rises are much larger thanexpected, economists said.    Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct,compared with no change in January, while consumptionexpenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct,reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January.    M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also bereleased. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected.        Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Incexpects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wageand salary disbursements in February.    Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, theaverage workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose byfour cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durablegoods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of atleast 1.5 pct in consumption, he added.    The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bondmarket much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slippingjust 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct.    Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrowrange, desperately seeking direction.    "Seasonally adjusted, it's already December in the bondmarket," quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities CoInternational Inc.    Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said thesteadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite somesigns of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectationsthat inflation will remain subdued.    But he warned that this assumption might not be justified.    "It took the bond market a long while to see that inflationwas not returning to double digits, and now that it has learnedthat lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to fivepct inflation is a real possibility ahead," Boltz said in areport.    After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds wereindicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct. Reuter
U.K. MONEY DATA MAY EASE RATE CUT, ANALYSTS SAY Slower than expected growth in Britain'snarrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur afurther cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterling'svalue requires such a move, economic analysts said.    M0, the only targeted money supply measure left afterChancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the officialtarget for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budgetspeech on Tuesday, fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February.    On an annual basis, this put M0 growth at four to 4-1/2pct, in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct.    "The M0 data are much better than we expected," said RobertThomas, economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities.    He and other analysts said while the better than expectedM0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a newinterest rate cut, they removed an obstacle to such a move.    Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despitebuoyant retail sales in February, advancing an adjusted 2.2 pctafter a fall of the same size in January.    Analysts said the M0 measure, reflecting variations inconsumer demand rather than real inflation prospects, was notan adequate indicator to determine interest rates.    "The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 isimportant ... In practice, it is likely to be the exchange rateand the election which call the tune," Lloyds Merchant bankchief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment.    Richard Jeffrey, economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett,said in a comment: "It is unlikely that (Lawson) will respond tosignals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange ratetrends is necessary before action is taken."    "With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres aremade in response to signals from this narrow money variable,the City has been forced to take it seriously," he added.    Noting this point, Thomas said market fears at the end oflast year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared.    This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K.Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up thepound above unofficial targets, analysts said.    Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreedbetween finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada attheir Paris meeting last month, they added.  U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since theParis agreement, once on March 11, and again yesterday whenforeign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cutin 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget.    They stand at 10 pct now, and foreign exchange dealers andanalysts expect them to shed another half-point in the comingweek.    Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher thanexpected increase in February sterling M3, which pushed theannual growth rate to almost 19 pct, well above the previoustarget of 11 to 15 pct.    Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate theimprovement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past fewmonths had been reversed, but firm conclusions could only bedrawn after revised data are released on March 31.    Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased towatch the sterling M3 target, and Lawson's move to scrap italtogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of itscredibility as a key factor in monetary policy.

U.S. M-1 MONEY SUPPLY RISES 500 MLN DLRS IN MARCH 9 WEEK,  Asea Group, the diversified industrialconcern based in Vasteras, Sweden, said it expects 1987earnings, after financial income and expense, to be flatcompared with 1986, when it earned 2.53 billion Swedish crowns,or 371.1 mln dlrs.    A company spokesman said 1986 results were boostedsignificantly by the booking of two large orders for nuclearpower plants.    This gain, he said, will be balanced in 1987 by a return toprofitability by Asea's power transmission segment, which had aloss of 183 mln crowns, or 26.9 mln dlrs, last year.    Currency conversions were made at 6.81 crowns to the dlr.    The spokesman said the company has built up a strongbacklog of orders that will contribute to earnings in 1988 andbeyond.    At yearend 1986, Asea's order backlog stood at 32.7 billioncrowns, or 4.8 billion dlrs, up from 30.9 billion, or 4.5billion dlrs, at the end of 1985.

U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 228 MLN DLRS U.S. bank discount window borrowingsless extended credits averaged 228 mln dlrs in the week toWednesday March 18, the Federal Reserve said.    Total borrowings in the week rose 83 mln dlrs to 502 mlndlrs, with extended credits up three mln dlrs at 274 mln dlrs.The week was the first half of a two-week statement period. Netborrowing in the prior week averaged 148 mln dlrs.    Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended onMarch 11, the Fed estimated that banks had daily average netfree reserves of 759 mln dlrs rather than the 660 mln dlrsfirst reported.    A Fed spokesman told a press briefing that there were nolarge single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections inthe first week of the latest bank statement period.    None of the 14 large money center banks borrowed from thediscount window during the week and all of the Wednesdayborrowing was made by the smallest banks. For the week as awhole, the borrowing was split roughly evenly between the largeregionals and the small banks.    Natural float ranged from a low of near zero on Thursday --for which the Fed spokesman could give no particular reason --to a high of nearly 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday.    The Tuesday peak included about 100 mln dlrs oftransportation float in mid- and south-Atlantic states. Notingthat the weather was "basically good" for March, the spokesmansaid that transportation float averaged under 500 mln dlrs aday for the full week.    Float related as-ofs were a negative 400 mln dlrs onWenesday due to a number of unrelated cash letter errorcorrections in five districts.    As-ofs peaked at just over 500 mln dlrs on Tuesday.

FED DATA SUGGEST U.S. CREDIT POLICY IS ON HOLD Latest Federal Reserve data suggestthat the U.S. banking system is flush with reserves going intoa period of traditional tightness and that overall monetarypolicy is on hold, economists said.    "There is ample liquidity.... The Fed is not going to shiftgears at the present time or for at least another month," saidMaria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    "Technical and seasonal considerations aside, there isnothing for the (credit) market to get excited about," addedRobert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc.    Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount windowaveraged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bankstatement period ending next Wednesday, compared with 233 mlnand 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods.    Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revisionin banks' net free reserves in the two-week period to March 11to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln.    Finally, a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14money center banks were absent from the Fed's discount windowfor the third week running, with the latest week's borrowingsplit between the large regional and the smaller banks.    While modest open market intervention was apparently enoughto defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the lateststatement period, economists predicted that the Fed would haveto be more aggressive in coming weeks.    The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectlyon four of the five trading days via system and customerrepurchase agreements.    "Fed funds will be coming under relatively intensepressure," said Salomon's di Clemente, noting the approachingmonth- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax datesin April.    "The Fed is faced with a large seasonal addingrequirement," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc,who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a couponpurchase in early April.    Economists were also heartened by further signs of adeceleration in money supply growth, not only in the largelydiscredited M-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M-2and M-3 aggregates.    M-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine,compared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. WeeklyM-2 and M-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth.    "The M-1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect weare on our way to another moderate set of M-2 and M-3 figuresfor March," said Salomon's di Clemente. Merrill's McCarthy saidthey could even come in below the bottom of their respectivetarget ranges.    In February, M-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upperlimit and M-3 was 20.8 billion beneath.    Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson's encouraging remarks oninflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas, someeconomists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lendsupport to calls for further accommodation here.    "Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards inrates before anything else," said Salomon's di Clemente, addingthat the key swing factor will continue to be the strength ofthe U.S. economy.    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy'shealth would remain the main influence on policy but, contraryto di Clemente, he said that recent signs of faster growth andinflation could lead to higher rates first.    Drexel's Ramirez did not commit herself either way, addingthat the next major move may have to wait until April 14 whenFebruary's U.S. trade data are due for release. Reuter

GERMAN MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH SLOWS IN FEBRUARY West Germany's money supply growthslowed in February after January's sharp rise but the trend isstill definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement.    Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was onlymoderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits withstatutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply,short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusuallystrongly in January.    In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdingsof German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjustedannual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January.    Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct.    In the six months to February, M2, which excludes timedeposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cashand sight deposits, rose seven pct.    International transactions of non-banks again led to asignificant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said.    Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank againstforeigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1billion marks in February, little changed from January's rise.    But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of theinflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionaryeffect on money growth, the Bundesbank said.    Outstanding bank credits to companies and privateindividuals remained virtually unchanged in February.    A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflectedthe foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise inlong-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities.    At the end of February total bank credits to the privatesector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level.    The effect of public authority cash movements on the moneysupply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said.    Although banks acquired large amounts of public authoritypaper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercialbanks and the Bundesbank.    Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed moneysupply growth to a larger extent than in January.    A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placedwith banks after 6.6 billion the previous month. REUTER

U.S. BUSINESS LOANS FALL 660 MLN DLRS IN MARCH 11 WEEK,  The European Community (EC) agreedtough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks andbuses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vaststretches of the region's forests.    Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreedmember states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next fewyears the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the mainsource of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.    The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, withtougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 andfor all new vehicles from October 1990.    The EC's executive Commission says the emission level ofnitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a yearfrom three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if allheavy vehicles applied to the new standards.    There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use inthe EC, according to Commission figures.    The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to movetowards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonnrequested permission to do so to encourage the use oflow-pollution cars, diplomats said.    West Germany will still need ministers' final approval forsuch a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when ECenvironment ministers meet next on May 21.    But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germanydid not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wideban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.    Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomatssaid. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk nodamage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.    Under EC law, ministers have to give member states specialpermission if they wish to be exempt from Community competitionlaws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implementa ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol. Reuter

A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applyinga more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation.    The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year.    "Money supply control is the government's chief weaponagainst inflation," he said. "The problem is higher rates areattracting liquidity from abroad."    He said this was why the central bank enacted specificmeasures to control the inflow of foreign capital. The Bank ofSpain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirementon new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curbshort-term speculative capital from abroad. REUTER

TAIWAN'S SAVINGS AT RECORD HIGH Taiwan has over one trillion Taiwan dlrsin savings, official statistics show.    Figures released yesterday show all forms of savings byindividuals and public and private firms, including bankdeposits, certificates of deposits and bond's, are running atabout 37 pct of gross national product (GNP).    GNP rose by 14.35 pct in 1986 to 2.74 trillion dlrs.    Taiwan's strict foreign exchange controls and lack ofincentives to invest abroad mean its huge export earnings aremainly deposited in bank savings accounts, earning below fourpct interest each year.

MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS FALL 1.19 BILLION DLRS IN LATEST WEEK,  British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co hassignalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.    "I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation andclear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and theythink the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,"said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not alreadyown.    "It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won thewar and oil prices are not going to crack," said Prescott, Balland Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.    "Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of theenergy issues out there in the stock market, particularly thosethat are acquisition targets," Lazier said.    One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, anenergy-steel concern which had been courted by investor CarlIcahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes aCourt last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.    Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firmsfalling into takeover situations for several years, with theexception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp <AHC>. He said most ofthe majors found partners in the last round of matchmakingwhich ended two years ago, and others restructured to the pointthat they have become unattractive.    U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. ExxonCorp <XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp <CHV> jumped1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco <TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. UnocalCorp <UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY>climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp <AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.    Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost itsoffer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained itwould not raise the 70 dlr bid.    British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.    Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid inthe first place indicates that the British oil giant haschanged its outlook for the oil industry.    Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of themore bearish positions on oil prices.    "They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (abarrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hastyretreat from that point of view," Margoshes said.    "They are more appropriately today looking moreoptimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs(long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe thatwill be exceeded," Margoshes said.    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate wastrading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.    Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buyup the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share whenoil prices were falling last year.    They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightlymore than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oilfield. Analysts also said the company has other interests inthe Alaskan North Slope.    Analysts said the Standard investment is extremelyattractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market andhas hard-to-replace reserves.    "I think it just fits in with their long-range plans toincrease their position in the U.S. market," Dean Witteranalyst Eugene Nowak said.    Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of theBritish government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BPstock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holdingsometime in the year beginning April one.    After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserveswould be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock isheld in the U.S.    "The only way they can sell all that stock is to move itinto the United States. No other market can handle all thatstock," said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.    In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs onrevenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the yearearlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.     Reuter

FED DATA INDICATE POLICY LIKELY TO STAY ON HOLD Federal Reserve data released todayindicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeksand that none is likely at next week's Federal Open MarketCommittee (FOMC) meeting, economists said.    "The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision ofreserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift sincethe beginning of this year," said Harold Nathan, economist atWells Fargo Bank.    "These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will notchange policy," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.    "The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There's no realreason for it to change policy," said Joseph Liro of S.G.Warburg and Co Inc.    Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and doesnot require immediate policy easing and the money aggregatesmay well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.    All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concernnow is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week washeavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurtingthe dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in loweringinterest rates further.    Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line withexpectations and similar to the data for most of this year.    The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mlndlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesdayversus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.    In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at thediscount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrscompared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statementperiod. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.    The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesdayand Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the datareleased today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.    The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of anypressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire toboost borrowings in the second week of the statement period tomeet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.    Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-weekborrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actuallyaveraged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and thatwas up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.    Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming fortwo-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mlndlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate ofaround 6.10 pct.    It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowingstarget since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, saidWells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead onthe funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to6-1/4 pct band.    Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding needare anticipated for the statement period that began today. More    Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to fourbillion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liroputs the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.    To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed toadd permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering tobuy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similarcoupon "pass" may be required later.    There will be a greater demand for funds in this statementperiod because it includes the close of the quarter. Furtherupward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from windowdressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31. Reuter
CANADIAN MONEY SUPPLY M-1 FALLS 555 MLN DLRS IN WEEK, BANK OF CAN The London Metal Exchange's, LME,decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract,with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is apositive move, physical traders and LME dealers said.    Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimumpurity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1,1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pctcontract.    This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-Europeandelivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking atSingapore as a delivery point for other contracts.    Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform withexisting industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-meltmaterial, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded.    The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positivemove by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian andJapanese traders, who would be able to place metal on towarrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said.    Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simplerwith a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almostexclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to bedone during the sterling rings, they added.    LME ring dealers said the new contract would match moreclosely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of therecent wide backwardations.    Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pctpurity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloccountries, such as Romania.    The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declinedas an exporter recently, they said.    Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer fromliquidity problems initially, as business may continue tocentre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, wherethere are many holders of large short positions on the LME.    But others said the new contract would soon attract tradinginterest, given that much 99.70 metal has already beenattracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations.    The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for anew contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, wherehigh grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, theysaid.    Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract willeventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Likestandard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the processin this case may take longer, they added.    Forming a new contract and establishing a Singaporewarehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations,which make physical trading difficult, would not totallydisappear as a result, the trade sources said.    These premiums for prompt metal have become asemi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increasedbusiness and volatility in traded options, and are presentlyaround 50 stg.    Increasingly large granting of option positions has beentaking place. When some of these are declared and exercised atthe end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezesaround these dates are commonplace, they said.    Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Easternoperators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead ofhaving to cover.    But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, eventhough the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between thedeclaration and prompt dates.    These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of themonth, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th.    Backwardations will remain while operators continue togrant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceedsaluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said. Reuter

POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsaid a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciationof the mark would damage prospects for sustained West Germaneconomic growth.    In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairshere, Poehl said "It would be an extremely risky policy to aimfor a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar tocorrect the trade deficit."    He said the United States could face a vicious circle ofdepreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took thatroute.    Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meetU.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and toleratingabove-target money supply growth.    He said he would have been happy to have brought forwardfive billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 tothe beginning of this year, but he said the government facedpolitical constraints getting such measures through the upperhouse of the West German parliament.    But there were also limits to the impact West Germany couldaccept on exports from a rising mark, he said.    Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for aboutone-third of its gross national product, so a substantialerosion of export markets could not be offset by increasingdemand at home.    "A further appreciation of the mark could even be anobstacle to further growth," he said.    Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supplygrowth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation andbecause external factors, including low oil prices andfavourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.    But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemmaover monetary policy.    The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not thereported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germanywas affected more than before by exchange rate developments.    "For the time being, we will have to focus our policy moreon the external side, and we can live with a more expansionarymoney supply. But we must be very careful," he said.    He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan'strade surpluses, which affected European countries as well asthe United States.    Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetaryofficials of major industrialized countries, saying theimportance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchangerates had been underestimated.    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about theright level, and that further changes would damage growth, hesaid.    "This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on thepart of our American colleagues," he said.    But he said there was still a danger that the correction ofthe dollar's value could overshoot. REUTER

FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER Robert Heller, a member of theFederal Reserve Board, said he expects "more modest levels" ofgrowth in the money supply this year.    "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also amost desireable development," he said in a speech prepared fordelivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,Calif.    A text was released in Washington.    He said the effect of lower inflation and financialderegulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.    "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modestlevels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowedafter mid-January.    "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregateswere to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year aswell," he added.    Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.    "The pricing behavior of American producers in response toprice increases of their foreign competitors will be crucialfor our economic future," he said.    Widespread domestic price rises in response to risingimport prices would "generalize the inflationary forcesemanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain moremarket share for U.S. producers.    "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well bethe result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned.    He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to bedisciplined in our conduct of monetary policy."     Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscaldiscipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint ratherthan new taxes.    "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindleinflation and certainly would not make us more competitive ininternational markets," Heller said.    He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pctduring 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.    A free trade agreement currently being negotiated withCanada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing Americanproducers to compete more effectively in that country," Hellersaid. Reuter
SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES The head of Spain's employers'federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worriedabout the government's monetary policies because high realinterest rates were hampering investment.    He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far thisyear were not endangering the government's five pct inflationtarget. The government's perceived need to control inflation bykeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.    High real interest rates were attracting an influx ofspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting thegovernment's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and atarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call moneyrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from11.8 at end-1986.    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call tohold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and newwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanishworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected thestate sector, where the government is trying to impose its fivepct wage ceiling.    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend inSpain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the firsttwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pctincrease over the corresponding period last year.    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of thepeseta to correct the imbalance. REUTER

GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY Four of West Germany's five leadingeconomic research institutes warned that excessive monetarygrowth threatened a resurgence of inflation.    But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, saidthe expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did notnecessarily threaten stability.    The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in whichthree -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise inGNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.    The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome inview of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience hasshown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a pricerise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears mayseem exaggerated, they said.    "But it has often turned out in the past that the priceclimate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank intoa restrictive policy," they said.    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy areless than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.    The four institutes disputed the view that monetaryexpansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domesticinvestors switch liquidity into longer term capital marketinvestments following lower interest rates.    "Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion ofcentral bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to asmaller expansion of money supply," they said.    A return to growth and stability did not requirespectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly withopen market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoidan interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not befocused simply on growth of production potential. Because ofuncertainty about exchange rate developments and economicweakness other factors should be taken into account.    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cutsand avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluationspeculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threatin itself to price stability.    The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growthreflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and thefalling mark. REUTER

Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs rose a preliminary 8.8 pct inJanuary/March 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a yearearlier, it said.

FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY U.S. banking data released today aretoo distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetarypolicy, but they do support the market's assumption that theFederal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,economists said.    "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discountwindow borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rateaverage and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistentwith a modest tightening," said Dana Johnson of First ChicagoCorp.    Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate thatthe Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.    Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-weekstatement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week ofDecember 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.    Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billiondlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total thisyear - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at theFed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more inreserves than the Fed had anticipated.    However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fedis aiming for much lower discount window borrowings thanwitnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may haveforced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the weekended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of theproceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions topay annual income taxes.    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do thereserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billiondlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economistssaid the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of theprojected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started toadd reserves too late.    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparentlyleft Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with whichto enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economistssaid. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of reposoutstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to addeven more reserves but was prevented from doing so.    "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add asmuch as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,"said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targettingdiscount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has nottightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of thestatement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced thatthe Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today'sfigures, he said, "It's fair to say that the Fed may be movingtoward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rateunless the dollar's fall gathers pace.    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing politicalopposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a timewhen Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key toreducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

U.S. M-1 MONEY SUPPLY SURGE EXPECTED NEXT WEEK The U.S. M-1 money supply number to beannounced next Thursday is expected to show one of the largestone-week increases in history, analysts said.    The average forecast of economists polled by Reuters callsfor a 17.7 billion dlr M-1 jump for the week ended April 20.Estimates of the increase range from five billion dlrs to 26.3billion dlrs.    "The M-1 surge will be very temporary. About two thirds ofthe increase is likely to be washed out in the following week,"said Kim Rupert, an economist at Money Market Services Inc.    Rupert said a huge increase in M-1 for the April 20 week isimplied by very strong deposit survey data and by anunexpectedly sharp gain in required reserves in Federal Reservedata released Thursday.    Those numbers, covering the two-week bank statement periodthat ended on April 22, show a 2.5 billion dlr jump in basicrequired reserves. Economists said this largely reflected theparking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock marketsales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes.Fed seasonal adjustments do not adequately compensate for theseand other special factors.    Analysts noted that income tax refunds from the Treasuryalso appear to be coming earlier than usual.    They also are not adequately compensated for by the Fed'sseasonal adjustment factors to the money supply.    The Federal Reserve is no longer targeting M-1 because thelink between M-1 and economic growth has largely been severedby financial market innovation and deregulation.    As such, there is likely to be little financial marketreaction to the huge M-1 increase that is expected to beannounced next week. Reuter

BUNDESBANK AIMS FOR TIGHT MONEY POLICY - SCHLESINGER The Bundesbank is trying to keepmonetary policy tight in order to counter inflationarytendencies, Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger wasquoted as saying.    "We are trying to keep the monetary framework tight, so thatinflationary pressures cannot develop," he told the FrankfurterNeue Presse daily in an interview.    "Central bank money stock does not have to be reducedbecause of this, but it must continue to grow modestly," hesaid.    Bundesbank spokesmen were not available for comment.    On Thursday Schlesinger said in a contribution to theHandelsblatt daily that the accommodative monetary stance inWest Germany caused by outside pressures could not determinepolicy in the long term.    The improvement in West German terms of trade, providingroom for non-inflationary expansion of domestic demand inexcess of output growth, put the overshoot of central bankmoney stock in a more positive light, he said on Thursday.    Central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main monetarymeasure, was growing at an annual rate of 7.3 pct in March,above the 1987 three-six pct target range.    Money stock overshot the 3.5-5.5 pct 1986 growth target.    Schlesinger told the Frankfurter Neue Presse that the phaseof falling prices was over in West Germany.    Prices might still be lower on a comparison with theirlevel one year earlier. But the cost of living index has risento 120.7 in March from its November 1986 low of 120.0,expressing a slight rise in prices, Schlesinger said.    In March the cost of living was steady against February but0.2 pct below March 1986.    Schlesinger said a rise of between one and 1.5 pct during1987 would be acceptable, and effectively mean price stability.    Agreements so far in the current West German wage round areneutral as far as inflation is concerned because of thestrength of the mark, Schlesinger said.    Wage agreements in the public service and engineeringindustry were relatively high in view of the stable cost ofliving. But the higher costs would be compensated for, he said.    "I am thinking above all of the fact that in the course ofthis year we will in all probability have a stronger markagainst other currencies than last year," he said, adding"Without this mark revaluation effect, we would have had to saythat the wage rise agreements were not neutral for prices."    Schlesinger said exchange rate movements had increased thescope for redistributing wealth this year, but this developmentwas unlikely to continue in 1988.    "For this reason I cannot comment on that part of theengineering agreement which covers the coming years," he said.    Some 2.3 mln workers for the public services received a 3.4pct pay rise from January 1. An agreement for four mlnengineering workers raised pay by 3.7 pct from April 1, andthen raises pay by another two pct from April 1, 1988 and by2.5 pct from April 1, 1989. The engineering agreement also cutsthe working week by 1-1/2 hours to 37 hours in two stages. REUTER

The paper said the new notes are necessary because of therapid development of the economy, which has made itinconvenient to carry large amounts of cash in smalldenominations.    Economists have been urging that personal cheques, buyingon instalment, letters of credit and credit cards be introducedmore widely, it added. REUTER
SIGN OF SLOWING IN GERMAN MONEY GROWTH -BUNDESBANK Central bank money stock was growingat about seven pct in the first quarter of 1987, down from9-1/2 pct in the second half of 1986, so there are signs thatthe pace of growth is slowing even though it is still abovetarget, the Bundesbank said in its 1986 annual report.    The Bundesbank set a target range of three to six pctgrowth from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987 forcentral bank money stock. In the previous year it grew 7.7 pct,outside the 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 pct target range.    The Bundesbank noted that monetary policy in 1986 waslimited by a series of external factors.    These included the revaluation of the mark, growing foreignpayments surpluses of non-banks, and currency inflows.    The Bundesbank therefore tolerated the monetary overshootin 1986, as an attempt to counter monetary expansion withinterest rate and liquidity moves would have increased upwardpressure on the mark, it said.    The lower end of the 1987 target range would be realisticif a large part of funds currently held in a liquid form wereinvested in long-term bank accounts or bonds, public bonds orforeign securities, the Bundesbank said.    But if companies and private households continue to holdtheir funds in liquid forms, or if there are further currencyinflows, growth will be closer to the upper end of the range.    "The more the conflict between external constraints anddomestic objectives relaxes -- and many things point to this atthe time of writing this report -- the more possible it will beto do justice again to the medium-term concept of money supplycontrol," the Bundesbank said.    It noted that prices were beginning to tend upwards againat the start of 1987.    There would be virtually no easing of other productioncosts in 1987 to compensate for the rise in unit-wage costs.    "Nevertheless, no inflationary trends are likely to set inthis year," the Bundesbank said.    A link between excessive monetary growth and intensifyingprice rises can only be observed in the long term, it added.    The continuing trend for non-banks to switch into long-termborrowing to take advantage of low interest rates, while forthe same reason shunning long-term investments, increases therisks in changing interest rates for banks refinancingthemselves with variable-interest deposits, it added.

SWISS PREPARED TO INCREASE CURRENCY INTERVENTION The Swiss National Bank isprepared to increase its intervention on currency markets ifthe action can be properly coordinated with other centralbanks, Markus Lusser, a member of the Bank's three mandirectorate, said.    He told a meeting of Swiss industrialists that interventionto support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes inexchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes ineconomic policy.    However, intervention could send signals that wouldcontribute to a short term smoothing of currency movements.    The National Bank was prepared to intensify cooperationwith other central banks, especially where convincingcoordination and significant timing are guaranteed, Lussersaid.    He said currency developments could not simply be talkedinto existence but needed to be matched by actions in the fieldof economic policy.    "Put simply, that means that in order to stabilise thedollar in a lasting way, a reduction of the budget deficit anda slowdown in money supply growth in the United States areunavoidable," he said.    The National Bank has intervened in dollar-yen repeatedlyin the last few weeks and earlier this week it said it hadintervened in dollar-Swiss franc for the first time since lastOctober.    Lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stabilitylay not in currency intervention by central banks but only inan improvement in international economic policy coordination.    This meant that industrial countries must avoid abruptswitches in economic policy and give priority to pricestability.    Lusser said the National Bank continued to take the viewthat easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatiblewith its primary goal of combatting inflation. The bank targetis for growth of two pct in central bank money supply in 1987.    He noted that in 1978, when the Swiss franc rose sharplyagainst all currencies, the bank was forced to abandon itsmoney supply targets in favour of an exchange rate target, withthe result that inflation surged.    "Current exchange rate developments have not, until today atany rate, made any such measures by the National Banknecessary," he said. REUTER

FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY New U.S. Banking data suggest theFederal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady pathand is not signalling any imminent change of course, economistssaid.    But they also said that if money supply growth remainsweak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 declinesuggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen itscredit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetarypolicy.    A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced aforecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to adecline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrsto 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 forthe week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply hasfallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,economists said.    "M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness," said Bill Sullivanof Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator ofeconomic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concernedthe latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growthin the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seenas better gauges of economic growth.    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, bothmeasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.    "Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current openmarket position? No," Sullivan said. "But does this mean the endof tightening for the time being? Definitely yes."    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowingsof 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement periodwere lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed hadtargetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-daynet miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higherborrowings target would probably have been reached.    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness inauto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices hashelped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.    "If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fedeasing at some point," he said.    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay littleattention to weak money supply growth. "It has been a number ofyears since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in theeconomy," one said. "I don't think M-1 shows that the economy isfalling apart and the Fed should ease."    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be aprerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetarypolicy.    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term ratesfor fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar andhigher inflation which would push up long-term yields and chokeoff econmomic growth.    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since lateApril. "The Fed has to determine if this represents afundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this givesthem more room to ease," he said. REUTER
CANADIAN MONEY SUPPLY M-1 FELL 430 MLN DLRS IN WE U.S. crude oil prices are at theirhighest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPECmeeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect anypolicy changes from the session.    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since theorganization's accord in December, have risen on technicalfactors within the market and concerns about supplies becauseof the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from theGulf.    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is tradingaround 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York MercantileExchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is itshighest level since January 1986.    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria'soil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna tobe brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and productionagreement may only need a slight review.    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmationof the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due toa desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soonafter the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increasedtension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, pricesshould begin easing.    "OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreedto in December because oil prices are firm," said John Hill, avice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mlnbarrels in the fourth quarter.    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, risingfrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and areduction in output.    "And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues totrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance thatOPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price," said NaumanBarakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, suchas Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.    "The meeting will be a non-event with no change in theofficial prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, arecommitted to stabilizing the market," said Rosario Ilacqua,analyst with L.F. Rothschild.    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meetingin September to re-evaluate market conditions.    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in thefourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels aday and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, presidentof Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at thismeeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs tooffset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominatedthroughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,producers receive less money for their oil.    "The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,"said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.    "In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not toproduce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore actas a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a twodlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting," hesaid.    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.    "The wild card is the increased tensions in the PersianGulf," said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurites.    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have beenregular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administrationis planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of theU.S. flag, with naval escorts.    "Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisislike this, and just general nervousness over an incident thatcould disrupt oil supplies drives prices up," Knuettel said. Reuter

U.K. SEPTEMBER M3 RISES 0.8 PCT, M0 UP 0.8 PCT - BANK OF  The massive plunge in Tokyo stock prices onTuesday could rob the Government of much-needed revenue to spurJapan's economy, and may hurt banks' ability to lend abroad,analysts polled by Reuters said.    "The Japanese Government is depending on the sale of NTT(Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp <NCCT.T>) shares for muchof its public spending budget," said Shigeo Suzuki, a deputygeneral manager at the Industrial Bank of Japan.    Japan had hoped to raise at least 5,000 billion yen fromthe sale of 1.95 mln NTT shares on November 10.    However, the 14.9 pct plunge in the Tokyo share index todayhas made such plans look unrealistic, analysts said.    "The government could defer the sale of NTT or they couldoffer fewer shares," said Keikichi Honda, general manager ofeconomic research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.    Honda said another possibility is that the underwritershandling the NTT sale would have to pay the Government theamount it expected to get and bear the brunt of any lossesthemselves. "That is what underwriting means," he added.    A Finance Ministry official confirmed that the governmentplanned to go ahead with its sale of NTT shares on November 10.    Another possible effect of Tokyo's stock tumble would be toseriously undermine the asset base of Japanese banks.    The banks lend money all over the world and regard themarket value of stock holdings as assets, analysts said.    "Japanese banks make loans using perhaps as much as 60 to 70pct of the market value of their unrealised stock holdings asassets," said Industrial Bank's Suzuki.    There is also concern that Japanese companies, which haveinvested heavily in Tokyo's stocks as their real businessdeclined over the last two years, have sustained heavy losses.    "Many companies, mainly export-oriented companies, wereplanning on selling their shares for a profit to reinvest inreal businesses as the economy begins to pick up," said oneanalyst at a foreign brokerage. "That prospect now looks dim."    But analysts said it is unlikely companies or financialinstitutions will be bankrupted by losses in stock trading.    "I don't think any company is so badly exposed in stockinvestments," said a senior analyst at Nomura ResearchInstitute. "In terms of financial institutions, luckily therebounding bond market and currency markets are stillprofitable," he added.    The Nomura analyst said a 10 pct decline in Tokyo stockswould be translated into a fall of about 0.2 pct in consumerspending. Some 20 pct of Tokyo stocks are owned by individuals.    Market capitalisation on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to329,588 billion yen on Tuesday from 386,041 billion at Monday'sclose.    NTT shares ended 260,000 yen lower at 2.65 mln each, welldown from their peak of 3.18 mln in April. REUTER
