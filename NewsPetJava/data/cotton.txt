INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW Indonesia"s agriculture sector will growby just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pctin 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates ordeclines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.    Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast tofall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report onIndonesia"s agricultural performance.    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in1987.    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mlntonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because ofa drawdown on stocks.    "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not lookpromising as rice production is forecast to decline and theproduction of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or nogain," the report says.    "The modest overall increase which is expected will be dueto significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oiland palm kernels."    Constraints to significant overall increases inagricultural output include a shortage of disease resistantseeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance byfarmers to shift from rice production to other crops, thereport underlines.    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak ofpests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 whichlargely offset gains in yields.    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are nowresistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, moreresistant rice types.    The government is depending on increased production ofexport commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood andpalm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crudeoil prices.    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pctin 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports risingto an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, thereport says.    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) willrise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports willalso rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybeanmeal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of lastSeptember"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a risein domestic demand.    The report said that Indonesia"s overall economicperformance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slightnegative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pctin 1984.    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsiblefor the slump. REUTER
PAKISTAN COTTON OUTPUT REACHES 7.7 MLN BALES Pakistan cotton production during thecurrent crop season (Sept/March) reached 7.7 mln bales of 375pounds each, up 500,000 from last season, Shafi Niaz, Chairmanof the Agricultural Prices Commission, said.    Official sources said Pakistan was likely to use 3.4 mlnbales of cotton during the current financial year ending Juneafter 2.96 mln in 1985/86 and 2.70 mln in 1984/85.    They said consumption would increase due to a rise indemand for cotton yarn in domestic markets and abroad. Pakistanproduced 540 mln kilos of yarn in fiscal year 1985/86 andexported 157 mln.    The State-owned cotton export corporation was likely toexport 3.8 mln bales of cotton during the current fiscal yearcompared with 3.86 mln last year, cotton traders said.    The traders said there would be 1.3 mln bales of cottoncarryover this fiscal year compared with just over a mln baleslast year. Reuter
CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS Chicago Board of trade grain traders andanalysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned tohandle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of newcrop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeansin the futures markets.    Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers willbe more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans becausecorn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That givesdeficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if theysign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thingrather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new cropsoybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans moreattractive under normal circumstances.    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift thelimited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mlnmore oat acres this year than last without being penalized,traders said.    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking ofshifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to themore attractive deal from the government, they added.    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just sixmonths ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South toput soybean land back into cotton.    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybeanproduction in recent years has been a general shift of acres intraditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

USDA WOULD SCRAP COTTON, RICE, BEAN PRICE FLOORS The package of proposed farm policychanges that the Reagan administration sent to Congress todayincludes a provision that would eliminate minimum price supportlevels for upland cotton, rice and soybeans.    The package, obtained by Reuters, also includes aprovision, outlined in advance by USDA officials, that wouldincrease the annual permissible cut in the basic price supportlevels for all major crops to 10 pct from five pct.    Under current law, the basic support prices for uplandcotton, rice and soybeans between 1987 and 1990 cannot be cutbelow 50 cents per lb, 6.50 dlrs per hundredweight and 4.50dlrs per bushel, respectively.

USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES  Corn sales gained 2,494,900 tonnes inthe week ended February 26, the highest weekly total sinceAugust 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week'slevel, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department saidsales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reportedunder the daily reporting system -- were the first sales fordelivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSRGrains Supply Agreement, which began October 1.    Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and salesto unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.    Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half fromthe previous week's combined sales, it said.    Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers fordelivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1.    Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled thepreceding week, but were nearly a third below the four weekaverage. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexicoand Italy, it said.    Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct lessthan the four week average.    Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy andAustralia were partially offset by declines to unknowndestinations.    Soybean oil sales of 5,400 tonnes were the result ofincreases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes forunknown destinations.    Combined sales activity in cotton of 75,200 running bales-- 44,700 bales for the current year and 30,500 bales for the1987/88  bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's goodshowing, the department said.

CHINA RAISES CROP PRICES TO INCREASE OUTPUT China has raised the prices it paysfarmers for cotton, edible oil, sugar cane and beets to reversea decline in output in 1986, He Kang, Minister of Agriculture,Animal Husbandry and Fisheries said.    The China Daily quoted He as saying China should adoptintensive farming to increase per hectare output and improvecrop quality and maintain arable land at 111 mln hectares. Hegave no details of the price increases.    On grain, He said the state will cut the quota it purchasesfrom farmers by 50 mln tonnes and abolish the practice ofpurchasing through agents.    He said the state will increase investment in agricultureand supplies of fertiliser, diesel oil and other productionmaterials and stabilise fertiliser and diesel oil prices.    The state offers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil andpayment in advance to farmers who contract to supply grain at alow state-fixed price.

U.S. MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE-BOSCHWITZ A marketing loan for U.S. wheat,feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplusproduction situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. RudyBoschwitz (R-Minn.) said.    "I think I would not support a marketing loan now," he toldthe House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans andfeedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of amarketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focusedsupport on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.    A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage moreproduction, especially in high-yielding areas, would be muchmore expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loansand not increase exports significantly, he said.

CHINA TRYING TO INCREASE COTTON OUTPUT, PAPER SAYS China's 1987 cotton output must riseabove the 1986 level of 3.54 mln tonnes or supply will fallshort of increasing demand, the China Daily said.    Demand in 1986 rose 10.9 pct over 1985.    Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and arecord 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show. The China Dailyattributed the decline to several factors, including lessfavorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrictcotton production after the 1984 build-up of stocks.    According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985.    To increase output quickly, the state will raise by 10 pctthe price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quotalevels, the newspaper said. Its official purchasing agencieswill buy cotton produced in excess of that originallycontracted for, it added.    The China Daily said all cotton growing areas in southChina should be maintained, and growing in the north should beconcentrated in Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Xinjiang.    It called for comprehensive planning to coordinateproduction of cotton with that of grain, edible oil and othercrops, but gave no more details. REUTER

AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92 A 0/92 program would have verylittle impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle onlyan additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, accordingto a report from the Agriculture Department.    The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acresidled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mlndlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.    The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.    "The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause verylarge acreages to be removed from crop production is quitesmall," the report said.    "The returns on typical farms still favor participation inthe usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permittedacreage," the USDA report said.    The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to foregoplanting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,would be most used by producers in high production/high riskareas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,director of USDA's economics analysis staff.    "In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that muchparticipation," Collins said.    USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheatwould be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.    Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushelsof sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales ofcotton, the report said.    "In determining whether to participate, a producer wouldneed to weigh the expected cash costs of production against theloan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above theexpected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must beconsidered," according to the analysis.    "What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference betweenthe loan rate and the cost of production," Collins said.    For producers with low production costs, that difference isgreater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go alongwith 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be moreattractive.    Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would bemore incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.    "I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal atfirst, but it is a step towards the goal of separatingproduction decisions from government payments," Collins said.    In a speech earlier today before the National Grains andFeed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is toolate to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup willbe over by the end of this month.

CONCERN OVER "EL NINO" IN PERU - USDA REPORT There are heightened fears that "ElNino" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continentsand caused widespread damage through floods and drought, theU.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Lima said in a fieldreport.    Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area,flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led toincreased concern, the report, dated March 17, said.    However, it said official sources still believe that thisyear's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.    EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds andwaters in the pacific.    The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now beingexperienced has not had an overall negative impact onagricultural production.    Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduceyields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in thecrop cycle.    Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive whereexcessive moisture exists, it said.    However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supplyof irrigation water in the major dams which will improveprospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, andslow the decline in sugar production, it said.    If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru's fishing industry couldreceive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fishcatch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said.    Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are threeto four degrees centigrade above normal but still not highenough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said.    It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino willintensify and carry on through late March, April and Maycausing problems as crops approach harvest.    "There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino-- only time will tell," the report said. Reuter

CHINA OFFICIAL CONDEMNS GOVERNMENT GRAIN POLICY The grain output of a major Chinesegrain-producing province is not increasing, because farmerslack incentives, production costs are rising, storagefacilities are poor and there is not enough state investment ingrain, the province's vice-governor said.    The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui,as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton asthey could growing grain, and three times as much growing cashcrops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pctof farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investmenthad caused the area of irrigated land to fall.    Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pctof the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.    He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain washit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and afurther 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.    He said government measures to deal with the problem dealtwith trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for moreinvestment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal useof or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called thetendency to rely on grain imports.    The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate tothe National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He saidthe government had cut agricultural investment to three to fourpct from 11 pct.    "With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past fewyears, some people got carried away, relaxing their attentionto grain and cotton production," he said.

BRAZIL COTTON CROP LOWER -- USDA REPORT Brazil's 1986/87 cotton crop estimatehas been reduced to 710,000 from 735,000 tonnes (lint basis),the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said ina field report.    The report, dated April 7, said the reduction is based onan expected smaller harvest in the center-south region.    The center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes --25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate.    Hot, dry weather during part of January and excessive rainsin some areas in February reduced yield prospects and may haveaffected quality, the report said.    Nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in Parana andslightly less in Sao Paulo, it said. Cotton entering gins is offairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said. Reuter

U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS Commodities from gold to grains tocotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as lossesin the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears ofinflation and economic instability.    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation thatinflation will be the only way for the major industrial nationsto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said SteveChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co., in New York.    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials fromthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed theircommitment to support its value, and despite reports ofintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, knownas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-termdirection of the currency markets.    "Maybe they have some ideas or plans," said Chronowitz. "Ifthey do, it's not evident."    "It looks like there's no cure but to let the free markettake values to where they should be.    "One way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies," as a measure to correctthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.    "I think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It'sgoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what'shappening," he said.    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bondssaw the value of their investments falling and many are turningto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said MartyMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house ofDominick and Dominick.    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughoutthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cottonposted broad gains.    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in thegrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensomesupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulateexport demand.    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Departmentraised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union bytwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on theChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderatelyhigher.    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They saidhogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal atthis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with fieldwork to market animals. Reuter
USDA SEEKING COMMENTS ON 1988 FARM PROGRAMS The U.S. Agriculture Department isseeking comments on common provisions of the 1988 wheat,feedgrains, cotton and rice programs.    It said many program provisions are common to all thecommodity programs and decisions made in regard to one willlikely apply to other program crops.    It asked for specific comments on the percentage reductionfor acreage limitation requirements under the wheat program,the loan and purchase level, and whether a marketing loan, theinventory reduction program and related provisionsshould be implemented.    The percentage acreage reduction of between 20 and 30 pctmust be announced no later than June 1, 1987 for wheat, itsaid. Reuter
SEOUL UNVEILS SHOPPING LIST OF U.S. GOODS South Korea unveiled a shopping list of2.6 billion dlrs of U.S. Goods in line with its new policy ofseeking to limiting its trade surplus to ease trade frictionwith Washington.    The government said this would help freeze this year'strade surplus with the United States at the 1986 level.    "The surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dollars last yearfrom 4.3 billion in 1985, was projected to top 10 billion thisyear but the government has taken steps to constrain it to theseven billion dollar level," one Trade Ministry official toldReuters.    A government statement said the 2.6 billion dlrs was inaddition to about two billion dlrs of purchases made last monthby a South Korean trade mission to the United States.    The announcement follows a visit here this week by U.S.Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who said that if SouthKorea wanted to avoid protectionist retaliation it should notfalter in its policies to open its market and cut its surplus.    The statement said the government, state agencies and otherpublic institutions would buy 480 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Cars,computers, helicopters, ambulances, motorcycles, medical andlaboratory equipment and other products. "This amounts includes89 mln dlrs worth of purchases which were not originallyreflected in their budgets," it added.    The list includes 1.13 billion dlrs of capital goods, 700mln of farm products, 50 mln of aluminium, zinc, polyethyleneand other raw materials, and 250 mln of steel, electronics andshipbuilding parts which would be shifted from other nations.    Agriculture Ministry officials said South Korea had alreadybought 310 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Wheat, raw cotton, corn andsoybeans.    This meant the country would buy from the United Statesnearly all of the 1.27 billion dlrs of its planned imports ofsuch commodities this year, they said.    The government will also take steps to reduce tariffs,accelerate the opening of its markets, voluntarily restrainexports and cut export financing, the statement said.    South Korea will also reorganise the country's 3,600 tradeagents to deliver better after-sales services for importedproducts and hold a trade show in November for U.S. Products. Reuter

TAIWAN MISSION TO BUY 410,000 BALES U.S. COTTON A Taiwan mission plans to buy 410,000bales (500 lbs/bale) of U.S. Cotton worth about 110 mln U.S.Dlrs when it visits several U.S. States early next month, aspokesman for the Taiwan Spinners Association told Reuters.    He said a similar mission last year bought 700,000 balesworth 77 mln dlrs.    He said the mission was buying less U.S. Cotton because theprice is some 15 pct higher than that of cotton from Pakistanand India. The current average price of U.S. Cotton is 75cents/lb, but the spokesman estimated the average price will be53 cents when the shipments are made next year. REUTER
WEST TEXAS COTTON CROP UNSCATHED BY STORM The West Texas cotton crop was largelyunscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last nightthat packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather expertssaid.    "There might have been some isolated storms, but certainlynothing damaging," said Charles Stichler, an extensionagronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far WestTexas.    Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the NewYork cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.   Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25cents.    "What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, andwhen that happens, everybody sees it," said Dale Mohler, asenior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.    Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, whichproduces about 80 pct of that state's crop.    The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. "That's hurricaneforce. But they were isolated to just a small portion of theWest Texas area, probably less than five pct," Mohler said.    "No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in Julyor August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have beenworse," Mohler said.    About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has beenplanted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend ifweather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.    The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavierthan normal rainfall for several weeks, he said. Reuter
PAKISTAN ALLOWS PRIVATE COTTON, RICE EXPORTS The Pakistani government allowed theprivate sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policyannounced to cover the next three years.    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free importof cotton yarn.    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton andrice along with the state corporations.    He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to makehigh quality yarn available to local ancillary industries andto enable them to compete effectively in the world market. Thiswould help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said. Reuter
PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS Pakistani government allowed freercotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimedat narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech the government had also decided to allowduty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industrymore competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export ofPakistani products.       Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s.    But Haq said now the private sector would also exportcotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets along-standing demand of the local traders.    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed tobring down prices and help the local ancillary industriescompete effectively in the world market, he said.       Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years butreviewed every year.    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcingtrade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it wouldenable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over alonger period.    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been providedfor the export of engineering goods to selected third worldcountries on soft credit terms.       Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 percent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.    He said the government policy was to rationalise andstreamline import controls.    "It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, localindustry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs," hesaid. "Prices have been on the increase and quality of goodsproduced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave riseto smuggling and hampering of exports."       He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freedfrom import restrictions.    Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely fromremittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in theGulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after thedrop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of abalance of payments crisis for Pakistan. Reuter
TANZANIAN COTTON THREATENED BY LACK OF STORAGE About 60,000 tonnes of harvestedraw cotton may be spoiled by rain in Tanzania's northernShinyanga region because it is stored in the open or in crudevillage sheds, radio Tanzania reported.    The cotton, worth one billion shillings, cannot be moved toginneries in the region because most mill warehouses are full.Many mills are not working because of a lack of spare parts, itadded.

CHINA FORECASTS 397 MLN TONNES GRAIN HARVEST China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the NewChina News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesmanas saying.    The harvest will be China's second highest in history butpoor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmershave kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.    Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mlntonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.    Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mlntonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09mln in the same 1986 period.    Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state pricesfor grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increasethe incentive for grain production.    China could not afford to become a major food importer, hesaid.    The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390mln tonnes.
