BANKERS SEE SHARP RISE IN THAI FOREIGN RESERVES Thailand's improving economy will likelycause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billiondlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion atend-February, private bankers said.    Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.    Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the <Bangkok BankLtd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relativelyhigh interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market,and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan,contributed to the projected sharp rise.    Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected toexpand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.    A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand couldachieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, upfrom a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.    Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at itscurrent pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stablethe five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.    Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold,special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The targetis equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports. REUTER
U.K. RESERVES SHOW UNDERLYING RISE IN FEBRUARY Britain's gold and currency reservesshowed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.    The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of Englandoperations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net ofborrowings and repayments.

In January,capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuationchange that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to thequarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fundswap.    The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England'smarket operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bankof England intervention to curb upward pressure on the poundtoday.

FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES FALL SHARPLY IN JANUARY French official reserves fell 45.06billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministrysaid in a statement.    It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreigncurrency that preceded the January 11 realignment of theEuropean Monetary System (EMS).    Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francsduring the month, the ministry said.    This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs throughoperations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting fromthe quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits heldwith the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).    But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion francdeficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as aresult of using very short-term financing instruments.    The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank andother central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchangemarkets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, inan attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flightof funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up thefranc.    On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct againstthe French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.    The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reservesto 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74billion at end December.    Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.    Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billionfrancs from 75.27 billion at end December.    Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mlnfrancs to 19.31 billion francs. REUTER

He said shade trees had been damaged by pests and this mayhave affected the crop, though it remains to be seen howseriously. Indonesia's main crop is harvested next month.    He gave no figure for expected output, except to say itwould probably be down a little from 1985/86. He said stockswere about normal at 90,000 tonnes.    Kertosastro predicted that exports were unlikely to risemuch from last year's level of 320,000 tonnes. "I expect exportswill be a bit more, maybe 330,000 tonnes, but not above that,"he said. Exports in 1985/86 were valued at 944 mln U.S. Dlrs,but the value could fall by 30 pct this year because of lowprices, he added.    Dharyono said production was behind a five year plan targetof 420,000 tonnes for the current year, but Indonesia is tryingto boost output through introduction of higher yielding seeds,better training for farmers and increased use of fertilizers.

MEXICO'S RESERVES REACH EIGHT BILLION DLRS Additional capital inflows of 1.5billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves toabout eight billion dlrs, director of public credit AngelGurria told reporters.    Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improvedinvestor confidence and because a tight monetray policy hasforced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflowstotalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986.    Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for thesake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool offunds available for badly needed investment.    Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan isdrawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only haveenough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four orfive months, Gurria noted.    Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw onthe commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-supportcontingency facility. That money will be available until April1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fallbelow certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for thefirst two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria saidtoday, "We expect we'll never have to use it."    Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw onthe second contingency facility included in the bank financingpackage - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the WorldBank.    Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signedyesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support thedevelopment of exports of manufactured goods.    He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billiondlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil andexport promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month.    Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from itsInternational Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few daysbased on a successful review of end-1986 economic results.    Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages ofdiscussions which will determine quantitative economic targetsfor 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMFfor the rest of 1987.    Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eightbilateral accords with government creditors within the ParisClub.    Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrellaagreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrsof official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalizepacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks.    In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, hesaid all countries from the Organization of EconomicCooperation and Development have continued to provide exportcredit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.

Bonds and treasury bills will beissued in denominations of 1,000 dlrs and treasury bills in aminimum denomination of 10,000 dlrs.    Bankers said these rates will put the securities withinreach of almost everyone and will create a more active market.

BUNDESBANK GROSS RESERVES RISE AT MARCH CLOSE The Bundesbank's gross currencyreserves rose 300 mln marks in the last week of March to 104.9billion marks, the Bundesbank said in a statement.    At the same time its foreign liabilities rose 100 mln to22.8 billion, producing a rise in net reserves of 200 mln to82.2 billion on March 31.    The Bundesbank provided banks with liquidity in the fourthMarch week by disbursing funds in the money market viagovernment-owned banks. Banks took up the Bundesbank's standingoffer of treasury bills to place excess liquidity.    Banks received more liquidity through routine month-endpayments by public authorities as well as expansionary marketfactors than was lost through the 2.3 billion mark rise in cashin circulation to 122.3 billion, the Bundesbank said.    But banks had to draw heavily on the Lombard emergencyfinancing facility due to month-end tightness, borrowing 5.3billion marks.    Overall, banks' holdings at the Bundesbank rose 10.2billion marks to 58.5 billion at the end of the month,averaging 50.9 billion in the whole of March.    The minimum reserve requirement for March, before deductionof banks' cash holdings, was set at 61 billion marks.

EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE European currency markets reacted quietlyto the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealersranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete tosurprise that the markets should have expected so much.    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currenciesand traded in a narrow range after the communique, whichreaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currencystabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remainingbroadly entrenched in its current trading range.    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase BankAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.    However, she said the dollar could break out of the rangewith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltdin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady againstthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,possibly to 140 yen.    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expectsa dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curbunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negativesentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbankoperators to test the downside.    Concern that finance ministers and officials still inWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour ofcurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along withworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in thenear term, the traders said.    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at thecommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar'sdownward trend.    Traders in several centres said the market would look forfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks todefend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadlyconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policyintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." TheU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.    However, some dealers said London-based operators would beunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the longEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers saidthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stablemarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extremevolatility seen in the first few months of this year.    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of thecommunique made clear the leading nations did not want afurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvreaccord's supposed currency target range.    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets wereready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communiquecontributing to greater stability.    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a bigboost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said heexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marksin the next three months.    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, saidthe communique had been in line with realistic expectations andshould not have produced disappointment.    "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and tradepolicies to redress current imbalances are of a differenttimescale than currency markets operate on," the source toldReuters, "This is a political process which takes time."    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp inBasle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident oncurrency markets today. "Did people really expect a patentremedy?" he asked.    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was onlythe first in a series and said the market would watch carefullyin the next few weeks for any changes in positions.    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus wasnow on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move byJapan and West Germany to boost their economic growth couldlead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary inpushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming monthswhile central banks appear resolved to use their muscle tosupport the Paris accord.

FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES 420.50 BILLION FRANCS I Vietnam's parliament sacked PrimeMinister Pham Van Dong and President Truong Chinh, but thechoice of their successors indicated the influence of the oldguard may not be over, diplomatic sources said.    Dong, prime minister for 32 years, left in fading health atthe age of 81. He is a popular hero of wars against France andthe United States and a staunch ally of the Soviet Union.    Parliament replaced him with second-ranked politburo memberPham Hung, 74, the Vietnam News Agency said. Hung headed theViet Cong guerrillas in the Vietnam War.    Diplomats in Bangkok said Hung, not a noted supporter ofeconomic and political reforms, had been widely tipped for theless important presidency.    That post went instead to Vo Chi Cong, a technocrat whoranks third in the politburo. Diplomatic sources said Cong wasmore in tune with the national economic and political changesbeing pushed by reformists who apparently had gained the upperhand in the all-important politburo in December.    Chinh, a hardline Marxist and a veteran of the wars againstFrance and the U.S., Was ousted at the age of 80. His politicalstance had recently softened, the sources said. REUTER
