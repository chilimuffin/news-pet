EC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY European Community steelmakerspresented the Executive Commission with a controversial planfor the future of the industry which diplomats say it may beforced reluctantly to accept.    Under the plan steel output would remain subject torestrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled foryears to come while steel firms undertook a massiveslimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.    Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed theending of the quota system by December 1988.    He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EClaw is supposed to exist except in times of "manifest crisis."    But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss thisidea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis intheir countries, with orders falling as customers switch toalternative products and accounts firmly in the red.    Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries arelikely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back theindustry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising thepolitical impact of plant closures, they said.    Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by theEC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quotaproduction system at least until the end of 1990.    Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for itidentified scope for closing plants on a "voluntary" basis toreduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.    Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, thatof hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.    Eurofer added the industry would need the support of theCommission and governments in carrying out a closure program,particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments.    The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs thisdecade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes. Reuter
NIGERIA, GUINEA SET UP IRON ORE FIRM WITH LIBERIA Nigeria and Guinea agreed to set up a newcompany with Liberia to carry out the 14-year-oldMifergui-Nimba iron ore project, an official communique said.    The communique was issued after two days of talks herebetween Guinean natural resources minister Ousmane Sylla andNigerian minister of mines and power Bunu Sheriff Musa.    Originally, Guinea held 50 pct in the project and Nigeria16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved,but the project ran into problems over funding and the slump inworld iron ore markets.    Musa said Liberia was invited to join and its share will bedecided after a project feasibility study. This would becompleted in May after which finance will be sought. Officialssaid the study will be undertaken with the help of the WorldBank, which is also expected to give financial support.    Production, originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year,will be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early1990.    On an agreement between the two countries to prospect foruranium in Guinea, the communique said Musa and Sylla agreedthat because of poor market conditions, it would be extended tocover exploration for gold, diamonds, cobalt, nickel andsilver.

EC COMMISSION HAS OPEN ATTITUDE ON STEEL QUOTAS The EC Commission said it wasadopting an "open attitude" about whether a system of productionquotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steelproducts which account for about 45 pct of all EC steel goods.    In a statement, the Commission reiterated its view that theindustry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacityby 1990. It had previously said the quota system, started in1980, should be wound up completely by the end of next year.    The industry has argued for the maintenance of existingquotas, which cover almost 70 pct of all output, saying almostall steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market. Reuter
YUGOSLAV 1990 STEEL OUTPUT TO HIT 6.3 MLN TONNES Yugoslavian steel output will rise byone mln tonnes to 6.3 mln tonnes a year between 1986 and 1990under a development program adopted by the Yugoslav Iron andSteel Metallurgy Association, the official Tanjug news agencysaid.    The association groups together the main Yugoslav iron andsteel enterprises.    Extraction of iron ore should show an annual growth rate ofnine pct and reach seven mln tonnes by 1990 under the program.Iron output is planned to grow at eight pct a year, reaching4.5 mln tonnes at the end of the decade.    Tanjug said the programme would create conditions forraising exports of finished steel products.

Production by the company, Taiwan's largest steel maker, isexpected to rise to 3.33 mln tonnes from 3.27 mln, a spokesmantold Reuters.    He attributed the export decline to the rise in the Taiwandollar, which has eroded the competitiveness of the company'sproducts against those from South Korea.    The spokesman said the company is undergoing an expansionproject which calls for a boost in production to 5.65 mlntonnes a year from the current level. The project, costing 52.3billion Taiwan dlrs, will be completed by April 1988, twomonths ahead of the targetted date, he said.

EC MINISTERS AGREE NEED FOR BIG STEEL CLOSURES European Community (EC) industryministers today declared there is a need for a massive round ofclosures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12-countrybloc into reasonable balance with demand.    The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntaryplant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Euroferwhich it calculates would cost around 22,000 jobs.    Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to thescheme, most ministers declared it was a useful basis fordiscussion, but did not go nearly far enough.    Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure ofplants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes,provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the ECor national governments for redundancy and other social costs.    But EC Executive Commission sources said IndustryCommissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mlntonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and shouldbe closed by the end of 1990.    He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpointthe scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products,typically produced in plants employing thousands of people.    The sources said no minister challenged Narjes' analysisthat four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have toclose.    They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should beexpanded and developed through meetings among the industrybody, the Commission and representatives of member states.    However, diplomats said it was clear from today'sdiscussions that such meetings will be difficult.    They said member states are split on whether to reduce thescope of a quota production system, which at present protectsEC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct oftheir products, while talks on the closure plan proceed.    It was also clear that there will be tough talks on whichEC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and onhow much funding for help to those thrown out of work shouldcome from Community coffers.    German minister Martin Bangemann said his country's steelindustry, the largest in the EC, should not sufferproportionately more than others, German sources said.    But British diplomats said their minister, Giles Shaw,insists that the profitability of companies should be takeninto account.    The state owned British Steel Corporation, benefitting frommassive recent write-offs of its accumulated debts, iscurrently one of the few EC steel companies in the black.    Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a jointstatement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in theindustry. Reuter
EC MINISTERS ANNOUNCE PLAN FOR STEEL CLOSURES European Community (EC) industryministers agreed on a plan for voluntary steel plant closures,drawn up by industry lobby group Eurofer, and calculated tolead to the loss of about 22,000 jobs.    The ministers resolved that the proposed closures, whichshould bring production capacity more in line with weak demand,"remain considerably below the surplus in capacity."    They asked the EC Executive Commission to consult withEurofer, major steel companies and with governments, topinpoint scope for further capacity reductions beyond theannual 15.26 mln tonnes identified by Eurofer.    The Commission will draw up a new system  of steelproduction quotas to protect vulnerable EC firms from the fullrigors of open competition.    Commission sources said any new system would cover onlyheavy products representing about 45 pct of the market, insteadof 65 pct under the present system.    Ministers hope to approve a closure program when they meetagain in Brussels on June 1, the sources said.    Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministerscapacity was 30 mln tonnes in excess of requirements and thatthis excess ought to be eliminated by the end of 1990. Reuter

GERMAN STEEL SUBSIDIES CANNOT CONTINUE - MINISTER Economics Minister Martin Bangemann saidthe state could not continue to pour money into West Germany'sailing steel and coal industries because the subsidiesendangered other parts of the economy.    "The situation is completely absurd from an economic pointof view," Bangemann told the newspaper Die Welt in an interviewreleased ahead of publication tomorrow.    "We are subsidising the production of mineral coal and steelto an enormous extent and at the same time putting a hugeburden on all other branches of industry and making themuncompetitive," he said.    Bangemann said the steel and coal industries were no longercapable of being competitive. Continued state subsidies wouldnot save them but would only prolong their lives artificallyfor a few years, he said.    "That is why I have refused to continue subsidising them inthe way that we have done in the past," he said.    Several steel firms have announced plans to reduce theirworkforces, citing weak prices and lower exports due to thestrength of the mark and tough foreign competition.    Bangemann said everything possible would be done to findnew jobs for the workers affected by the cuts. REUTER

CANADA MAY MONITOR STEEL SHIPMENTS Canada may begin monitoring steelflowing in and out of the country to determine if any steel isbeing illegally "trans-shipped" to the U.S., senior governmenttrade officials said.    The officials, asking not to be identified, said thegovernment will investigate an industry contention that steel imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is beingdiverted to the U.S. and ultimately exasperating concerns aboutthe level of Canadian exports south of the border.    But the senior officials, asking not to be indentified,said that despite intense pressure from the ReaganAdministration, Ottawa was not considering any kind of formallimits on Canadian shipments to the U.S.    "In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time,"said one official who claimed Canadian companies were "fairtraders" in the big American market.    If approved by the Canadian cabinet, the officials said a monitoring system will be established in the next three or fourmonths.    "I guess if we find trans-shipment is a problem, we wouldhave to do something about it," said a trade official.    Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pctof the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the leveljust two years ago.    The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time ofgrowing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports fromseveral countries in the face of a decline among domestic steelproducers.    Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of theAmerican market be limited to 2.4 per cent.    The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreigncompanies to obtain permits to import steel into the country.Currently, import licences are required only for carbon or rawsteel, which makes up less than half the steel market.    Canada exported two billion Canadian dlrs worth of steel in1986, while importing 944-mln dlrs worth of the product in thesame year. Reuter

TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES Steel stocks, which have had a healthyrunup recently, still present some short term investmentopportunities, according to some steel analysts.    But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firmprices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will endsoon. They recommend taking profits.    "It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal," saidCharles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. "Orders will bestrong for about two months, and there are signs that some(order rates) are starting to dive already."    But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison seessome short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp<X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp <BS>, Armco Inc <AS> and Inland SteelIndustries Inc <IAD>.    "There is still some attractiveness to steels over theshort- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates andrising prices," Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations tomake them more efficient.    Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues torecommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.    Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balancesheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment businesshas been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradfordnoted. "It's not a high-quality investment situation yet butthey've come a long way," he said.    "We think the stock will do moderately better than themarket," he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.    Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,against losses last year.    Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, hesaid.    Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. "We had a buyon it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else haveit," he said.    The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr ashare in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, andfrom two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. "But a lotdepends on oil prices," he added. About 60 pct of USX's salescome from oil and natural gas.    Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum ofSalomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. "The company's done a lot(of restructuring), more than the market's given them creditfor," she said.    She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX wastrading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts ashare this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in1986.    Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, hasbeen recommending the stocks since last November.    Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the groupalthough he said the earnings outlook is improved through thethird quarter.    But he sees potential trouble beyond then. "I think (steel)prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,"he said.    Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonaldropoff later in the year. "But there are more positives thannegatives," she said, citing reduced capacity in the domesticindustry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which shouldcause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

EC MINISTERS CONSIDER CUTBACKS IN STEEL SUPPORT A new steel quota system that wouldstrictly limit European Community (EC) support to the industrycould be forced on producers if they fail to find their ownsolution quickly, officials said.    EC industry ministers meeting here considered two keyproposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mlntonnes by 1990.    The first would limit the current quota system, which hasprotected EC output for seven years, only to flat products andheavy sections, thereby forcing other types of steel productsinto free market competition.    The second proposal would link continuation of a quotasystem with progress toward plant closures, although less thana month ago the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer said theyhad abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily.    The ministers stopped short of imposing their own solutionimmediately, instead urging steel producers to try again toreach agreement on voluntary cutbacks.    The EC Commission has said it will come up with detailedproposals in July on the future of the EC steel industry and ECindustry ministers meet again in September to reach a finaldecision. Reuter

GERMAN STEEL INDUSTRY TO SEEK LAY-OFF FUNDS The West German Government will be askedJune 16 to provide nearly 850 million marks (470 milliondollars) to lay off or retrain 20,000 steel workers whose jobsare threatened by the recent slump in the country's steelindustry.    Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor HelmutKohl will review a joint proposal by steel employers and tradeunions at a meeting on the ailing industry tomorrow.    Both steel employers and union leaders are expected to tellKohl tomorrow that the Government has failed to do enough toprotect German steel firms from subsidies and unfaircompetition from other European Community members.    Government sources said Bonn was prepared to take part in acommon effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. Butsince the Government is struggling to finance tax cuts byslashing state subsidies, it is not prepared to pick up thewhole bill for the layoffs, the sources said.    A spokesman for IG Metall, the metalworkers' trade union,said the proposal seeks redundancy payments to 10,000 workersin Ruhr and Rhineland plants. Some 6,000 workers would beredeployed in non-steel making sectors of steel companies,while a further 4,000 would be eligible for job-retrainingschemes.    The union estimates that the redundancy payments wouldtotal 600 million marks (340 million dollars), while jobretraining schemes would cost a further 240 million marks (130million dollars).    Up to 30,000 West German steel jobs are at risk in the nextfew years following steep losses incurred by the industry sincemid-1986.    Extensive restructuring of the industry in recent years wasunable to compensate for the effects of the weak dollar whichdepressed foreign demand for steel, industry sources said. Reuter

Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor HelmutKohl reviewed a joint proposal by steel employers and tradeunions at a special meeting with steel industryrepresentatives.    Companies like Fried Krupp <KRPG.D> and Hoesch Werke AG<HWKG.F>, which saw profits plunge last year, have taken theunusual step of aligning with the metalworkers' trade union, IGMetall, to press for government finance to slim staff levelsstill further.    Government officials said Bonn was prepared to take part ina common effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. Butsince the government was struggling to finance tax cuts byreducing state subsidies, it could not pay for all the layoffs.    A spokesman for IG Metall said the joint proposal foresawredundancy payments to 10,000 workers in Ruhr and Rhinelandplants. Some 6,000 workers would be redeployed in non-steelmaking sectors of steel companies, while a further 4,000 wouldbe eligible for job-retraining schemes.
