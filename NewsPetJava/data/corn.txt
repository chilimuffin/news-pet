USDA SAID UNLIKELY TO BROADEN CORN BONUS OFFER The U.S. Agriculture Departmentprobably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment tocorn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in theconservation reserve program last year, an aide to USDASecretary Richard Lyng said.    Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng hadindicated he would consider giving those farmers the same twodlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987program this month.    But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that thedepartment would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers whoenrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year.    "How are you going to stop the tide," he said, referring todemands that would follow from other commodity groups. Reuter
RELIEF TO U.S. CORN/OATS GROWERS SAID LIKELY U.S. farmers who in the past havegrown oats for their own use but failed to certify to thegovernment that they had done so probably will be allowed tocontinue planting that crop and be eligible for corn programbenefits, an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.    Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn programbenefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops tothe acreage base for that crop.    Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained thatfarmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grownoats for their own use in the past now are being asked to haltoats production or lose corn program benefits.    USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oatsbut not extend the exemption to all farmers, Lyng's aide said. Reuter
INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW Indonesia"s agriculture sector will growby just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pctin 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates ordeclines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.    Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast tofall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report onIndonesia"s agricultural performance.    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in1987.    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mlntonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because ofa drawdown on stocks.    "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not lookpromising as rice production is forecast to decline and theproduction of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or nogain," the report says.    "The modest overall increase which is expected will be dueto significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oiland palm kernels."    Constraints to significant overall increases inagricultural output include a shortage of disease resistantseeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance byfarmers to shift from rice production to other crops, thereport underlines.    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak ofpests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 whichlargely offset gains in yields.    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are nowresistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, moreresistant rice types.    The government is depending on increased production ofexport commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood andpalm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crudeoil prices.    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pctin 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports risingto an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, thereport says.    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) willrise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports willalso rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybeanmeal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of lastSeptember"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a risein domestic demand.    The report said that Indonesia"s overall economicperformance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slightnegative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pctin 1984.    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsiblefor the slump. REUTER

The latest requests for the maize were for export toSwitzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebateprefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20Ecu daily rebate.    The special daily rebate for maize was set in the contextof a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for theexport of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries,in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recentdispute over grain sales to Spain.    If the latest French requests are accepted as expected,this will bring the total of French maize exported in thiscontext to 25,500 tonnes.    The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for thesale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.    Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austriaand Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixedrestitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheatflour were for export to various non-EC countries at anunchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.

CANADA RULING ON U.S. CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK The Canadian government is expectedto announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. cornexports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S.government and farm group representatives said.    The deadline for a final determination is March 7.    U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in asimilar case covering European pasta imports. In that case,Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of theCanadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. cornexports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.    Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. cornimports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts lastmonth because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

U.S. SETS CORN DEFICIENCY PAYMENT HALF PIK CERTS The upcoming five-month deficiencypayments to corn and sorghum farmers will be made half in cashand half in generic commodity certificates, a seniorAgriculture Department official told Reuters.    Around 300 mln dlrs of the in-kind certificates, or"certs," will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16,Tom von Garlem, Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDA's stateand county operations, said.    The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certsratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will bedelayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA's computerprogram, von Garlem said.get 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts incerts and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman).    Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments atsignup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than halfof this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he saidthis will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since mostfarmers got advance payments.    "The final certificate payments will be very close to 300mln dlrs," he said.    When asked if the Office of Management and Budget hadresisted the cash/certs ratio, the USDA official said that "weproposed 50/50 and OMB accepted it." Reuter
SOVIET SOYMEAL IMPORTS SEEN RISING IN 1987 Soviet imports of soymeal may reach orexceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year,the Oil World newsletter said.    Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reducesoybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.    At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from theEuropean Community and South America in the January/Marchquarter, with additional large quantities likely to be importedin the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, itsaid. No figures were given for imports in the correspondingperiods of 1986.    The change made sense in view of the recent purchases ofprobably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseedand large scale butter imports that were expected from Marchonward, it said.    Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grainarea due to recent severe frosts were probably behind therecent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.    It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn hadbeen bought recently by the Soviet Union. Reuter

Woolworth Co, once known only as a five anddime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.    It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases forthe New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 yearsago.    Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrsper share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrsper share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion comparedwith the prior year's 5.96 billion.    For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.    Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters thatincome generated by the company's specialty store operationsaccounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.    He said the company now has 4,700 specialty storesoperating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, itoperated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated byWoolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richmanapparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chainof discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discountdrug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, ofwhich 1,200 are in the United States.    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying asthey are an improvement over last year's record earnings."    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings ineach quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlierperiod.    Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount storeindustry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworthopened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the UnitedStates, although Woolco still operates in Canada.    In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy andannounced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square footthan general merchandise stores.    Reuter

SOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA Despite earlier optimisticindications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stagein its development and recent reports of heat stress couldreduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.

The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows aperiod of severe droughts, which at one point required SouthAfrica to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, itsaid.    Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facingincreased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.

TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST Torrential rains throughoutArgentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarsegrain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.    Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularlyaffected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid tosoybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April orMay.    The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghumcrops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yieldsand cut the total volume of this year's harvest.    Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.    No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.    Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume ofthe coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.    Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central SantaFe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct oftotal planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.    Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest wasestimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two toseven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the1985/86 harvest.    Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according toofficial figures.    The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and ninepct of total planted area.    Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowersfor this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figureof 3.14 mln hectares.    Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mlnand 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the1985/86 harvest.    Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two andfour pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mlnhectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.    Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.    Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit arecord 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figuresput last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.    Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very goodcondition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.    Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest isexpected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares. Reuter
ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC The size of French 1986/87 carryoverbarley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French CerealsIntervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.    He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at theend of February from the previous month while export forecastswere lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.    Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding alarger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets areopened for French barley a large amount could be put intointervention.    A small amount of French barley has already been put intointervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.    The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exportsto non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in1985/86.    The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decisionto hold special export tenders for French maize, he said. Reuter
MORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE Whether the Soviet Union will fulfillits buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreementdepends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade officialtold Reuters.    "How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreementif the United States does not want to offer us grain atcompetitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy traderepresentative of the Soviet Union to the United States.    "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to theUnited States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitiveprices," he said in an interview.    Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up theagreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain atprevailing market prices.    "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said.    Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales ofcommodities under this Agreement will be made at the marketprice prevailing for these products at the time ofpurchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms."    "The United States should supply to the Soviet Uniondefinite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is theUnited States ready to supply this?" he said.    The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand hasbeen met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which heconfirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn pricesremain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.    Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.    "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat,then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to theUnited States to decide how these competitive prices will beoffered," he said.    Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Sovietswas rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer,U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.

USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES  Corn sales gained 2,494,900 tonnes inthe week ended February 26, the highest weekly total sinceAugust 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week'slevel, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department saidsales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reportedunder the daily reporting system -- were the first sales fordelivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSRGrains Supply Agreement, which began October 1.    Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and salesto unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.    Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half fromthe previous week's combined sales, it said.    Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers fordelivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1.    Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled thepreceding week, but were nearly a third below the four weekaverage. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexicoand Italy, it said.    Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct lessthan the four week average.    Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy andAustralia were partially offset by declines to unknowndestinations.

MGE PLANNING APRIL 6 START UP OF HFCS CONTRACT The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE)will start trading futures contracts in high fructose cornsyrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.    Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchangeexpects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It hasbeen under review since the exchange submitted the proposal inDecember, 1985.    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tanktruck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wetmilling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is mostcommonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and otherbeverages.    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from productionfacilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designatedby the symbol "HF," would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Monthstraded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months ofMarch, May, July, September and December.    Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with aminimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuationof one dlr per CWT.    "We hope the producers and users of fructose will beactively involved, those producers being the large processors,the corn wet millers, and the users being the beveragebottlers," Henderson said. "But there are potentials for alltypes of people to use it. There is quite a list of industriesthat utilize fructose." Reuter

U.S. CORN GROWERS BLAST CANADA CORN RULING Canada's ruling in favor of a duty onU.S. corn was a keen disappointment to the National CornGrowers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for othernations to follow, said Mike Hall, lobbyist for theassociation.    "The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now andjust change corn to corn gluten feed" in their complaint, Halltold Reuters.    A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farmpolicies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers andsupported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85cts per bushel.    "This was cleary a political decision," Hall said. "Theamount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant."    The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrumentthat Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices andthat American farm policy has driven down these prices, thuscausing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger governmentpayments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.    Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but thatother nations might also now apply this same argument to attackU.S. farm programs.    The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farmprograms create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hallsaid. The French have long wanted to control the imports ofU.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that theimported feed was unfairly displacing European grain. Reuter

USDA RAISES SOVIET GRAIN IMPORT ESTIMATE The U.S. Agriculture Departmentincreased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes.    In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA saidthe increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to theU.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat andcoarse grain from other major suppliers.    USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up onemln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below thepreliminary 1985/86 figure.    Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mlntonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along witha dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and acold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.    USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightlyfrom the previous January's level, while milk productionincreased by nearly six pct.    Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases inroughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestockproduction from expanding as much as it did a year earlier,USDA said. Reuter

MARKET DISCOUNTS HIGHER SOVIET GRAIN IMPORTS Grain analysts said the increase ofthree mln tonnes in 1986/87 Soviet grain imports is unlikely toaffect the market Tuesday.    They said the market already has discounted higher Sovietimports, partly on news last month that the Soviet Union boughtone mln tonnes of U.S. corn, and on rumors that the Reaganadministration is pushing for authority to sell the SovietsU.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.    In its supply-demand report, the USDA raised its estimatefor 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln.

USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT The Soviet Union will likely honorits commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of fourmln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Departmentofficial said.    "They have always honoured the agreement, and there's noreason now to think they won't this year," he told Reuters.    "They have an aggressive buying campaign from the EuropeanCommunity, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyersfrom all sources at this point," the official said inexplaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain importsestimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.    This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago whenanalysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn forthe first time in 15 years.    A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concernover Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S.corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow'srecent interest.    Lower corn production prospects in some major supplyingcountries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan,and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, theofficial said.    "The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists"and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. "Assoon as they need corn, they'll buy it," he added.    USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to theSoviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said thepurchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.    The USDA official would not speculate on when the Sovietswould enter the U.S. market again.    "There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from thesituation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one offrenetic buying now," the official said.    However, the situation in wheat is "a different story," hesaid. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchasecommitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Sovietpurchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.    Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S.is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer tothe Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation. Reuter
DOLE SAYS 0/92 OPTION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED U.S. Senate Republican leader RobertDole said Congress should consider legislation to apply theso-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities.    Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that hethought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration,"should be seriously considered" because a refusal to do so could"play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls" placedon production.    However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of theirincome support payments regardless of how much they planted.    The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed twoproblems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. Inaddition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farmbill, Dole said.    Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board exportenhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Unioncould help improve U.S. relations with that country.    Dole said that the United States has made the decision totrade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitiveprices.    The senator predicted Congress would have to decide thisyear whether to require an expansion of the export subsidyprogram, which currently targets benefits to recapture marketslost to other suppliers which subsidize.    Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to requirea marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again calledfor the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains.    The Reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes"are not going anywhere" this year, Dole said, singling out theproposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year.    Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed ashift in the State Department towards supporting an exportenhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said hedidn't see any change.    Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senatewhether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year.

In its World Production and Trade Report, the departmentsaid that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline inexportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over theavailability of South African and Chinese corn.    With these corn purchases, Japan is committed to buying 7.7mln tonnes of U.S. corn in 1986/87 (Sept-Aug), nearly 400,000tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date.    South Korea's cumulative commitments amount to 2.5 mlntonnes, up 1.5 mln compared to last year, it said. Reuter
BIG U.S. CONSERVATION ENROLLMENT EXPECTED Enrollment in the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's fourth conservation signup is expected to beannounced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may behigher than total enrollment for the first three signups.    Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres,USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far inthe 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.    Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres intothe program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA'sAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at acongressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will beaccepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.    As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area isexpected to attract the greatest enrollment.    "The Great Plains area will be the predominate area whichwe'll get signup in," a USDA conservation specialist said.    Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of theacreage pulled from that area, he said.    Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreagein the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production,but the USDA source said this would be a relatively smallpercent of the total.    A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll partof their corn base acreage into the program has sparked moreinterest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.    Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to takeland out of production for 10 years. The average rent paymentaccepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre. Reuter
MORE HEAVY RAINS IN ARGENTINE GRAIN AREAS Heavy rains fell again inArgentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday,trade sources said.    Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularlyhigh volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa andSanta Fe provinces.    Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires,heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in LaPampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe.Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.    Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mmin Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm inChaco.    Growers said it was still too early to tell whether therains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflowercrops may have suffered.    Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed bythe bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rainswould have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allowfarm machinery to operate.    The rains caused flooding in western and northwesternBuenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areasthere since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.    Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares,Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said afterflying over the flooded area.    Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said largeparts of the flooded areas were not planted because they arelow-lying and flood easily.    Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by theheavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent ofthe damage. They said it was likely rain combined with highwinds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.    The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and southof Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolatedareas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pcta week ago.    Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop wererevised downward in light of the bad weather.    Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes,down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mlntonnes.    Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a weekago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated aweek ago.    Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes,according to official figures.    Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mlntonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mlntonnes, according to official figures.    Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching betweenfour and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to fourpct a week ago.    Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnesproduced in the last harvest. Reuter
TAIWAN'S FIRST QUARTER MAIZE IMPORTS SEEN RISING Taiwan's maize import commitments areexpected to rise to 970,000 tonnes in the first four months of1987 from 870,000 tonnes a year earlier, a spokesman for theJoint Committee of Maize Importers told Reuters.    He said more than 75 pct of the imports come from the U.S.And the rest from South Africa.

JAPAN FIRM PLANS TO SELL U.S. FARMLAND TO JAPANESE A Japanese real estate companysaid it will launch a campaign to sell land in U.S. Farmingareas to rich Japanese.    Higashi Nippon House said it would offer around 2,200 acresof land in Illinois, California, Florida and Indiana from earlyApril to gauge response. It set up International Farm Corp ofAmerica in Chicago last September to oversee the operation.    American farmers would continue as working tenants and partof the profits from harvests of rice, corn, soybean and orangeswould go to the Japanese investors as rental.    Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials told Reuters saleswere limited to farmers to keep land in agricultural use.    "Two years ago, I began to seek my own farmland in Japan,"said Isao Nakamura, president of Higashi Nippon. "However, saleof Japanese farmland is strictly controlled by the government,so I began to look for the land in the U.S to make my dream toown farm land come true."    Nakamura said hundreds of companies exist in the U.S. Tosell farmland to investors as more and more farmers facedifficulties due to the recession in U.S. Agriculture. REUTER
PORTUGAL GRAIN AGENCY BARRED FROM IMPORT TENDERS A Portuguese court has made apreliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPACshould not be allowed to take part in public import tendersopen to private importers, grain traders and officials said.    Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to theEuropean Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC(Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reducedby 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.    Private traders protested last year that EPAC was beingpermitted to take part in tenders open to them for the firstliberalised 20 pct share of the country's annual import needs.The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legalproceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders.    Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon's civilcourt, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not beallowed to take part in tenders open to private traders.    Trade sources said the ruling, though effectiveimmediately, was subject to appeal and would have to beconfirmed in further proceedings.    A member of the government Cereals Market Commission saidthat, as a result of the court's decision, the Commission wouldnot be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender beingheld today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn.    Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC'sparticipation in the public tenders violated the clauses ofPortugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradualdismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.    It also said the participation of EPAC, which stillcontrols the national grain storage and distribution network,was unfair competition to the private traders.    Traders said they believed the EC's Executive Commissionwas unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring toleave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue.    "They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile," onetrader said.    ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels ifnecessary. Reuter

U.S.-SOVIET GRAIN ACCORD QUESTIONED BY LYNG U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he was not sure a long-term U.S.-Soviet grainagreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.    "It hasn't been worth much in the last two years....Theyhaven't lived up to the agreement as I see it," Lyng said in aninterview with Reuters.    "It would be my thought that it's not worth any effort towork out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement tobe a one-sided thing," he said.    However, Lyng said he did not want to make a "definitivecommitment one way or another at this point."    Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed tobuy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mlntonnes each of corn and wheat.    Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes ofwheat during the third agreement year, which ended lastSeptember, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.    Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscowwould buy this year.    "I've seen people making comments on that and I don't knowhow they know, unless they talk to the Soviets," he said. "I haveno knowledge, and I really don't think anyone other than theSoviets have any knowledge."    Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn lastmonth because "they needed it and because the price was right."    "Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. And I thinkthey've always found that our corn was good," he said. Reuter
GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0/92 FARM PLAN Implementation of a one-year 0/92pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promotedtoday by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommitteeas a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmersanother option when making their planting decisions.    "We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame,but we are locked into this," said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains. "We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt thefarmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both."    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 billfor 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickmansaid that it will probably be introduced next week.    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer toforego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiencypayment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided underthe current bill.    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meetbudget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better thansharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply adifferent type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from governmentpayments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at thispoint, he said.    "I don't think there is any interest in pursuing adecoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal," Glickman saidat the hearing.    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of theBoren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. Hisplan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment toparticipating farmers, require that idled acreage be put toconservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extraidled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acresin a county and provide tenant protection provisions.    "I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, butwe can at least move in that direction," Boschwitz said.    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testifiedin favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current biasin U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'dependency on the government, he said.    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnsonsaid, and would still encourage farmers to plant.    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association andthe National Cattlemen's Association said their groups opposeany 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening thefarm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.    But when asked if his association were forced to choosebetween a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, LarryJohnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

Gulf cash barge basis levels jumped two tothree cents this morning on the rumors, which were expected toboost futures prices on today's open.    The Soviet Union recently bought over 1.0 mln tonnes ofU.S. corn, ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture ahead of tradetalks with U.S. agriculture officials.

USSR HEAVY BUYERS OF YUGOSLAV CORN-U.S. REPORT The Soviet Union has been a heavybuyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a reportfrom the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade.    Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have alreadybeen committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of thissold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Associationreported to the U.S. official.    In a report dated March 10, the official said that about800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balanceof 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June.    An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped fromJuly-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslavcorn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said.    Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslavcorn exports are due to the increased use of river barges forexporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said.    Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averagedaround 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlierestimates of 150,000, the official said.    The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslavcorn sales during this marketing year, he said. Reuter
NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING A greater than anticipated need,competitive prices and political motivations could be sparkingSoviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officialssaid.    As rumors circulated through grain markets today that theSoviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S.corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factorsthat make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely.    First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources saidrecent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain cropbe revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mlnannounced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.    A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affectSoviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said.    Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to theUSSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower itsArgentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mlntonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were alsocut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.    Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of thisyear's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mlntonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR.    "Significant downside potential" still exists for theArgentine crop, the official said, which will decrease theamount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.    "If the Soviet needs are greater than we have beenthinking, then they might need more than what Argentina canprovide during the April to June period," he said.    Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparkedSoviet buying.    U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world marketearlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine cornfor 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Sovietsources said.    "This price difference makes American corn competitive,"Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union,told Reuters.    Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely causethose prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. cornfutures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices havebottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.    Finally, some industry sources said that by buying theminimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grainsagreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping toconvince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat.    In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretaryRichard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheatsubsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out. Reuter
USDA REPORTS 10.572 MLN ACRES IN CONSERVATION The U.S. Agriculture Department hasaccepted 10,572,402 more acres of highly erodable cropland intothe Conservation Reserve Program, USDA announced.    In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submittedbids on a total of 11,254,837 acres.    The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre.    Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will beineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted withpermanent vegetative cover.    Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage inthe conservation program to take advantage of a corn "bonus"rental payment that was offered by USDA.    The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comoditycertificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCSprogram payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn basedaccepted into the reserve.    The state showing the biggest enrollment in theconservation program during this signup was Texas withapproximately 1.225 mln acres, followed by Iowa with 1.030 mlnacres, Minnesota with 890,000 acres, Montana 875,000 acres, andKansas with 842,000 acres.    Other states showing big enrollment were Missouri with646,000 acres, North Dakota with 588,000 acres, and Nebraskawith 554,000 acres.

CBT TRADERS SAY U.S. CONSERVATION SIGNUP NEUTRAL The 11,254,837 acres of highly erodablefarmland submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture forthe conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of10-12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grainand soybean prices Monday, grain traders said.    Farmers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage inthe conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonusrental payment that was offered by the USDA, which may underpinnew crop futures, they said.    New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of alarge sign-up in the program. But traders noted that the pooryielding acres being set-aside will result in only a modestdecrease in final production figures, since farmers willconcentrate on high yielding land.

U.S. CONSERVATION FIGURES SEEN NEUTRAL/BEARISH U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the ConservationReserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutralto bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdownwould be needed to assess the full price impact.    "Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted incorn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what thetrade was looking for," Dale Gustafson of Drexel BurnhamLambert said.    The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres intothe conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837acres.    Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate ofplanted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, butsome other analysts said they would adjust their estimatesslightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentionsfigures March 31.    Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation programrecently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreageto 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.    Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities,said there was not enough information to completely assess theconservation figures. "The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainlydisappointing," he added.    The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of theenrollment figures.    Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative forboth new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean anupward adjustment in planting intention figures.    Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificatesonto the market this spring, he said: "The trade was definitelylooking higher, so certificates are going to be less thanexpected."    The USDA offered a special corn "bonus" rental payment tothe farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonusamounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm programpayment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into thereserve.    Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, saidthe conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she hadexpected, although she noted that some trade expectations wereconsiderably higher than the actual figures.    "I think it is friendly for the market, at least in thelong run," she said.    Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was someconfusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figurebetween 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up orthe latest addition.    "It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bidinto the program," she said.    Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideasabout corn planting figures as a result of the conservationsign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in thehigh 60's.    Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slightreduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate toaround 64 mln acres.    New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmedearlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program,despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally pooryielding and not likely to make a substantial difference tofinal production figures.

TANZANIA WANTS TO EXPORT 200,000 TONNES OF MAIZE Tanzania seeks to export asurplus of 200,000 tonnes of maize from last year's bumperharvest, agriculture minister Paul Bomani said yesterday.

AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92 A 0/92 program would have verylittle impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle onlyan additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, accordingto a report from the Agriculture Department.    The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acresidled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mlndlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.    The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.    "The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause verylarge acreages to be removed from crop production is quitesmall," the report said.    "The returns on typical farms still favor participation inthe usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permittedacreage," the USDA report said.    The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to foregoplanting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,would be most used by producers in high production/high riskareas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,director of USDA's economics analysis staff.    "In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that muchparticipation," Collins said.    USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheatwould be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.    Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushelsof sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales ofcotton, the report said.    "In determining whether to participate, a producer wouldneed to weigh the expected cash costs of production against theloan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above theexpected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must beconsidered," according to the analysis.    "What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference betweenthe loan rate and the cost of production," Collins said.    For producers with low production costs, that difference isgreater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go alongwith 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be moreattractive.    Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would bemore incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.    "I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal atfirst, but it is a step towards the goal of separatingproduction decisions from government payments," Collins said.    In a speech earlier today before the National Grains andFeed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is toolate to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup willbe over by the end of this month.

U.S. COULD COMPLAIN TO GATT ON CANADA CORN DUTY U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter suggested the U.S. could file a formal complaint withthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) challengingCanada's decision to impose duties on U.S. corn imports.    Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply aduty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn shipments, Yeuttersaid the U.S. could file a formal complaint with GATT under thedispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code.    Other U.S. options would be to appeal the decision inCanadian courts, or to retaliate against Canadian goods, alower-level U.S. trade official said. However, retaliation isan unlikely step, at least initially, that official said. Nodecision on U.S. action is expected at least until afterdocuments on the ruling are received here later this week.

USDA DETAILS CONSERVATION CROP ENROLLMENT Farmers enrolled over 6.5 mln acresof program crops in the latest conservation reserve programsignup and around four mln acres of non-program crops,Agriculture Department conservation specialists said.    Soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of thenon-program crop acreage enrolled, a USDA analyst said. Heavyenrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a bigpercentage would be fallow and non-soybean land, accounted fora large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said.    Wheat and corn acreage comprised slightly over 40 pct ofthe total 10,572,402 acres accepted into the ten-year program.    USDA analysts gave the following enrollment breakdown:    -- wheat  2,615,140 acres    -- corn   1,894,764 acres    -- barley   705,888 acres    -- sorghum  585,552 acres    -- cotton   417,893 acres    -- rice       2,035 acres    -- peanuts      611 acres    -- tobacco      285 acres    -- total program crops  6,512,700 acres    -- total nonprogram     4,059,702 acres    -- total enrollment    10,572,402 acres    USDA analysts are currently working on a complete statebreakdown of crop acreage enrollment and should have it readyfor publication later this week, they said.

ZIMBABWE MAIZE OUTPUT TO FALL 65 PCT Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe'sstate-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65pct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agriculturalindustry sources said.    They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline toaround 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year. About 60pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercialfarmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers.    Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveriessince 1980, the sources said there is no danger of a foodshortage in Zimbabwe.    While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000tonnes, the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes,which means that even with the sharply reduced production thisyear Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years.    The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybeandeliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.

U.S. CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING Recent purchases of U.S. corn by theSoviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasingthe price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulfexport point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said.    Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce thecash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which adealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider thannormal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by makingit worthwhile for farmers to move grain.    By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDAcould encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales,where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under thegovernment price support loan program and then marketed.    If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movementwould break the Gulf corn basis.    "The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine countyposted prices," one dealer said. "It should be taking theaverage of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City," whichwould more closely reflect the lower prices in the interiorMidwest.    "But we don't know when they might do it," an Ohio dealersaid, which has created uncertainty in the market.    The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effortto free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited tothe government and remain off the market and in storage.    Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightlymore than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificatesit has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to datebeen exchanged for grain.    With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIKcertificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, theUSDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grainby adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.    A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise inbarge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwestto the export terminals, cash dealers said.    Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risennearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of theoriginal tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening ofthe mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged thefirmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.    The higher transportation costs have served to depressinterior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained bythe elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well asdiscouraging farmer marketings, they said.    "The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,"which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as muchas 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain tradersaid.    But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside,freight rates will settle back down because of the overallsurplus of barges on the Midwest river system. Reuter

"We are not sure how much (Soviets have bought) but we thinkit could be as high as 3.5 mln tonnes," Amstutz told a HouseAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.

ARGENTINE MAIZE, SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL Argentine grain growers reducedtheir estimates for maize and soybean production in the currentharvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.    Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reachbetween 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnesestimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated inmid-February.    But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, accordingto official figures, and would be a new record.    The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was arecord 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pctcompared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.    The change in yield estimates is due to very hightemperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year inthe soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe andnorthern Buenos Aires province.    The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybeanpods empty, especially in Cordoba.    Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, sincerainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.    Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak inBuenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. Therewas no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields wereable to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recentweeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,sunflower and sorghum harvesting.    Crops were considered in generally good condition, thoughit is still too early to judge whether the intense rains ofrecent weeks caused any long-term damage.    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of thetotal area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.    Total production for the current maize harvest is expectedto reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mlntonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pctlower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,according to official figures.    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct oftotal planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was twoto 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.    The current harvest's volume was again expected to bebetween 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower thanlast harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers fearedthat heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll oncrops and, consequently, on total production volume.    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct oftotal planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mlnhectares planted in the previous harvest.    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvestremained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mlntonnes. Reuter

OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED The results of a controversial studyof farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has thehighest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairyfarmers benefit more than any other commodity producers fromsubsidies.    Results of the study, which has not been released by OECDbecause of objections from some countries, were provided toReuters by officials of several countries on condition they notbe identified.    The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies forthe years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producersubsidy equivalent, PSE.    The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE, or theamount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the European Community at 68.8 pctand the United States 48.2 pct.    For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 andthe U.S. 17.2. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.    In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pctcompared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.Japan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the ECand 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.    For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in theEC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.    The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrialcountries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in mostcases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC andJapan, the sources said.    Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developingcountry producers of commodities, were not included in the OECDwork.    Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries torelease the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECDministerial meeting in Paris during May.    Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global tradetalks now underway in Geneva.    British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visitto Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a startingpoint for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.    He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiatedown domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause ofthe present crisis in world agriculture.    However, the OECD study results are controversial becausethey highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officialsfamiliar with the study said.    The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Servicerecently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt toverify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.    In some cases the results were substantially different thanthe OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. andelsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD baseperiod of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.    For example, the USDA study found the United Statessubsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.    French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, toldreporters last week that the United States subsidizes itsfarmers more than the EC.    However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probablyhigher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.    Officials of several countries have been asked tocontribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of thecurrent world farm situation.    The updated calculations, which may take several months tocomplete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictiveimport quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.    U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farmbill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments tograin farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officialsadded. Reuter

EC TO ABOLISH TAX ON SPANISH MAIZE EXPORTS The European Community Commission hasdecided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonneimposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said.    They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC andnon-EC countries alike, would no longer be required on exportsfrom Spanish ports south of Valencia.    The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority'scereals management committee today.    The tax had been introduced last September at the same timeas a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exportsof maize to Spain from other EC member countries.    The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported intoSpain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies frombeing reexported back to them.    The sources added that Spain had received no answer fromthe committee to its request that tenders be opened for thesale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize.    The request will be considered at the committee's nextmeeting, the commission sources said.    Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes ofmaize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-ECproducer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.

U.S. EXPORTERS REPORT 350,000 TONNES CORN  SWITCHED FROM UNKNOWN TO USSR FOR American Express Co's plan to sell astake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be aprelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,analysts said.    American Express earlier said it has a generalunderstanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.    The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,as investors speculated on the possibility of more investmentin the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.    The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response tothe relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents aprice of 2.7 times book value.    Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insidertrading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8times book value.    American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. Forthe last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors ofa spinoff of part of Shearson.    Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit willbenefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasinglyimportant Tokyo financial markets.    "I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step," saidLong.    "What you will see probably in the future is AmericanExpress selling an additional 17 pct in the public market andhave a public vehicle for Shearson," Long said.    "Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitmentinto an illiquid situation," he said of Nippon.    Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake inShearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, likeother investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.    American express has said the total employees of shearsonwill expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, thatnumber is substantially lower than growth last year, a companyspokesman said.    American Express officials would not comment beyond astatement made this morning. That statement, however, did notclose off the possibility of a public offering or other optionfor Shearson.    David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possibleShearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believesthe firm will digest the Nippon investment first.    "I think they'll figure out what they're going to do withthe money they have," he said.    Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also saidAmerican Express could determine to sell shares to the public.    In its statement, the financial services giant said it iscontinuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition tothe investment by Nippon.    American Express said options under study range fromexpanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competitionto broadening its access to capital.    American Express also said the options reflect thecontinuing integral role of Shearson in American Express'worldwide financial services strategy.    Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding aJapanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake toSumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.    Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.    "Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. Theydon't have the money. There's just not enough internal capitalgrowth," said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows otherU.S. brokerage companies.    Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, areinterested in the expertise of American brokers. "Those(Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies havethe capital needs and the growth opportunities to use themoney. That's a nice marriage," he said.

USDA NOT PLANNING ANY MAJOR PRICING CHANGES The Agriculture Department is notconsidering any major changes in its pricing system for postedcounty prices, an Agriculture Department offical said.    "We do not have current plans to make any major adjustmentsor changes in our pricing," said Bob Sindt, USDA assistantdeputy administrator for commodity operations.    U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this weekUSDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium atthe Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS postedprices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement.    But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes.    "If people are suggesting that we are going to makewholesale changes in pricing, we are not considering this," hesaid.    Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity ofimplementing more minor changes in its pricing system.    "We are continually monitoring the whole nationwidestructure to maintain its accuracy," he said. "If we becomeconvinced that we need to make a change, then appropriateadjustments will be made."    Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA'sprice differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interiormarkets are not accurate because of higher than normal bargefreight rates.    He said commodity operations deputy administrator RalphKlopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour andwill meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week.    Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at thatmeeting, including the current concern over the gulf cornpremiums.    He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these pricemargins reflect an average of prices throughout the year andthat seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase ordecrease.    The USDA official also said that only those counties thatuse the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by thehigh barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices.    When asked if the USDA emergency storage program whichallows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge spaceand accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discountedthe idea.    He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges andthat, under provisions of the program, these all have to beemptied by the end of March. Reuter
CONCERN OVER "EL NINO" IN PERU - USDA REPORT There are heightened fears that "ElNino" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continentsand caused widespread damage through floods and drought, theU.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Lima said in a fieldreport.    Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area,flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led toincreased concern, the report, dated March 17, said.    However, it said official sources still believe that thisyear's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.    EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds andwaters in the pacific.    The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now beingexperienced has not had an overall negative impact onagricultural production.    Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduceyields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in thecrop cycle.    Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive whereexcessive moisture exists, it said.    However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supplyof irrigation water in the major dams which will improveprospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, andslow the decline in sugar production, it said.    If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru's fishing industry couldreceive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fishcatch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said.    Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are threeto four degrees centigrade above normal but still not highenough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said.    It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino willintensify and carry on through late March, April and Maycausing problems as crops approach harvest.    "There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino-- only time will tell," the report said. Reuter
ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER The Soviet Union's winter graincrop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry plantingconditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst ofworld weather and crop conditions said.    Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of theEF Hutton publication "Global Crop News," said in her latestreport that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat,from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.    "Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Sovietwinter grain crop) is far more pessimistic," she said. "Butit's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lotwill depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of thetroubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting."    Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probablyprevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheatgrowing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasusreceived on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.    The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke recordlows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken itstoll on Soviet winter crops, she said.    However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt hadample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majorityof crop areas from severe frost damage.    The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grainsin the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily fromCanada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,Martell said.    She cited a number of reasons besides possible cropproblems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.    Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing onmoisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weathernecessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.    Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobylaccident may have contaminated more grain than originallythought and have to be made up with imports.    However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of lastresort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have onlyjust recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.    Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to theUSSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.    In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grainimports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Unionbought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only24 pct of that total.    While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised theirestimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said. Reuter

U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA The U.S. Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal todrastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growersfor the cut with targeted income payments.    In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanyingthe "Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987", Peter Myers,Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administrationwants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginningwith the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.    Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by thegovernment for the price support cut with targeted incomepayments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments wouldcost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.    The administration sugar proposal is expected to beintroduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.John Porter, R-Ill.    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic itis unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate becausepolitically-influential sugar and corn growersand high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and graduallylowers payments over four years. It also excludes from paymentany output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a growerwould receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.    The income payments would be based on the amount ofcommercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changesin the sugar program because the current high price support iscausing adverse trends in the sugar industry.    He said the current program has artificially stimulateddomestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowedcorn sweeteners to make market inroads.    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a"progressive contraction" of the sugar import quota to only onemln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugarrefiners who rely on imported sugar processing.    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program givesoverseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products acompetitive advantage. The result has been higher imports ofsugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processingfacilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost onU.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA saidconsumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more thannecessary for sugar.    "Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap betweensweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverseimpacts and trends which the sugar industry is currentlyfacing," Myers said.    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts perlb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tonsrecoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal tocompensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

DENG SETS LIMIT TO CHINA GRAIN IMPORTS, PAPER SAYS China's top leader Deng Xiaoping saidChina must not import more than 10 mln tonnes of grain, MingPao newspaper of Hong Kong said.    Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 mln tonnes ofgrain in 1986, up from 5.97 mln in 1985 but down from a record16.15 mln in 1982.    The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output isone of several key issues that will influence the wholedevelopment of the economy. It did not give the context of hisremarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln, up from391 mln in 1986.    The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation hasreached the point where "pigs are not fed, there is not enoughgrain and increases in output have slowed."    "We should in our overall economic planning put agriculturein its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes bythe year 2000," he said. "We must avoid the situation in recentyears of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain."    The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council hasdecided to raise the price of five grains, including corn andrice, unchanged since 1978, but it gave no details. REUTER
RAINS PROMISE BOUNTIFUL CROPS IN ETHIOPIA Rain over wide areas has raised theprospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffereda disastrous drought and famine two years ago.    Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's AgricultureDevelopment Department, told reporters prospects were good forattaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the presentgrowing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.    Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnesa year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the "belg"(small) rains which fall at this time of year.    The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops likemaize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affectsproduction in the main rainy season, because farmers eat theirstocks of seed.    Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regionswhich suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sowtheir crops because of the favourable rains.    The government had distributed large quantities of seed andfertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop. Reuter
MARKET LOAN COULD BE PINNED TO U.S. TRADE BILL Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., saidhe was considering amending the Senate Finance Committee'strade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan forsoybeans, corn and wheat.    Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there wasgreat reluctance among members of the Senate AgricultureCommittee to reopen the 1985 farm bill, and that a marketingloan might have a better chance in the Finance panel.    The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which ineffect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at theworld price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in U.S. cottonexports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports.    Pryor serves on both the Senate Finance and AgricultureCommittees. Reuter
PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN OPPOSED BY MINISTER Portugal's Agriculture Minister AlvaroBarreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the stategrain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals importtenders open to private traders.    Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmittedto the tenders.    Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to theEuropean Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC(Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reducedby 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.    Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon'scivil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this monththat EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done,in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.    As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize.    Barreto said, "My objective is put EPAC into the tendersbecause it has a right to take part." He added the governmentwould be studying the court order to see whether or not theruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.    Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator,whether public or private, from the tenders. Private tradershad argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in thePortuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them.    "There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,"Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission hadaccepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible.    The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation inthe public tenders was unfair competition and violated theclauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with thegradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.

U.S. EXPORT INSPECTIONS, IN THOUS BUSHELS  SOYBEANS 13,417 WHEAT 12,003 COR West Germany's banking authoritiesare being drawn into the currency scandal surroundingVolkswagen AG <VOWG.F> as the repercussions and allegations inthe financial community widen, banking sources said.    The Bundesbank has seconded one of its currency experts tohelp the state prosecutor investigating the currency fraud atVolkswagen, VW, in Brunswick, a Bundesbank spokesman said.    The Federal Banking Supervisory Office in West Berlin alsois considering press allegations that several banks "parked" openpositions with VW, breaching banking regulations.    Earlier this month Volkswagen said it had incurredpotential losses of 480 mln marks in an alleged fraud involvingthe hedging of open currency positions.    The foreign exchange activities of a large non-bankcorporation would not normally attract the attention of WestGerman banking regulators.    Their strict foreign exchange rules, set up after theHerstatt banking crash in 1974, apply only to banks.    "This strict banking supervision aims to protect specialinterests -- creditors and depositors," the Bundesbank spokesmansaid, adding company shareholders were not covered.    "The Volkswagen case, in so far as it involves Volkswagen'snormal foreign exchange business, lies far outside the area ofthe Bundesbank," he said.    The Bundesbank's decision to send a currency expert toBrunswick to help investigations into activities involvingVolkswagen's foreign exchange dealing room was part of thenormal assistance rendered by one public authority to another.    The expert will count as part of the state prosecutor'sstaff and not report back to the Bundesbank, he said.    But the Bundesbank could get more closely involved inallegations that banks used VW to circumvent regulations.    Section 1a of the Banking Law requires banks at the closeof business each day to hold no more than 30 pct of theircapital and reserves in open positions.    The section was introduced after the Herstatt bank crash in1974 due to currency speculation.    The Platow Brief financial newsletter said on Friday thatabout 16 banks, mainly foreign, had been circumventing section1a by "parking" such excess open positions with VW.    This would mean that the bank concerned would sell theposition temporarily to VW, buying it back a day or so later.    However, such repurchase agreements are expressly includedin section 1a as still counting as open positions.    A spokesman for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office inWest Berlin said it was following the allegations butinvestigations were difficult because the 16 banks had not beennamed. He declined to say what steps were being taken.    But banking sources said the Supervisory Office as aninitial step had approached the Platow Brief for the identityof the banks, but this had been refused. The Platow Briefdeclined comment.    If the Supervisory Office ascertains that the bankingregulations have been infringed, it will pursue the case withthe assistance of the Bundesbank.    The Office, subordinate to the Finance Ministry, does nothave branches outside Berlin.    The independent Bundesbank however operates 203 branches inWest Germany, closely monitoring local banks.    Banks deposit statistics, including currency position data,once a month with the Bundesbank's regional administrations atfederal state level, the Landeszentralbanken (LZBs).    Currency dealers said parking excess positions withnon-banking corporates was frequent practice.    Such positions would often be sold for tomorrow/nextdelivery, with a verbal agreement to buy it back the next dayat the same rate.    A VW spokesman said it was company policy not to undertakecurrency hedging but he confirmed that arbitrage was allowed.    He declined to estimate the volume of currency arbitraging.German press reports have put it at 80 billion marks a year.    The spokesman declined to comment on how it would have beenpossible to carry out a fraud involving currency hedging giventhe company's policy not to conduct this kind of business.    VW finance director Rolf Selowsky accepted responsibilityand resigned. VW has suspended six other officials and firedits former foreign exchange chief, Burkhard "Bobby" Junger.    Management board chief Carl Hahn told a ceremony todaymarking VW's 50 millionth vehicle that personnel changes didnot mean any of those involved was guilty. REUTER
EC COMMISSION SET TO DETAIL GRAIN IMPORT PLAN The EC Commission will decide shortlyprecisely how to arrange the import of third country maize andsorghum into the EC in fulfilment of its agreement with theUnited States, Commission sources said.    Under the accord, reached following U.S. complaints aboutthe impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish ECmembership, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990.    All this produce will be imported into Spain at speciallevy levels likely to be below those applying for imports intoother EC countries.    The sources said it was possible that the Spanishintervention board would be asked to buy the produce directlythis year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.    They added that the choice for future years appears to liebetween a system of regular tenders and the setting of a dailyspecial levy applicable to Spanish imports.    There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize andsorghum from Spain to other EC countries, although such a taxcould be imposed later, the sources added. Reuter
HEAVY SIGNUP SEEN IN 1987 CORN PROGRAM - USDA With less than a week remaining toenroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, Agriculture Departmentofficials said that final signup will probably exceed lastyear's level of 85 pct.    Enrollment in USDA's basic acreage reduction program willlikely total close to 90 pct, Agricultural Stabilization andConservation Service, ASCS, officials said, with 50 to 70 pctof the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paidland diversion program.    The signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officiallyends at the close of the business day on March 30.    USDA will release its official signup report around April15, an official said.    USDA personnel in the corn belt states of Iowa, Illinois,and Indiana have been reporting heavy signup activity, an ASCSofficial told Reuters.    A surge of acitivity is expected during this final week ofsignup, the official said.    "A lot of farmers have been dragging their feet becausethey were anticipating some changes in the program, but thatdoesn't look very likely now," he said.    To enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, farmers have toset aside 20 pct of the program acreage base, and have theoption to idle an additional 15 pct under a paid land diversionprogram. Reuter

U.S. CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW U.S. corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassedacreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as oneof the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixtyyears, Agriculture Department officials said.    USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures willlikely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.    Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. cornproduction will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987corn production could drop by over one billion bushels toaround seven billion bushels.    Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grainsprogram, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservationprogram, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrainanalysts said.    "There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease incorn acreage," one said. "It's difficult for any farmer to notgo along with the program this year."    Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year butat a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.    Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, theysaid, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.    If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then thedrop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 whenfarmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.    Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. Asevere drought that summer in major producing states causedyields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2billion bushels.    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analystssaid the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billionbushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.    "This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significantreduction in production," an analyst said.    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would notincrease significantly, a specialist said.    High producing corn belt states are expected to show thegreatest acreage reductions, based upon historicalparticipation in government programs, analysts said.    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the mostin marginal producing areas of the southeast and the westerncorn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.    "Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,"he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts inhigher-producing delta areas.    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, hassteadily declined in the 1980's.    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been inthe low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. Thehighest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA haskept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mlnacres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yieldsaveraging 119.3 bushels per acre.    "We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billionbushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so," an analyst said.    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres aslong as government program provisions remain the same, analystssaid.    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required toset aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligiblefor payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15pct of their acreage.    "To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have toprovide more incentives," an analyst said. Reuter

ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER Argentine grain producers againreduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April,trade sources said.    They said growers now forecast soybean production thisseason at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week'sestimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mlntonnes forecast in mid-February.    The new forecast is still higher than last season's recordtotal production.    Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecastfor the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.    Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean podsin the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Feprovinces and northern Buenos Aires.    The crop since January has been hit by high temperaturesand inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more emptypods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86record of 3.34 mln hectares.    The state of the crop continued to be good in general untillast week but intense, heavy rains since could have causeddamage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.    Where the rains were less heavy they were consideredbeneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops insouthern Buenos Aires province but are not expected toinfluence production forecasts.    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, whererainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maizeand sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week byrains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, LaPampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mlnhectares in 1985/86.    The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast atbetween 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 productionand 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of thearea sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Airesalthough at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage isimpossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days ofsunshine dries the fields.    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.    Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln tonnes.    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by therains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and startingin La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes. Reuter
COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS Congress, eager to find budgetsavings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department'sgeneric commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDAand the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over howmuch the program has cost U.S. taxpayers.    The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week thatpayment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who askednot to be identified said.    USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, sayingit did not take into account storage, handling and transportsavings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided tore-examine the costs, sources said.    The issue is an important one, because congressional budgetcommittees are known to be considering limiting the use ofcertificates as a means of cutting spending.    Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO SeniorAssociate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before theSenate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.    Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there areuncertainties in determining the cost of certificates comparedto cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.    USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 centsto store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put ingovernment storage.    It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigativearm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs thegovernment more to use certificates instead of cash in farmprice and income support programs, Reagan administrationsources said.    The GAO is expected to point out that use ofpayment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tightstorage by moving grain that otherwise might not have beensold.    The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate DirectorBrian Crowley comes as congressional budget committeesintensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federalbudget deficit -- including considering limits on the use ofPIK certificates.    The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, orcerts, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays tofarmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used torepay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities orcash.    Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billiondlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January andAugust 1987, according to USDA.    Certs can cost the government more than cash primarilybecause recipients can use the certificates to pay backgovernment loans at levels below the loan rate.    Eliminating this practice, called "PIK and roll," would savethe government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according tothe Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, accordingto a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificatescost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.    The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to beconsidering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among othersavings alternatives.    The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that theestimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to datehave cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mlndlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, oneadministration official said.    However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimatesbased in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.    The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributableto the different effect certificates can have on market pricesover the course of a crop year.    USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has foundthat between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels ofcorn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn bybetween 35 and 45 cents per bushel.    Between September and November, however, certificates hadonly a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERSstudy, obtained by Reuters. Reuter

LOWER ASCS CORN PRICES TO AFFECT TEN STATES The Agriculture Department'swidening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect countyposted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states, a USDAofficial said.    All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will countieswhich use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana,Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabamaand Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of CommodityOperations Division for the USDA.    USDA last night notified the grain industry that effectiveimmediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior cornwould be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts,depending on what the differential is.    USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high postedcounty prices for corn caused by high gulf prices.    "We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for amonth, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in anynearby time," Burgess said.    Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulfdifferentials when and if Gulf prices recede. "If we're off themark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off themark if we're too low?" he said.    While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall,Burgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are beingplanned right now.    "We don't tinker. We don't make changes lightly, and wedon't make changes often," he said. Reuter

WEATHER HURTING YUGOSLAV WHEAT - USDA REPORT Unfavorable late winter weatherconditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslaviaindicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop,the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said.    The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade toSubotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crophad been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spellthat followed a period of warm weather.    He said unseasonably warm weather in late February thatbrought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early wasfollowed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.    Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of whichshow stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leafand possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.    The report said that since much of the early growth inFebruary was from late seeding rather than from normaldevelopment, his view was that the damage may be more extensivethan some local observers say.    The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fieldson normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin andchances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.    However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorableand many of the fields had already been top-dressed, whichwould aid recovery. Reuter

GRAIN REPORTS IMPROVE U.S. FARM OUTLOOK-ANALYSTS The U.S. grain planting intentions andstocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, agrain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.    The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocksare "the first report we've had for a long time that shows anyoptimism for anybody," said John "Bud" Frazier, grain analystand executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.    "I'm really excited about it," Frazier said.    The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend toplant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted lastyear, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.    The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels ofsoybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushelsof wheat, all below trade guesses.    Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analystwith AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst withShearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Tradepanel to discuss the reports.    Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendlyfor the market, and soybean prices would jump three to fivecents a bushel "if the bell rang right now."    "We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn andsoybeans) than we thought we had," he said, noting that hog andpoultry production is up.    "We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,"said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and15 pct in the preceding quarter.    However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceedconsumption.    She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres camein southeastern states, where yields are usually low.    "We have the potential for record breaking soybean yieldsthis year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow'sopening," she said.    Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and thecrop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down fromlast year's 8.25 billion bushels.    "We'll need very good disappearance next year to reducestocks," she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last yearat 6.7 billion bushels.    Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the longterm, "But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks downto where we could start rebuilding prices."    Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage reportcould prompt farmers to change their plans and plant moresoybeans.    The panelists agreed that the reports should discouragetalk of revising the 1985 farm bill.    "There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm lawwe're working under today, and this report should reinforcethat," Frazier said.    "We are seeing the program beginning to work," said Meyer.

CHINA OFFICIAL CONDEMNS GOVERNMENT GRAIN POLICY The grain output of a major Chinesegrain-producing province is not increasing, because farmerslack incentives, production costs are rising, storagefacilities are poor and there is not enough state investment ingrain, the province's vice-governor said.    The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui,as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton asthey could growing grain, and three times as much growing cashcrops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pctof farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investmenthad caused the area of irrigated land to fall.    Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pctof the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.    He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain washit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and afurther 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.    He said government measures to deal with the problem dealtwith trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for moreinvestment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal useof or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called thetendency to rely on grain imports.    The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate tothe National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He saidthe government had cut agricultural investment to three to fourpct from 11 pct.    "With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past fewyears, some people got carried away, relaxing their attentionto grain and cotton production," he said.    On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to beself-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from thenortheast, but it imports wheat.    "Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reachthe 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be consideredadequate," Tian said. REUTER

MIDWEST CASH GRAIN - SLOW COUNTRY MOVEMENT Cash grain dealers reported slow countrymovement of corn and soybeans across the Midwest, with evencorn sales from PIK-and-roll activity seen earlier this weekdrying up.    Some dealers said the USDA may further adjust the postedcounty price at the Gulf to take into account high bargefreight rates as a way to keep corn sales flowing, but addedthe current plan probably will be given a few weeks to see ifit will work as hoped.    Corn and soybean basis values continued to drop on theIllinois and MidMississippi River due to the strong bargefreight rates. Toledo and Chicago elevators were finishingloading the first corn boats of the new shipping season,supporting spot basis values at those terminal points.

FRENCH FARMERS PLAN TO CUT MAIZE PLANTINGS French farmers are planning to cut theirmaize sowings by between 100,000 and 150,000 hectares this yearfrom the 1.87 mln ha harvested in 1986, the French MaizeProducers' Association, AGPM, said.    It said its first estimate of planting intentions indicatedcuts of 15 to 20 pct in plantings in the northern region ofPicardy and the Paris Basin, which harvested 192,000 ha lastyear.    In the centre-west region of Poitou-Charentes, plantingswere estimated four to seven pct up on last year's harvested244,000 ha.    Planting intentions in the south-east ranged between ninepct less and two pct more than last year's 125,000 ha. In thesouth-west the AGPM said producers intended to plant a similararea to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided watersupplies are adequate in the Midi-Pyrenees region after thelast two years of drought.    Meanwhile, the oilseed plant breeding association, AMSOL,said sunflower plantings in France this year are indicated atbetween 900,000 and 950,000 ha against 829,000 harvested lastyear, while soya plantings are indicated at 80,000 ha againstlast year's harvested 48,000.

SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER Speculation the United States willoffer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to havereached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary ofState George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheatmarkets since officials from the two countries held theircustomary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow'sdecision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn marketstrengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand inthe way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export EnhancementProgram, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit toMoscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representativeshere as a clear signal that the Reagan administration waspreparing an offer.    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lippedabout the prospects of a subsidy offer.    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned thecontention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,while not a "done deal," is a live possibility.    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whomasked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that anoffer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,are saying they would not rule one out.    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as topredict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten daysto two weeks.    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaderswho had been in contact with administration officials.    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancementoffer would be made by the middle of this month.    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would endup being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier thisyear when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrsper tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheatsubsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases ofU.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat dealwould appear to be price.    Last summer the administration took the controversial stepof offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but wereembarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the groundsthat the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat pricesfar above world market prices.    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level upfront instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be ameans of controlling the price while attempting to dampencriticism, grain trade sources said.    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultzfrom saying the Soviets were "chortling" because Washington wasoffering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available toU.S. housewives.    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representativeshere is that a general warming of relations between the twocountries since last summer, combined with continued hard timesin the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would considerbuying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstancessurrounding the administration's announcement of the wheatsubsidy offer last summer.    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional andindustry leaders were led to believe the White House haddecided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include notonly the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer toinclude only the Soviets.    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure ofuncertainty even to the predictions of those most convincedthat the administration will not now pass up the opportunity tosell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

U.S. SAID PROMISED BULK OF MAIZE EXPORT TO SPAIN The U.S. Has been promised a nearmonopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countriesguaranteed under an agreement with the European Community, anEC official said.    The official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters thatthe guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of theagreement.    Under the accord, which began in January, third countrieswere guaranteed access for the next four years for two mlntonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market, as well as300,000 tonnes of sorghum.    However, the official said the U.S. Had been assured thatalmost all the exports would be reserved for its traders.    The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either atender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or toauthorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board.    EC sources noted that under a tender system maize fromoutside the U.S. Would sometimes be offered on more favourableterms than that from the U.S.    No Commission spokesman was immediately available forcomment.

ARGENTINE CORN SALES TO USSR LOWER - USDA REPORT Total corn sales by Argentina to theSoviet Union are only 1.5 to 1.8 mln tonnes, with deliveryspread out from March to June, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's Counselor in Buenos Aires said in a field report.    The report, dated March 27, said many sources have statedthat the Soviet Union was initially interested in purchasing2.3 mln tonnes lof corn from Argentina.    However, Soviet purchases from the United States havetended to displace additional Argentine purchases, the reportsaid.    The USDA has to date reported USSR purchases of 2.6 mlntonnes of U.S. corn for delivery in the current U.S.-USSR grainagreement year, which ends this September 30, it said. Reuter
HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP Fresh, heavy rains caused furtherdamage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the weekto yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, tradesources said.    They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum cropswere damaged and yield estimates affected. New productionforecasts were made for all these crops.    The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registeredmore than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires andworsened the flooding in various parts of the province.    The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aireshave surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.    The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.    In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres areabordering on Uruguay.    In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mmin places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.    The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.    Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also befurther delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.    The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of thecrops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.    Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa andBuenos Aires provinces.    The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has beenlowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lowerthan the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.    The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.    The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of thearea sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Itwill begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weatherpermitting.    Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mlntonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which privateproducers put 1985/86 production.    The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the officialfigure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production.    The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers'targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.    The production forecast was reduced to between three and3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.    The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mlnhectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.    The forecast for soybean yield this season was the leastchanged in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.    These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season'srecord of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources,and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.    The adjustment to the production forecast is due to therains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced thesunlight needed for this crop, sources said.    Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted downfurther.    The humidity could induce rotting and growers are stillfinding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlierin the season.    Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southernCordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Reuter
STRONG DEMAND FOR U.S. CORN IN JAPAN -- USDA Japan appears to be relying less oncorn from China, Argentina and South Africa and more onsupplies from the United States, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment said.    In its World Production and Trade report, the departmentsaid in the past seven weeks reported U.S. corn sales of nearlythree mln tonnes to Japan are about three times the levelduring this period last year.    Reports of short Argentine supplies and the apparentunwillingness of the Chinese to sell at current world pricesmay have caused Japanese buyers to turn to the United Statesfor corn supplies, the department said.

FRENCH SUBSIDIZED CORN FOR TUNISIA/MOROCCO-USDA U.S. corn sales to Tunisia, Moroccoand other North African countries may face increasedcompetition from European Community (EC) corn sales, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In its World Production and Trade report, the USDA saidsales of French corn for nearby delivery have been confirmedwith an export subsidy of about 145 dlrs per tonne, bringingthe French price to about 72 dlrs per tonne, FOB.    While this is about the same price as U.S. corn, EC cornhas lower transport costs, the department noted.    The French sales mark the beginning of commercial EC cornexports which could reach 750,000 tonnes to North Africa andthe Middle East, areas which have traditionally purchased theircorn needs from the United States, the department said.    Department officials said the 750,000 tonnes of exports arefor the year up to September 30 1987.    They said export licenses for about 500,000 tonnes havebeen issued so far. Reuter
EC DENIES MAIZE EXPORTS RESERVED FOR U.S. The agreement between the U.S. And theEuropean Community (EC) on special imports of maize and sorghumprovides an equal chance for all non-EC countries to supply theSpanish market, an EC Commission spokeswoman said.    She denied that any unpublished clause of the agreementguaranteed the bulk of the maize export business would go tothe U.S., As one EC official told Reuters yesterday.    Under the agreement, the EC will import two mln tonnes ofmaize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year into Spain atspecially reduced levy rates for the next four years.

U.S. ACREAGE CUTS SEEN LIMITING STOCK BUILD Sharp cuts this year in U.S. plantedacreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile butwill at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, AgricultureDepartment and industry commodity analysts said.    "The scenario is turning around on stocks. The wholesupply/demand picture could finally be getting more inbalance," a USDA analyst said.    The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicatedthat U.S. farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annualacreage reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mlnacres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program,bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres,almost a third of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base.    Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 willprobably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup instocks, analysts said.    "It's a substantially different story from last year whenwe added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile," VernonMcMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said.    Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here,McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likelytranslate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields,final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels.    McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resultingin a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpileof 5.45 billion bushels.    "To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we'reat least in a holding pattern," George Hoffman, director ofcommodity analysis for Pillsbury said.    Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to "significantly less"domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices.    USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage andsaid wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least notincrease. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, nextyear's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said.    "We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now,so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreagereductions, that would be an improvement," an AgricultureDepartment wheat analyst said.    Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be thesmallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lowerfinal production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to100 mln bushels, analysts said.    As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in theconservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programswill be more effective because they will force more highproducing land out of production, a USDA analyst said.    "We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very longtunnel," the analyst said. Reuter

PIK-AND-ROLL PRESSURES CORN BASIS VALUES Changes by the USDA in its posted countyprices have successfully increased PIK-and-roll activity as away to pull corn out of government stockpiles, with theresulting jump in free supplies pressuring terminal corn basisvalues, cash grain dealers said.    Processors dropped spot Chicago corn basis bids three centsafter covering most of the April needs this week, with rivercorn basis bids following CIF Gulf corn values lower.    The surge in PIK-and-roll also pressured corn futures, withMay settling today down three cents per bushel at 1.58-1/2dlrs, near the contract low of 1.49-1/4 dlrs. But unlike in thepast when lower prices slowed country movement, now lowercounty prices widen the differentials with the corn loan andmake PIK-and-roll even more attractive, they noted. Reuter

THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion ayear ago, the Business Economics Department said.    It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion bahtfrom 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate thisyear resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materialsand semi-finished products.    The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in thefirst quarter due to lower oil prices.    The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6billion baht from 56.6 billion.    Export growth was smaller than expected due to lowerearnings from many key commodities including rice whoseearnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26pct and canned pineapples seven pct.    Products registering high export growth were jewellery up64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct. REUTER
JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S. Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market," he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table," the officialsaid. REUTER
ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE The Zambian government has no immediateplans to follow last week's increase in the producer price ofmaize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, anofficial of the ruling party said.    Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price forrefined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots inwhich at least 15 people died.    That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda laterrevoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund(IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.    However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail priceincrease, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,a practice discouraged by the IMF.    "There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels ofmeal. It (the government) would have to choose between thedemands of the IMF and those of the people," a Ministry ofAgriculture economist said.

FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, whichwill be sown between May and August or September, has so farnot been as intense as in previous years. Reuter
BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS Storage problems with Brazil's recordgrain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mlntonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of thisyear's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable inharvesting, but that most of it would stem from storageproblems.    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,theoretically sufficient for the crop.    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badlydistributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande doSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but wereresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-Westgrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storagecapacity.    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya andmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grainsproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared tostoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable forstoring loose grain, Brito said.    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport thecrops.    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crophas been evident from television reports, which have shownenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries. Reuter
SOUTH KOREA CORN IMPORTS MAY INCREASE - USDA South Korea's purchase of about 2.4mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close todouble last year's total -- indicates that imports from theUnited States, as well as total imports are set for a dramaticjump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In its World Production and Trade Report, the departmentsaid total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season(Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mlntonnes from the United States.    During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mlntonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.    Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn inlight of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies fromChina, Argentina and South Africa, it said. Reuter

BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT Based on field travel in theBrazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be aboutaverage or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.    It said generally favorable weather from early Decemberthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness.    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 daysfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the secondweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeanswhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, thereport said.    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will createserious storage problems, the report said.    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased bymore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields areexpected to be above average, it said.    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn cropcrop has been harvested.    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grainelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, thereport said.    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Paranaaccounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasonsfor the decline are expected reduced government support priceand good summer crop harvests. Reuter
EC COMMISSION AUTHORISED TO BUY MAIZE IN JUNE The European Commission was authorisedto buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention storesin the second half of June, although sales into interventionnormally end on April 30, Commission sources said.    They said approval was given by the EC's Cereals ManagementCommittee because of the possible disturbance of the market dueto heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the ECand the United States.    The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market fortwo mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years.

DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS A prolonged dry spell has damaged111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provincesin the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officialssaid.    They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produceestimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack ofrainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailingconditions continued until next month.    Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped thelosses would be offset by the expected increase in output inother, normally more productive areas not affected by the dryspell.    Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.    About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.    Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has beenhit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national totalthus the damage is considered negligible.    In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled byproduction from non-traditional corn farms which diversifiedinto the cash crop from sugar two years ago.     The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut productionin the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were noreports of actual damage.

CHINA RAISES GRAIN PURCHASE PRICES China has raised the state purchaseprices of corn, rice, cottonseed and shelled peanuts from April1 to encourage farmers to grow them, the official ChinaCommercial Daily said.    The paper said the price paid for corn from 14 northernprovinces, cities and regions has increased by one yuan per 50kg. A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take theprice to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.    The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10southern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.    The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwestChina has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave nomore price details.    It said local authorities must inform farmers of the priceincreases before farmers begin planting, to encourageproduction of grains and oilseeds.

60,000 TONNES CORN SMUGGLED INTO PHILIPPINES-PAPER At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the pastfew months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting anofficial in the National Food Authority (NFA).    The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortageand corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel havejeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which wasaimed at saving foreign currency.    The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan assaying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnesagainst a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.    Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of cornworth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.

EC TO OFFER ARGENTINA GRAIN SALE COMPENSATION The European Community is to offerArgentina compensation for its loss of maize and sorghumexports to Spain following Spain's accession to the EC, ECsources said.    They said the offer will be made next week in Geneva,headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT), and will also involve products other than cereals. Theygave no further details.    Argentine exports of sorghum to Spain fell to zero lastyear from 300,000 tonnes in 1985, while maize sales fell to15,000 tonnes from 994,000, official EC statistics show.    The sources noted that an agreement between the EC and theU.S. guarantees special access to the Spanish market for twomln tonnes of non-EC maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum eachyear for the next four years.    But they said various details of this accord will tend toinhibit imports from Argentina.    These include a provision for reduction of the amounts ifSpain imports cereals substitutes, and the EC's plan to importthe special maize and sorghum on a regular monthly basis.Argentina tends to have exportable quantities only three orfour times a year.

USDA ADJUSTS LOUISIANA GULF PRICE DIFFERENTIALS The U.S. Agriculture Department hasnarrowed by three cents the price differential between theLouisiana Gulf price of corn and posted country prices peggedto the gulf price, USDA officials said.    The change, effective April 27, means posted county priceswill be three cents higher in the region, Robert Sindt,assistant deputy administrator of USDA's AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service, said.    Trade sources said USDA adjusted the differentials becausegulf prices had shown some weakness in recent days comparedwith the rest of the country.    Sindt said Louisiana Gulf corn price differentials that hadbeen between four and eight cents would, effective Monday,range between one and five cents.    Trade sources said cash bids at the Louisiana Gulf havebeen between three and 4.5 cents weaker than in the rest of thecountry in recent days, and that USDA's move would strengthenthe front end of the corn market.

SEOUL UNVEILS SHOPPING LIST OF U.S. GOODS South Korea unveiled a shopping list of2.6 billion dlrs of U.S. Goods in line with its new policy ofseeking to limiting its trade surplus to ease trade frictionwith Washington.    The government said this would help freeze this year'strade surplus with the United States at the 1986 level.    "The surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dollars last yearfrom 4.3 billion in 1985, was projected to top 10 billion thisyear but the government has taken steps to constrain it to theseven billion dollar level," one Trade Ministry official toldReuters.    A government statement said the 2.6 billion dlrs was inaddition to about two billion dlrs of purchases made last monthby a South Korean trade mission to the United States.    The announcement follows a visit here this week by U.S.Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who said that if SouthKorea wanted to avoid protectionist retaliation it should notfalter in its policies to open its market and cut its surplus.    The statement said the government, state agencies and otherpublic institutions would buy 480 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Cars,computers, helicopters, ambulances, motorcycles, medical andlaboratory equipment and other products. "This amounts includes89 mln dlrs worth of purchases which were not originallyreflected in their budgets," it added.    The list includes 1.13 billion dlrs of capital goods, 700mln of farm products, 50 mln of aluminium, zinc, polyethyleneand other raw materials, and 250 mln of steel, electronics andshipbuilding parts which would be shifted from other nations.    Agriculture Ministry officials said South Korea had alreadybought 310 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Wheat, raw cotton, corn andsoybeans.    This meant the country would buy from the United Statesnearly all of the 1.27 billion dlrs of its planned imports ofsuch commodities this year, they said.    The government will also take steps to reduce tariffs,accelerate the opening of its markets, voluntarily restrainexports and cut export financing, the statement said.    South Korea will also reorganise the country's 3,600 tradeagents to deliver better after-sales services for importedproducts and hold a trade show in November for U.S. Products. Reuter

SOVIET SPRING CROPS SOWN ON ONLY 11 PCT OF LAND Soviet farmers had sown spring cropson only 15.8 mln hectares or 11 pct of cultivated land by April27, compared with 26.2 mln ha by April 21, 1986, Izvestia said.    Grains and pulses (except maize) were sown on 6.7 mln ha,compared with 13.1 mln at the same time last year, it added.    Spring sowing is off to a slow start, with planting two tofour weeks behind schedule in many areas of the Ukraine,Byelorussia and Russia, because the winter was unusually cold.

FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE The U.S. Department of Agriculture'sforecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks willalmost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not besurprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.    The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'Association and the National Union of Agricultural and CerealCooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports orend-of-season stocks.    However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mlnwas not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.    The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecastin mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare forsoft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 andthe record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.    This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry ofAgriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectaresagainst 4.61 mln in 1986/87.    ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaignwill be released at the beginning of September, an ONICofficial said.    Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult toestimate at this stage, both within the European Community andto non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.    He said, however, that among countries to which Francecould increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghrebcountries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.    The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,was not out of line with estimates of the French MaizeProducers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.    Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields wereexpected to be higher, the AGPM official said.    It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87. Reuter
ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT The Zambian government today announcedminor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its neweconomic strategy, while police and troops patrolled thenorthern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.    However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,were not affected by the cuts and many people said this couldprovoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected moresweeping reductions.    Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with thesmall extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct onitems such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.    Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone saidgovernment forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.    In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no signof troops or police reinforcements on the streets.    President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to takeaccount of lower import costs following the revaluation of thekwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.    The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economicstrategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerityprogram.    Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs ofunemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatileregion to take action against shops that did not reduce theirprices after today's deadline.

U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO SPEED UP CORN PAYMENTS The House Agriculture Committee votedto make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiencypayments immediately instead of in the late fall.    A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senatefloor last week.    The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allowso-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather thanlate this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would notbe changed.    Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spendinginto fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected tomeet stiff resistance in the full House. Reuter
NO YIELD DAMAGE YET IN U.S. CORN, BEANS - USDA The U.S. corn and soybean crops arein mostly good condition and have not suffered any yielddeterioration from recent hot, dry weather, AgricultureDepartment and private weather and crop analysts said.    "I don't see any reduction in yield potential yet," NortonStrommen, chief meteorologist at USDA told Reuters. "The (cornand soybean) crop is actually in mostly good condition and isprogressing ahead of normal, which is good," he said.    Abnormally hot, dry weather in midwestern crop areassparked a sharp rally in Chicago futures today, causing newcrop soybeans to advance the 30 cent daily limit to 6.14 dlrsper bushel and September corn to go up 12 cents to 2.81 dlrs.    "This rally is amazing," a private crop analyst said. "Corn,soybeans and wheat are in excellent condition."    The USDA meteorologist said the only effects of the warm,dy weather on crops so far has probably been to speed updevelopment of the crop, which will help the crop better copewith stress later in its more critical growing period.    "What this weather will do is simply push the crop towardsrapid development of a good, deep root system to draw on thesubsoil reserve. It actually strengthens the crop to go througha little stress early on," Strommen said.    Strommen noted that subsoil moisture is in good shape inmost growing areas.    Strommen and other private crop analysts noted corn andsoybeans will not enter their critical growth stages until Julyand August.    But because of its early development this year, Strommensaid the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproductionperiod by the first of July.    "Weatherwise, if the market is truly concerned about corn orsoybeans, it should be more concerned about corn. But thedryness still has to last for another two to three weeks," ananalyst said.    Soybeans, on the other hand, can withstand several moreweeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating, cropanalysts agreed.    August and September are the critical yield-producingmonths for soybeans, Strommen said.    "The sole purpose of the soybean plant is to simply surviveduring May, June and July until the August rains whichdetermine the crop," a crop analyst said.    Some analysts contend, however, that in certain growingareas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensurethat there will not be problems later.    Strommen noted the USDA's current six to 10 day weatherforecast calls for above normal temperatures and below normalprecipitation in much of the corn belt.    "This opens up all sorts of speculation," he said. Reuter
HOT WEATHER PUSHES CBT GRAINS TO NEW HIGHS Hot, dry weather over the Midwest, withmore forecast, pushed grain futures prices to new highs todayon the Chicago Board of Trade.    Soybean futures led the advance, closing up the30-cent-per-bushel daily trading limit in contracts fordelivery after this year's fall harvest. All months setlife-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs abushel.    "The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter thannormal for some time out," said David Bartholomew, assistantvice president for Merrill Lynch. "We have probably gone ashigh as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how tomeasure the euphoria level."    Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week,posted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limitin new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs.    Corn futures set contract highs in March through September,with December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4dlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improvedharvest conditions in the southern Midwest.    The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybeanplants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefityoung plants by encouraging the development of deep rootsystems, Bartholomew said.    European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed toactive buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybeanorders went unfilled at the close, traders said.    After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)meteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have notsuffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather.    Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of thedollar, which can depress prices by making grains moreexpensive for foreign buyers.    But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York'sCOMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settlesteady.    Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that theweather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears ofinflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures,which closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S.trade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices.    A USDA report released after trading said the number ofcattle being fed in seven major producing states was abovelevels expected by traders. Traders said the report wouldprobably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the ChicagoMercantile Exchange.    USDA put cattle-on-feed in the seven major states at 7.52mln head, 106 pct of a year ago and at the high end of tradeforecasts.    A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May,up 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said.    Cattle futures closed mixed in choppy trading today as hotweather slowed consumer demand for red meat, traders said. Reuter
JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pctto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pctfrom 2.1 pct. REUTER
BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS U.S. House and Senate budgetnegotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reachedyesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spendingon agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.    The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.    The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from thefarm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for atotal of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.    The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculturecommittees with difficult choices on how to make changes inagriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targetswithout jeopardizing popular support payments, seniorCongressional aides told Reuters.    Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to findthe budget savings.    Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grainssubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheatand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrsand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza hassaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely tobe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers anda strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who saidfreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other majorgrain export competitors and would not achieve the budgetsavings Glickman claims.    Another area where Glickman and other have said budgetsavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,ARP, levels for wheat and corn.    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong standwithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 cropwheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Mostcommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.    Congressional sources said the only way to achievesignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boostthe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source saidsingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen asunfair to one commodity.    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is mostlikely to eventually look for budget savings are sometightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billionbut not enough, they said.    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculturecommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut onall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including pricesupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to theGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm BureauFederation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities. Reuter

GHANA LIFTS RICE/MAIZE IMPORT BAN DUE TO DROUGHT Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maizeimports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.    Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchweymade the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnesof rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aidprogramme.    The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, followsgovernment concern over "lower than average rainfall in southernGhana and its implications for the major harvest."    Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growingareas throughout the south this year. The Ministry ofAgriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in allmajor staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.    GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequencesof current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the droughtexperiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps toalleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.    The failure of seasonal rains has already seriouslyaffected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in partsof the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers havedried up. Reuter
RAINS HELP U.S. WESTERN CORN BELT, MORE SEEN Weekend rain over the Western Corn Beltbrought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlierthis month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcomemoisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-WeatherInc.    "There is going to be more rain for the next two, threedays," he said. "We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal toabove normal moisture this week."    Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southernMinnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in easternNebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.    Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend butwere receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.    Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio withthudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.    "Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, apretty good rain," Mohler said.    Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparkingan early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board ofTrade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.    Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt isexpected to move over the central Midwest, then move northlater in the week. That could bring new rain patterns acrossthe Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions asearly-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stagein early July, he said. Reuter

Spain is threatened with massive imports from thirdcountries by the end of the year, they said.    They said the imports are due to come in as a result of theaccord by which the EC has promised the United States it willimport two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghuminto Spain from third countries this year.    Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under areduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee maydecide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board tomake direct purchases.    The sources said Romero urged that other EC countriesshould take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of theSpanish market.    They said he threatened to withhold support for the ECCommission plan for new limits on farm output which if breachedwould mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.

SENATE PANEL STUDIES LOAN RATE, SET ASIDE PLANS The Senate Agriculture Committee wasexpected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments incounty loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn andwheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.    A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy(D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan ratedifferentials to no more than one pct per year from thenational average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.    The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary toincrease the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by"an appropriate amount to generate savings" if projected cornstocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.    Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat setaside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels. Reuter
