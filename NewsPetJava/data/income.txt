FEBRUARY U.S. JOBS GAINS SHOW STRONGER ECONOMY Momentum in th U.S. economy may bepicking up given solid across-the board increases in theFebruary U.S. employment report, economists said.    U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February,twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previouslyreported 448,000 increase.    "Even if you look at January and February together, this isstill a much stronger report than the consensus expectation inthe market," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.    Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal muchlarger gains in February U.S. production and income thanpreviously forecast.    The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week sinceNovember 1966, the Commerce Department said.    "The gains in manufacturing employment point to a verylarge increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7pct," said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Incnoted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hourin February from 8.83 dlrs in January.    "Combined with the increase in hours worked, this meanswe'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-visthe wage and salary disbursement," he said.    Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income shouldrise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.    He said the February employment gains are consistent withhis firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national productgrowth forecast of 3.7 pct.    Economists agreed that the employment data were negativefor the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economyand no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Butmost said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.    "This report is another reason for the Fed to not considereasing," said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.    "It gives them more room to address the dollar situation," hesaid. "If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,but it's most likely they'll sit and wait."    "The data have not been uniform," Stone added. "Durablegoods were weak in January and now employment is strong."    In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gapwidened to 14.8 billion dlrs.    "Things just aren't adding up," said Steve Slifer of LehmanGoverment Securities Inc. "Consumer spending, capital spending,goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak firstquarter GNP growth of one pct," he said.    "The employment and production data point to a biginventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourthquarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth."    Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain wasaccounted for by striking workers in the steel and machineryindustries returning to work.    Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gainshave resulted from an improving trade outlook.    Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exportsgrew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase inimports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improvein the first quarter.    "Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paperproducts, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods showthat trade is improving," Benderley said.    "The economy is moving between extremes," he said. "Somereports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarterGNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct."    A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greaterpart of February's employment gain. Retail services employmentrose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 inJanuary, previously reported at 166,000.    Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. Butthis follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised downfrom a previously reported 142,000 gain.    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged inFebruary at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading sinceMarch 1980, the Commerce Department noted.    "The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,"Carson said. "This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that."       Reuter
U.K. EARNINGS RISE 7.6 PCT IN YEAR TO JANUARY U.K. Average earnings rose a seasonallyadjusted 7.6 pct in the year to end-January after a 7.4 pctrise in the year to December, the Department of Employmentsaid.    The underlying rise was 7.5 pct after 7.75 pct in December.    The January index, base 1980, was set at a provisionalseasonally adjusted 190.4, down from 193.4 in December.    The underlying rise, adjusted for factors such as back-payand timing variations, had been steady at 7.5 pct from October1985 to October 1986.    Unit wage costs in U.K. Manufacturing industry rose 3.3 pctin the three months to end January, on a year-on-year basis,after a 3.1 pct rise in the three months to end December, theDepartment of Employment said.    In January, the unit wage rise in manufacturing industrieswas 3.6 pct, unchanged from the December rise.    The Department said the decline in the underlying rate ofrise in earnings reflected the reduced significance of bonuspayments in January compared with December.    The actual increase reflected teacher pay settlements andindustrial action in the transport and communications sectorsin January 1987. REUTER
U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - SPENDING, M-1 Brisk increases in personal income andconsumption are to appear in February data released today, butthe bond market's recent sluggishness suggests there will be nomajor price reaction unless the rises are much larger thanexpected, economists said.    Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct,compared with no change in January, while consumptionexpenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct,reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January.    M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also bereleased. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected.        Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Incexpects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wageand salary disbursements in February.    Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, theaverage workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose byfour cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durablegoods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of atleast 1.5 pct in consumption, he added.    The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bondmarket much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slippingjust 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct.    Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrowrange, desperately seeking direction.    "Seasonally adjusted, it's already December in the bondmarket," quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities CoInternational Inc.    Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said thesteadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite somesigns of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectationsthat inflation will remain subdued.    But he warned that this assumption might not be justified.    "It took the bond market a long while to see that inflationwas not returning to double digits, and now that it has learnedthat lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to fivepct inflation is a real possibility ahead," Boltz said in areport.    After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds wereindicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct. Reuter
U.S. PERSONAL INCOME ROSE 0.9 PCT IN FEBRUARY, SPENDING UP U.S. personal income rose 0.9 pct,or 32.4 billion dlrs, in February to a seasonally adjustedannual rate of 3,581.3 billion dlrs, the Commerce Departmentsaid.    The increase followed a revised 0.2 pct rise in personalincome during January. Earlier, the department estimatedJanuary personal income was unchanged.    The February incomes rise was the largest monthly increasesince a 1.2 pct rise in April 1986, the department said. Itattributed last month's rise to several factors, includingsubsidy payments to farmers and government pay raises.    The department said personal consumption expenditures wereup during February by 1.7 pct or 49.1 billion dlrs to 2,855.9billion dlrs after falling by 58.4 billion dlrs or two pct inJanuary.    Purchases of durable goods were up 24.8 billion dlrs lastmonth after decreasing by 69.7 billion dlrs in January withsales of motor vehicles accounting for most of the Februaryincrease and the January decline, the department said.    Purchases of nondurables rose 10.7 billion dlrs in Februaryafter a 300 mln dlr increase in January.    The Commerce Department said wage and salary incomes wereup 15.6 billion dlrs in February after an 8.6 billion dlr risein January.    Manufacturing payrolls increased by 2.4 billion dlrs lastmonth after rising 1.9 billion dlrs in February with the gainswidespread through durable and nondurable industries, thedepartment said.    Farmers' incomes increased by 12.2 billion dlrs in Februaryafter declining by 8.7 billion dlrs in January. Both lastmonth's increase and January's fall in farm incomes was becauseof government subsidy payments, the department said.    Personal tax and nontax payments fell 5.5 billion dlrs inFebruary following a 19.5 billion dlrs January drop. The declines were a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.    Federal withheld income taxes were up in February from amonth earlier but that was offset by declines in federalnonwithheld taxes and lower state and local income taxes.    Disposable personal income in February after taxes was up1.2 pct or 37.8 billion dlrs to 3,063.4 billion dlrs afterrising 25.8 billion dlrs in January.    The personal savings rate eased to 3.6 pct in February fromfour pct in January, the department said. Reuter

U.S. REAL EARNINGS ROSE 0.6 PCT IN FEBRUARY The average weekly earnings of U.S.workers after adjustment for inflation and seasonal changesrose 0.6 pct in February after being unchanged in January, theLabor department said.    The department had earlier reported that real earnings fell0.3 pct in January but revised the figure to show earningsunchanged.    Between February this year and February, 1986, realearnings rose 0.5 pct, the department said.    The rise in February real earnings resulted from a 0.5 pctincrease in average hourly earnings and a 0.6 pct increase inaverage weekly hours. That was partly offset by a 0.4 pct risein the consumer price index, which measures inflation, thedepartment said.    Before seasonal adjustment, weekly earnings last monthaveraged 307.59 dlrs, up from 305.13 dlrs in January and upfrom 300.66 dlrs in February, 1986. Reuter...
YUGOSLAV ECONOMY WORSENED IN 1986, BANK DATA SHOWS National Bank economic data for 1986shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation raterose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded andthe value of the dinar fell.    The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pcthigher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first threemonths of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hardcurrency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.    Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures indinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollarsbased on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.    Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with theconvertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to adeterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currencyarea rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.    Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 whileindustrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's datashowed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.    Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wageswere too high given the level of productivity.    Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of thelast quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.    Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 moneysupply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth offoreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrsabroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.    The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hardcurrencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against theSwiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar,46.2 pct. REUTER
U.S. PERSONAL INCOME ROSE 0.2 PCT IN MARCH U.S. personal income rose 0.2 pct,or 5.4 billion dlrs, in March to a seasonally adjusted annualrate of 3,603.9 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.

Personal consumption expenditures rose 0.3 pct, or 8.9billion dlrs, to 2,882.6 billion dlrs in March after rising arevised 2.4 pct in February instead of the previously reported1.7 pct rise, the department said.    Last month's income gain matched a 0.2 pct rise in Novemberand was the lowest since June when income was unchanged. Thespending rise was the weakest since January's 2.0 pct decline.    The department said the slowdown in income was mainly dueto a drop in subsidies to farmers. Excluding that factor,personal income rose 0.4 pct in March and 0.7 pct in February.    Wages and salaries rose 7.4 billion dlrs last month aftergaining 16.6 billion dlrs in February, while manufacturingpayrolls declined 1.3 billion dlrs after rising 2.5 billiondlrs in February. Reuter
CHINA'S WAGE BILL GREW TOO FAST IN FIRST QUARTER China's total wage bill for stateemployees grew too fast in the first quarter, because ofexcessive bonuses, allowances and overtime pay, the officialEconomic Information newspaper said.    It said the total wage bill in the period was 38.7 billionyuan, an increase of 16.7 pct over the first quarter of 1986,when the bill grew a year-on-year 16.3 pct.

Industrial output grew a 14.1 pct inthe period.    The newspaper said state allowances rose in the period by20 pct over the corresponding 1986 quarter, with some areas andwork units increasing coal and electricity allowances on theirown without proper authorisation.

BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING A trade-led boom in the U.S. isunlikely this year or next because growth in net exports willmerely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending andother sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in itslatest economic report.    Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending willcontribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.    As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.    "Growth in consumer spending in the United States will dropdramatically this year because the jump in inflation will causea falloff in the growth of disposable income," Van Dyke said.    Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.    The report was released before the Commerce Departmentreported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personalconsumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared witha 0.6 pct increase the month before.    The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boostconsumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.    This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.    As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing powerof an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrsthis year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.    The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housingstarts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.    "For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988or 1989 is more than a remote possibility," Van Dyke said.    Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on animprovement in trade. "However, with protectionist attitudes onthe rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk," headded. Reuter
