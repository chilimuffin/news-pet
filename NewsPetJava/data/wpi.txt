U.S. PRODUCER PRICES ROSE 0.1 PCT IN FEB AFTER 0.6 PCT  The U.S. Producer Price Index forfinished goods rose 0.1 pct on a seasonally adjusted basis inFebruary, the Labor Department said.    The increase came after a 0.6 pct increase in producerprices in January.    Higher energy prices were primarily responsible for theincrease in February, though they rose at a slower pace thanthey had in January, the department said.    The finished goods index was up 0.1 pct from its February,1986 level.    Before seasonal adjustment, the index for finished goodsstood at 292.3 over its 1967 base of 100.

Butprice increases slowed sharply for gasoline and home heatingoil, the department said.    There were some price declines, including a 3.4 pct fallfor passenger cars and 1.3 pct for light trucks from Januarylevels. This reflected expanded factory-financed rebates anddiscount loan programs, the department said.

FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U.S. FEBRUARY ECONOMY U.S. February reports reflecting slimgains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressuresreinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continueto follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said.    "If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything," saidSteve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc.    "There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflationfront, all is well," he said. "Money supply is well undercontrol. It's an absolutely ideal situation."    February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightlyless than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's productionnumber, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.    The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pctrise in the PPI in January.    "The Fed is going to look at this positively," said AllanLeslie of Discount Corporation. "Certainly inflation is not asbad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrialproduction growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants."    The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct inFebruary, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.    "This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflationis behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs perbarrel," said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "Thetrend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year."    In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pctdecline in the PPI.    Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car pricesfell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.    Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said thata possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in boththe financial markets and the Federal Reserve.    "The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectationstoday," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.    While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easiermonetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise thiscould necessitate a weaker dollar.    "The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air," hesaid. "We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete withforeign producers."    Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pctin February's PPI. With many electronic goods producedoverseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raisingprices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.    If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminishoverseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which mightnecessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.    By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting toa large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real valueof the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.    Slifer said import prices may rise further asmanufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar droppedto current levels expire, and new contracts are made thatreflect a weaker dollar.    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that importedmanufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in thesecond half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.industrial output.    "It's the other side of the lower dollar," Wyss said."Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitiveand they are increasing output."    Wyss said that the latest data point to an averageindustrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter."It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector isbeginning to revive."    But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. Hesaid much of the strength came from factors that do not pointto a sustained rise in industrial output.    Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farmequipment industries helped account for a one pct rise inFebruary business equipment production.    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energywas produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.    Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted forhalf of the industrial production gain as production of autoassemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5million units.    "In the first quarter, it looks like automakers areproducing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling atroughly a seven mln unit rate," Roach said. "The disparitybetween output and sales is showing up in inventories."    Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. businessinventories as a sign that production may be outstrippingdemand in the first quarter of 1987.    January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gainsince July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the CommerceDepartment said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, thelargest monthly sales drop on record.    Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react tomonth-to-month changes. "The Fed has been standing pat for thelast seven months," Ramirez said. "They will continue to standpat for at least the next couple of months." Reuter

Wholesale prices fell 0.6 pct in January from December.    The index fell 9.1 pct from a year earlier for the 21ststraight year-on-year drop, the central bank said.

The index was down 7.1 pct from a year earlier.    The import price index rose 1.1 pct from a month earlier to57.4 for the sixth successive month-on-month gain mainly due tothe continued strength of world crude oil prices. But the indexwas down 29 pct from a year earlier.    The domestic price index fell 0.1 pct to 91.9 in February,its 24th straight monthly drop, mainly reflecting falls inprices of home appliances such as colour televisions due tosevere sales competition at home. Lower edible oil prices addedto the decline.    The index was down 6.7 pct from a year earlier.    The domestic index marked its largest year-on-year drop of7.1 pct in January since the central bank started compilingsuch statistics in 1960 under its current system.    Wholesale prices are likely to turn upward in March ashigher world crude oil and raw material prices are expected,the bank said. REUTER

Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with theconvertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to adeterioration in trade.

U.K. MARCH PRODUCER PRICES RISE 0.3 PCT The price index for sales ofmanufactured goods in the U.K. Rose a provisional, unadjusted0.3 pct in March after an identical rise in February,Department of Trade and Industry figures show.    The index for materials and fuel purchased by manufacturingindustry fell a provisional and unadjusted 1.1 pct after a 1.7pct fall in February.    The Department said the year-on-year rise in producerprices in March was a provisional 3.7 pct, compared with aprovisional 4.2 pct increase in the year to end-February.

The index for input prices, also not seasonally adjusted,was set at 128.2 in March after February's 129.6.    The 1.1 pct fall in input prices between February and Marchwas mainly due to a seasonal fall in industrial electricitycosts and lower scheduled prices for petroleum products, theDepartment said.    The Department said these falls were only partly offset bya rise in prices of home-produced food manufacturing materials.

U.K. PRODUCER PRICES SEEN MOVED BY TECHNICALITIES U.K. Producer price data for March wereroughly as expected after taking into account technical factorswhich affected the year-on-year outcome, economic analystssaid.    The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonallyadjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged fromFebruary and close to the average for the last six months.    The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pctin February.    But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips andDrew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected arise in excise duties which affected the index in March lastyear.    He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much intothe monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in Aprilwould take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct.    Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' inputprices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factorssuch as a fall in industrial electricity costs.    Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures wereslightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterlinghad not yet reduced input prices as much as expected.    Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep inputcosts down over the next few months, although Tinker added thatlast year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of theyear-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return torises in the index rather than falls.
