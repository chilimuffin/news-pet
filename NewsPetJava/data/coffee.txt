ICO PRODUCERS TO PRESENT NEW COFFEE PROPOSAL International Coffee Organization, ICO,producing countries will present a proposal for reintroducingexport quotas for 12 months from April 1 with a firmundertaking to try to negotiate up to September 30 any futurequota distribution on a new basis, ICO delegates said.    Distribution from April 1 would be on an unchanged basis asin an earlier producer proposal, which includes shortfallredistributions totalling 1.22 mln bags, they said.    Resumption of an ICO contact group meeting with consumers,scheduled for this evening, has been postponed until tomorrow,delegates said. Reuter
ICO EXPORTERS TO MODIFY NEW PROPOSAL International Coffee Organization (ICO)exporters will modify their new proposal on quota resumptionbefore presenting it to importers tomorrow, ICO delegates said.    The change, which will be discussed tonight informallyamong producers, follows talks after the formal producersession with the eight-member producer splinter group and willaffect the proposed quota distribution for 12 months from Aprilone, they said.    The proposed share-out would still include shortfalldeclarations, they said. Reuter
PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS Talks on the possibility of reintroducingglobal coffee export quotas have been extended into today, withsparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters wasnot included in a key negotiating forum.    The special meeting of the International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop aprolonged slide in coffee prices.    However, delegates said no solution to the question of howto implement quotas was yet in sight.    World coffee export quotas -- the major device used toregulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement-- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction toa drought which cut Brazil"s output by nearly two thirds.    Brazil is the world"s largest coffee producer and exporter.    Producers and consumers now are facing off over thequestion of how quotas should be calculated under any futurequota distribution scheme, delegates said.    Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eightproducing countries was not represented in a contact group offive producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates whichwas set up to facilitate debate.    The big producers "want to have the ball only in their courtand it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante ofCosta Rica said.    The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotasApril 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quotashares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas beforeSeptember 30, delegates said.    Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazilto retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the exportmarket, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesiasix pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.    But consuming countries and the dissident producer grouphave tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determinedby availability, using a formula incorporating exportableproduction and stocks statistics.    Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share andColombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quotadistribution scheme into effect now rather than later.    Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposalthat would reduce its quota share, delegates said.    Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement ona quota package. "Anything is possible at this phase," evenadjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said.    If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on thesupermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as aresult, industry sources said.    Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained aboutsteady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so anupswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either,they said. REUTER
COFFEE QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE, NO ACCORD SEEN LIKELY The International Coffee Organization(ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continuedwith an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, butdelegates said prospects for an accord between producers andconsumers were diminishing by the minute.    The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide incoffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight withoutagreement, delegates said.    The council is expected to agree to reconvene either withinthe next six weeks or in September, they said.    The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it becameapparent consumers and producers could not compromise on theformula for calculating any future quota system, delegatessaid.    Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when pricessoared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop bynearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffeeproducer and exporter.

ICO TALKS ON COFFEE QUOTAS TO RESUME AT NOON Talks on coffee export quotas at theInternational Coffee Organization (ICO) special council sessionwill resume at noon gmt today, following a last minute decisiontaken early this morning to extend the meeting 24 hours, ICOofficials said.    An 18 member contact group will meet at midday to examinenew ideas, and the full council is to convene at 1900gmt, theysaid.    The extension resulted from a last ditch effort by Colombiato salvage the talks, which by late yesterday looked perilouslyclose to ending without agreement on quotas, delegates said. REUTER
COFFEE QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE BUT NO AGREEMENT YET Coffee quota talks at the InternationalCoffee Organization council meeting here continued thisafternoon, but producers and consumers still had not reachedcommon ground on the key issue of how to estimate exportquotas, delegates said.    The 54 member contact group was examining a Colombianproposal to resume quotas April 1 under the ad hoc system usedhistorically, with a pledge to meet again in September todiscuss how quotas would be worked out in the future, theysaid.    Delegates would not speculate on the prospects foragreement at this time.    "Anything could happen," one delegate said. Reuter
ICO QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE, OUTCOME HARD TO GAUGE Talks at the extended special meeting ofthe International Coffee Organization (ICO) on thereintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances ofsuccess were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said.    Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombianproposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September,with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a newquota system would be calculated in September for the new cropyear, they said.    Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching aquota agreement varied widely.    Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightlymore optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any ofits traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share lookslikely to preclude any accord, other delegates said.    No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative hadbeen tabled formally today, delegates said.    A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for aprogress report, delegates said. Reuter
SENIOR DELEGATES PESSIMISTIC ON ICO TALKS Efforts to break an impasse betweencoffee exporting and importing countries over regulating theworld coffee market in the face of falling prices appear tohave failed, senior delegates said after a contact groupmeeting. The full ICO council is due to meet this evening.    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) JorioDauster told Reuters after the contact group meeting there hadbeen no agreement on quotas as consumers had tried to dictatemarket shares rather than negotiate them.    Dauster said there are no plans yet to renew negotiationsat a later date. Reuter
ICO COUNCIL ENDS IN FAILURE TO AGREE QUOTAS A special meeting of the InternationalCoffee Organization (ICO) council failed to agree on how to setcoffee export quotas, ICO delegates said.    Producers and consumers could not find common ground on theissue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, oftenheated talks, delegates said.    Export quotas -- the major device of the InternationalCoffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a yearago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought inBrazil which cut its output by two thirds.    Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffeeprices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four yearlows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting. Reuter
COFFEE TRADERS EXPECT SELLOFF AFTER ICO TALKS FAIL The failure of the International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotascould trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of atleast 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.    Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.    A special meeting between importing and exporting countriesended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talksover how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discussquotas was set, delegates said.    Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under theInternational Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago afterprices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.    With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producerselling initially and a price war among commercial coffeeroasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.    Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarketshelf this spring, coffee dealers said.    The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer andexporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for thebreakdown of the talks.    Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative anddelegate to the talks, said in a statement after the counciladjourned, "A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were notprepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objectivecriteria.    "We want to insure that countries receive export quotasbased on their ability to supply the market, instead of theirpolitical influence in the ICO."    Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Daustercountered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried todictate quotas, not negotiate them."    Previously, quotas were determined by historical amountsexported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global marketof about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wantedquotas to continue under this basic scheme.    But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producersproposed carving up the export market on the basis ofexportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil'sshare to 28.8 pct.    Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changesin many countries' export capabilities and make coffee morereadily available to consumers when they need it.    A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largestexporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interimproposal could not bring the two sides together.    Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems,illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments onbank debt, have increased political pressure on the country toprotect its coffee export earnings.    Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavilyon coffee earnings, particularly some African nations andColombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failureto agree quotas, analysts said.    The expected drop in prices could result in losses of asmuch as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegatesforecast.    The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the fullcouncil is not due to meet again until September, delegatessaid. REUTER
COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT TERM - DUTCH ROASTERS This morning's sharp decline in coffeeprices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiationsin London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization,ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said.    "The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to thefailure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but itwill not be long before reality reasserts itself and pricesrise again," a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasterssaid.    "The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffeeavailable at present, there is a shortage of quality," he said.    "Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following thenews of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again toaround 120 cents within a few weeks," the roaster added.    Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vriessaid although the roasters were disappointed at the failure ofconsumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quotareintroduction, it was equally important that quotas bereallocated on a more equitable basis.    "There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment becausethe market is well balanced and we must not lose thisopportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement," he said.    "There is still a lot of work to be done on a number ofclauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would notwelcome quota reintroduction until we have a completerenegotiation," de Vries added.    With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to havefairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for theforeseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on ahand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market priceswere below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.

ZIMBABWE COFFEE OUTPUT SET TO RISE Zimbabwean coffee output will reach13,000 tonnes this year, up on just over 11,000 tonnes producedin 1986, the Commercial Coffee Growers Association said.    Administrative Executive Robin Taylor told the domesticnews agency ZIANA that Zimbabwe earned the equivalent of 33 mlnU.S. Dlrs from coffee exports last year. He would not say howmuch the country would earn in 1987.    Taylor said the 173 commercial coffee growers under hisassociation had increased production from 5,632 tonnes in 1980to more than 11,000 tonnes in l986. Reuter
COFFEE TALKS COLLAPSE EASES NEED FOR U.S. BILL The collapse of International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, talks on export quotas yesterday removes theimmediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing thecustoms service to monitor coffee imports, analysts here said.    The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislationoffered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffeeimports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. Abill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).    However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reachagreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is notimmediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of thecoffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.    "You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now)this is an urgent issue," the coffee analyst said.

COLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL Coffee producing countries must quicklymap out a fresh common strategy following the failure of theInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement onexport quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's privatecoffee exporters' association, said.    Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing nowwould be to seek a unifying stand from producers, includingBrazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.    An ICO special meeting ended last night in London withexporting and consuming nations failing to agree on aresumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago afterprices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.    Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe butpredicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedlyplummet.    However, he said the market should also take into accountevident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of thenear totality of the Central American crop.    Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past10 years.    Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understandthe true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nationsas well as for industrialized countries.    It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made tosolve the problem of the developing world's external debt,decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repayingthose debts, he said.    "In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that,while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countrieswhich support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,"Cardenas said. Reuter
PERU COFFEE CROP UNAFFECTED BY RAINS Recent heavy rains have not affected thePeru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a recordharvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperativegroups said.    Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group ofcooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports,told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos)was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101quintales in the year to September 1986.    A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said floodwaters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and thecrop was unaffected.    Floods in early February caused extensive damage in VillaRica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales lastyear, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation.    Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop ifthey continued through to next month, when harvesting starts.    He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase thisyear in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales,assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO.    He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO memberslast year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICOmembers. Reuter
COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS Coffee prices may have to fall even lowerto bring exporting and importing countries once more round thenegotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates andtraders said.    The failure last night of International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agreeexport quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffeefutures markets today with the London May price reaching a4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne beforeending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previousclose.    The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.    Pressure will now build up on producers returning from theICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hopethe negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floorunder prices, some senior traders said.    The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb forMarch 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 centsa lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended inFebruary last year following a sharp rise in internationalprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and saidthey need to make hard commercial decisions. "If we have failedat the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now itis time to go and sell coffee."    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plansto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop nextmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Tradesources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with aprevious crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of publicselling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures marketlast year.    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to themarket "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months.    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a splitbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick forfuture quotas. Consumers said "objective criteria" like averageexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,Dauster said.    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation butconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" wayof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongstproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members andnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas andthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a setratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.    It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate"policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcometo participate they cannot dictate quotas which are verydifficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achievedifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICOand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared toaccept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it provesimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.    "We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and toencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock ifsupplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said.    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumerargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICOsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapseand how much producers will sink their differences shouldprices fall further and remain depressed.    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 butboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if realnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet inIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces andpolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries couldbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner thanmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force duringthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas beforeOctober are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO hascontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.    A clear difference between the pressures already being feltby importers and exporters was that consumers would have beenhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it couldnot be imposed now. At least in that way they said they couldshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability.    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug theseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these tolapse should lasting agreement not be found.    "Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after theirfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficientand we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said. Reuter
COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S. Failure of talks on re-establishingInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last weekmay put political pressure on the United States, particularlythe State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. isunlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by"objective criteria", U.S. officials said.    Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and headof Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on hisreturn from London that the United States is willing to resumethe coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.    Rosenbaum said the United States will be "flexible" indiscussing the method of establishing objective criteria andany transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim ofestablishing an objective method of setting quotas.    At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S.,proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculatedby a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportableproduction and verified stocks, while large producers led byBrazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division ofshares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced themarket share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer.    Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to supportlegislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to complywith any future coffee quotas.    He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing thecoffee policy situation following the collapse of the Londontalks, but "nobody is proposing we change our position."    However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffeepolicy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee marketoffensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,to soften the consumer position.    "Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil willkind of want to test the resolve of other producers andconsumers," said one U.S. official.    The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, saidBrazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next fewmonths in an effort to drive down prices and pressure othercountries, particularly the splinter group of small producerswho differed with the major producers in London.    This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from LatinAmerican countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to theU.S. State department, and to the National Security Council inthe White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.officials said.    The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffeepolicy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly frompolitically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.officials said.    El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombiaat the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based onobjective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Ricajoined the splinter group, which said it would agree toobjective criteria.    There is a strong feeling among some in the StateDepartment that the United States should continue to supportthe splinter group of producers who have taken thepolitically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objectivecriteria question, U.S. officials said.    Within the consuming countries there also is expected to besome pressure to reassess positions.    In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., theNetherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand onthe issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.    This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nationsto successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.    However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was attimes qualified and there is some concern that the EuropeanCommunity could come under pressure to be more accommodative toproducers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast andother African producers during the talks.    A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.    While political manuevering by small producers andconsuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said thekey to any future outcome will be Brazil's position.    U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for thefailure of the talks and said a more flexible position fromBrasilia would be the most important step toward agreement. Reuter
COLOMBIA BLASTS U.S. FOR COFFEE TALKS FAILURE Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviriablamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of lastweek's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on exportquotas.    "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexiblethan the one of Brazil, where current economic and politicalfactors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviriatold Reuters in an interview.    The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the otherfor the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce exportquotas after being extended through the weekend in London.    Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successfuloutcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigentattitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made itimpossible.    In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviriasaid the U.S. attitude would have serious economic andpolitical consequences, not necessarily for a country likeColombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and forsome African countries.    He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relativelyhigh level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.    According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, whichtraditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total exportrevenue.    That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400mln dlrs from 1986.    Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at thestart of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mlnbags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30. Reuter
RIO COFFEE TRADE PREFERS NO PACT TO QUOTA CUT The failure of talks to introducenew coffee export quotas within the International CoffeeAgreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazilhaving a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, Presidentof the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmonsaid.    He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptableas the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.    "Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,"Calmon added.    Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota,Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mlnbags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln,leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.    "It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this wasbetter than such a quota reduction," he added.    In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and greencoffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severedrought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under10 mln bags.    Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, ofwhich 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvestthis year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.    The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for lastyear's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believeit was higher than this. Reuter
COFFEE PRICE DROP NOT AFFECTING COLOMBIA'S DEBT the sharp fall in international coffeeprices will not affect colombia's external credit situation,finance minister cesar gaviria told reuters.    "our foreign debt is high, but we can pay, and I hope theforeign banking community will maintain its position toward us,"he said.    He said the current decline on world coffee markets was nottotally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing oncolombia's financial state, which he described as sound.    Gaviria said the decline in coffee prices could mean a lossof 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987.    The conservative party and the country's largest tradeunion called this week for the debt to be rescheduled followingthe price drop.    Colombia, the only major latin american country not to haverescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debtof 13.6 billion dlrs. Reuter
IVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT-LIVED Ivory Coast today predicted that thepresent coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of therecent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting inLondon would not last long.    Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumernations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten anoversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister DenisBra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually beobliged to restore their positions.    "I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April," hetold a news conference here at his return from the failedLondon talks.    Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day inLondon down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, thelowest since 1982.    Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs(1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned byIvory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if theslide on the world markets continues.    He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoaproducer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead anAfrican initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end ofnext month.    Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-basedInter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf ofthe continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks.    "An initiative from IACO is likely very soon," he saidwithout elaborating.    "Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarkedon a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragilemarket," he said.    Questioned by journalists, the minister said PresidentFelix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that hisgovernment would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteedby the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season.    Last year, the West African nation announced that thecoffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents)per kilo.    Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversifyits agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent fromworld market fluctuation.    A communique read over the state-run television tonightsaid that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteranIvorian leader reaffirmed "his faith in Ivory Coast's bright(economic) future" despite the commodities price slide.    The Agriculture Minister also announced the governmentdecided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mlndlrs) to support the country's small farmers.    Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one ofAfrica's showpiece economies, is going through difficult timesfollowing the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa andcoffee.    Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected togrow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986,according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate. Reuter

BRAZIL HAS NO SET COFFEE EXPORT TARGETS - IBC Brazil has no set target forits coffee exports following this week's breakdown ofInternational Coffee Organization talks on export quotas,President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Daustersaid.    He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider itsexport plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which ithad proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken asthe country's export target to ICO-member countries.    The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption anagreement would bring stability to world markets, he added.    It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack ofan agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could beabove or below 15.5 mln bags, he said.    Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters andmarket analysts before taking any decision on export policy,but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to marketconditions.    "We will not take any short-term decisions which might causemarkets to panic," Dauster added.    He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffeeto sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement.    "Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it doesnot need an ICO agreement as a crutch," Dauster said.    Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster saidconsumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to twomln bags in Brazil's export quotas.    "It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial lossfor Brazil and which would be difficult for the country torecover," he said.    The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year movingaverage of exportable production surpluses would lead tooverproduction as countries boosted output to win higherquotas, he said.    Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibilityhad been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that itsstance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries.    Close links would continue with these producers,particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone Africancountries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action wasenvisaged at present.    He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to asystem of roaster buying contracts, although "no hypothesis hasbeen abandoned."    Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations forMay shipment coffee will be opened.    He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policyof opening registrations for up to six months in advance, assome exporters had suggested.    He noted export registrations for the first four months ofthe year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between11.2 mln and 12 mln bags.    He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mlnbags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimateuntil late April. Reuter
MEXICO SUSPENDS OVERSEAS COFFEE SALES Mexico has temporarily suspendedoverseas coffee sales due to falling prices triggered by thefailure of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meetingto agree a quota system at its latest meeting, the officialNotimex news agency said.    "We're just waiting a while for prices to improve," anunidentified Mexican trader told the agency.    Mexico has already sold 80 pct of its export coffeeproduced in the year to last September, the source said. Thecountry exports about 3.3 mln 60-kilo bags a year. Reuter
COSTA RICA OPTIMISTIC ABOUT REFORMING ICO Costa Rica's economy minister said hesees new hope for winning changes in the International CoffeeOrganisation system of export quotas.    Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president ofthe Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful becauseof the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing-nations by such major consumers as the United States, Britainand the Netherlands at last week's ICO meeting in london.    Escalante told a news conference here he "carried the weightof the negotiations" at the meeting by calling for larger exportquotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations.    Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quotasystem based on a producing nation's real export capacity, onceit has satisfied internal demand.    "There are countries such as our own whose salespossibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their currentquotas," Escalante said.    At the same time, there are countries favoured by thecurrent system that have been assigned quotas far above theirexport potential, he said.    The current ICO quota system is "unfair and autocratic,"Escalante said.    Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffeeprices over the last week to speculation rather than realmatters of supply and demand.    "Be careful," he warned, "there's not as much coffee in theworld as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust." Reuter

UGANDA DISAPPOINTED BY COFFEE TALKS FAILURE Uganda, Africa's second largest coffeeproducer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffeetalks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee MarketingBoard, CMB, said.    "This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in asituation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne ofrobusta coffee," J. Makumbi said when he returned from London onFriday.    Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formulato share the world's coffee production during InternationalCoffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week.    Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which weresuspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that itsquota be increased dramatically.    Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually fromcoffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings --had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB.    The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to overthree mln bags.    For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICOexport quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.    The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties forabout 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employsover half of salaried manpower.    In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's Agriculture and LivestockDevelopment Minister Paul Bomani said today Third Worldcountries would suffer from the failure of the London coffeetalks.    "It is only the middlemen who will benefit, he said.    Bomani called on the ICO to convene another meeting withintwo months, saying, "Once tempers have cooled and delegationshave had time to report back to their headquarters, commonsense will prevail."

INDONESIA PRESSING FOR COMPROMISE OVER COFFEE Indonesian coffee exporters arepreparing for a period of depressed prices while urging theirgovernment to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue ofexport quotas, the chairman of the Association of IndonesianCoffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters.    Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia,the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs andimproving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas.    "But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, wecan never bridge the gap," Dharyono said.    Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries,along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed anew quota system at last month's failed International CoffeeOrganistion (ICO) talks in London.    Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under theGroup of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal.    AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contactswith Brazil to suggest a compromise.    Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICOnegotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eightwere in contact with Colombia, the world's second largestproducer, but gave no details.    "Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from acompromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present marketstays like it is," Muda said.    He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as theU.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead ofan ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1.    Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S.And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and pressthem to present Indonesia's case more firmly.    He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help thecountry's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations.    Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground withthe big consumers because they agreed on the need for basingquotas on what he termed "realistic criteria."    The breakaway group believes the old quota system, whichgives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does notreflect up-to-date supply and demand trends.    Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the oldsystem be applied.    Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when marketprices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop.    Although prices have long since come down to a point whereexport controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumersat the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on newguidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are bothrefusing to alter their positions.    Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believedIndonesia was well placed to survive low prices.    Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and theAICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said.    Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30,is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's levelof 360,000 tonnes, he said.    He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average forthe time of year. REUTER
NO NEAR TERM BRAZIL COFFEE MOVES EXPECTED The Brazilian Coffee Institute,IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until theend of next week at the earliest, trade sources said.    IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting governmentministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assessBrazil's position in the light of the failure of talks inLondon earlier this month to set new International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, export quotas.    "The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethinkits position completely," one Santos exporter said.    A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set forThursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explainhis plan to members then before announcing any new measures.    Dauster told reporters on his return from London last weekthat no decisions would be made on exports before he had heldtalks with all sectors of the industry.    Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure tostart marketing coffee immediately. World prices have beenrecovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICOtalks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilosfor export in the first four months of this year.    The exporters said the key factor in the eventual openingof May and June export registrations will be the amount atwhich the contribution quota is set.    With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanismssuch as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees beingintroduced, the level of the quota will be decisive indetermining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on worldmarkets, they said.    They noted that on February 16, the eve of a plannedincrease in the quota, April registrations were opened andclosed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a recordamount for a single day.    If May/June registrations are opened under similarconditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty inselling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.    "The problem would be how to limit sales," one exporter said.    Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems meanthere are pressures from the government to boost exports tomaximise foreign exchange earnings.    However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt amarketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominantposition as an exporter, but without causing a price war.    General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would planto export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO.    The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be aroundthe figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas werereintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired withthe breakdown of talks.    With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags thisyear, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags aftermeeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added.    However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even toconsider exporting such quantities, as this would almostinevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried toencroach on other producers' markets.    Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderlymarketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil'smarket share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mlnbags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordialrelations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stanceat the ICO talks, they added.

COLOMBIA'S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE Colombia intends to improve themarketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility onsetting export registration prices, finance minister CesarGaviria said.    Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower exportregistration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dockNew York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.    "In the first stage, we decided not only to lower thereintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro thatwill allow private exporters to participate more actively inColombia's coffee export policy," he said.    Traders said this means the export registration price willchange more often in a truer reflection of market trends.    Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new marketfactors since a return to a system of International CoffeeOrganisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the shortterm.    ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlockover re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February1986.    Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily sufferfrom depressed prices because it can compensate lower priceswith increased volume.    "Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount ofcoffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will doso without an agreement among producers," he said.    He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5mln bags as mentioned in market circles, "because the idea isprecisely not to disrupt the market."    Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86coffee year which ended last September 30.    Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of thenational coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought toadapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.    "There is great expectation in the world for the policiesthat Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning toemerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in theimmediate future," he told journalists.    Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future exportpolicy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.    Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place whenproblems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talkshave been resolved.    Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta sayingIndonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil tosuggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said theBrazilian stand was quite clear.    He said Brazil's current quota "reflects the reality of themarket, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand," butadded more clarity was needed to assess the criteria thatdetermined it.    Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failureof the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear amongdealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producerswould go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible,which did not happen.

UGANDA RE-ROUTES COFFEE EXPORTS THROUGH KISUMU Long delays at the railway crossing onthe Kenyan border have led Uganda to re-route its coffeeexports through a ferry link with the Kenyan port of Kisumuacross Lake Victoria, Ugandan officials based in Kenya said.    Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port ofMombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external tradebut there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons, they said.    Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two tothree at the Malaba rail border crossing, a Ugandan Railwaysofficial said. "Malaba is now handling only 10 pct of the tradeand all the coffee and oil goes through Kisumu," he said.    However, an accident recently damaged the wagon ferry whichplies between Kisumu and the Ugandan port of Jinja, causingbottlenecks on the lake route too.    Sources at the Coffee Marketing Board in Kampala reporteddelays in coffee export shipments last January due tocongestion on the lake ferries.    Coffee accounts for about 95 pct of Uganda's exportearnings and last November President Yoweri Museveni orderedall coffee shipments to be carried by rail in order to avoidthe higher costs of road haulage.

NO HEAVY COFFEE EXPORT IMPLIED-COLOMBIA OFFICIAL A decision by Colombia to open coffeeexport registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply thecountry will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld,Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'association, told Reuters.    Colombia today opened export registrations for april andmay, with the National Coffee Growers' Federation setting nolimit.    Since the start of the coffee year last october, privateexporters were on average allowed 350,000 bags of 60 kilos permonth.    "Traders will initially interpret this measure as announcingheavy sales. Even today it pressured the market. But it willquickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to goover the top," Arango said in an interview.    "Colombia's marketing policy is to sell without haste butconsistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will reactto market factors adequately. Colombia has no intention to giveits coffee away," he added.    Arango described measures adopted here yesterday, includinga lower export registration price, as a major change inColombia's coffee marketing policy.    The export registration price, or reintegro, was lowered to1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock new york, or 155.83 dlrs per bag of 70kilos, from 1.35 dlrs (194.33 dlrs).    The government announced a more flexible policy ofreintegro, in order to closely reflect market trends, whicharango warmly welcomed saying private exporters willundoubtedly be more actively present in the market.    A frequent gap between international market prices and thereintegro was unlikely to recur, he said. Reuter

COLOMBIA COFFEE EXPORTERS BELIEVE IN PRAGMATISM Private coffee exporters say Colombia'smore pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that thecountry does not suffer excessively from current depressedprices and erratic market conditions.    Gilberto Arango, president of the exporters' association,said in an interview that Colombia, the world's second largestproducer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence ofInternational Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas.    "Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit mostfrom this situation," he said.    Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock overre-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986,and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue.    Arango said that government measures adopted here lastweek, including a lower export registration price, indicated amajor change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism.    "This is the start of a new era in Colombia because worldmarket conditions are also new," he said.    The government lowered local taxes for exporters and saidthe export registration price, or reintegro, will be changedmore often in order to closely reflect market trends.    Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude wasthe decision on Friday to open export registrations for anunlimited amount.    But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavyselling of coffee.    "Our marketing policy is to sell without haste butconsistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will reactto market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention ofgiving its coffee away."    Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcomingexports, he said.    "We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags butneither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows fullwell what Colombia's export potential is," he said.    Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags,exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee yearwhich ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986.    Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictionsbut said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would notexceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by theNational Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S.Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was "ridiculous."    He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in thenumber one producing province of Antioquia, meant output waslikely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare andoscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags.    On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango saidColombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managedto force a compromise.    Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and headof his nation's delegation in London, has blamed theintransigence of some big countries, without naming them.    However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister CesarGaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United Stateswould undoubtedly be under great political pressure in comingweeks to revise its policy.    "Washington will have to take into account that for manycountries, and some of its allies for instance in CentralAmerica, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would havefar-reaching political and economic consequences."    Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on exportquotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve whichcould emerge from continuous contacts. Reuter

MADAGASCAR COFFEE PRODUCTION SEEN LOWER IN 1987 Madagascar's available coffeeoutput is estimated at 80,725 tonnes this year, down from82,210 in 1986, due to a rundown of government agriculturalservices and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas,Agriculture Ministry sources said.    This is after accounting for the loss of some 15,000 to20,000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside,they said.    The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987,but they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes lastyear from 41,662 in 1985.    Low yields from the country's ageing coffee plantations andprevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix alsocontributed to the poor performance, the sources said.    They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar's coffee busheswere planted before 1930.    The sources said Madagascar was still a long way fromreaching the production target of 110,000 tonnes per year andthe export target of 63,000 tonnes outlined in the government's1986-1990 five-year plan.    In order to reverse the decline in coffee production, thegovernment has decided to plant 20,000 hectares withhigh-yielding arabica and canephora varieties, the sourcessaid.    The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed atproducing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a lowcaffeine content.    The sources added that Madagascar's plan to export roastedcoffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems. Only650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year. Reuter

In opening the meeting, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortegasaid the lack of an accord on export quotas was behind fallingcoffee prices, which he said have caused billions of dollars inlosses to countries in the region.    Jorio Dauster, president of the Brazilian Coffee Institute,said his government is committed to working towards anproducers accord in order to bring about higher prices. REUTER
GOOD DEMAND FOR COLOMBIANS ON BREMEN MARKET The Bremen green coffee market attractedgood buying interest for Colombian coffee last week, whileBrazils were almost neglected, trade sources said.    Buyers were awaiting the opening of Brazil's exportregistrations for May shipment, which could affect prices forsimilar qualities, they said.    Colombia opened export registrations and good businessdeveloped with both the FNC and private shippers. Prices weresaid to have been very attractive, but details were notimmediately available.    Central Americans were sought for spot and afloat.    In the robusta sector nearby material was rather scarce,with turnover limited, the sources said.

COLOMBIA COFFEE REVENUE SHARPLY DOWN IN JAN/FEB Colombia's coffee export revenue dropped97 mln dlrs to 233.6 mln dlrs for the first two months of theyear against 330.9 mln dlrs in the similar period of 1986,central bank preliminary figures show.    Experts attributed the fall to lower world market pricesfollowing the failure to re-introduce international coffeeexport quotas, but they said Colombia could compensate the dropwith higher exports in calendar 1987.    Coffee export revenue for 1986 was 2.33 billion dlrs,according to the bank.    Jorge Cardenas, manager of the National Coffee Growers'Federation, last week estimated the recent drop of 30 cents alb in coffee prices would mean a net loss revenue of 457 mlndlrs for Colombia.    But he stressed that Colombia, with stockpiles of 10 mln(60-kg) bags, had the capacity to export more and would use arecently-introduced more flexible marketing policy to do so. Reuter
IBC PRESIDENT NOT TO ATTEND ICO EXECUTIVE BOARD Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC)president Jorio Dauster said he will not attend the ICOexecutive board meeting and was surprised to hear that a reportof his absence had a slightly depressing effect on the New Yorkcoffee market today.

DAUSTER SAYS NO CHANGE IN BRAZIL'S COFFEE POLICY Brazil will not announce anychanges to its coffee export policy, Brazilian Coffee Institute(IBC) president Jorio Dauster said.    He told Reuters Brazil was not planning to modify theposition it held before the recent International CoffeeOrganisation meeting.    Earlier this month, talks in London to set new ICO exportquotas failed.    Commenting on the outcome of a coffee producers' meeting inManagua last weekend, Dauster said that they discussed nothinginvolving the market.    "In the meeting we agreed to work on behalf of the union ofthe producers in matters related to an international agreement,"Dauster said.

CARDENAS SEES NO MAJOR DECISIONS AT ICO MEETING Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia'scoffee growers' federation, said he did not believe anyimportant decisions would emerge from an upcoming meeting ofthe International Coffee Organization (ICO).    The ICO executive board is set to meet in London from March31 and could decide to call a special council session by theend of April to discuss export quotas.    "It's going to be a routine meeting, an update of what hasbeen happening in the market, but it's unlikely any majordecisions are taken," Cardenas told journalists.    Earlier this month, talks in London to re-introduce exportquotas, suspended in February 1986, ended in failure.    Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria, also talking toreporters at the end of the weekly National Coffee Committeemeeting, said the positions of Brazil and of the United Stateswere too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas.    Brazil's coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazilwould not change its coffee policies.    Cardenas said the market situation was getting clearerbecause the trade knew the projected output and stockpilelevels of producers.    He said according to ICO statistics there was a shortfallof nine mln (60-kg) bags on the world market between October,the start of the coffee year, and February. Reuter
COFFEE PRICES BAD NEWS FOR LATIN AMERICA -MINISTER A senior Nicaraguan official said arecent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politicallydisastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries.    Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuencawas in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO)executive board producer members after a meeting last weekendin Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers todiscuss the fall in coffee prices.    London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.    Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failedto agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results onLatin America, both economically and politically.    He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers topave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September.    Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices underan International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year agowhen prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.    Central American economic ministers have estimated theregion will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement,Martinez said.    He said ICO quota talks broke down last month becauseconsumer members lack the political will to fully supportcommodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate toproducers. REUTER

U.S. SEES NO NEW COFFEE AGREEMENT TALKS SOON The United States does not expectthe executive board meeting of the International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, to call for a new round of negotiations onreinstating coffee quotas, a U.S. government official said.    The official, a member of the U.S. delegation to ICO talksearlier this year, said no new coffee agreement talks areexpected because there is no indication the negotiatingpositions of major producers and consumers have changed.    The U.S. still demands, as a condition of reimposition ofcoffee quotas, that "objective criteria" be set forestablishing quotas, said the U.S. official, who asked not tobe identified. Brazil, the major producer, insists on quotasbased on a traditional formula.    The U.S. remains open to a negotiating meeting but only ifsome new flexibility is apparent from major countries, theofficial said.    The ICO executive board meets tomorrow in London. Reuter
ICO BOARD SEEN UNLIKELY TO SET NEW COFFEE TALKS Chances that the International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agreeto resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICOdelegates and trade sources said.    ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries areready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side thatreopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said.    ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight dayswhen producers and consumers failed to reach agreement.     "Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions,it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,"Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must benegotiated sometime, he said.     The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotasbut that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lowerits export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegatessaid.     At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICOboard is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, thereintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and someadministrative matters, according to a draft agenda.    The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president JorioDauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum andchief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending themeeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be anon-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned.    "I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking amongproducers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposalby September (the next scheduled council meeting)," BronwynCurtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said.    Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that adate will be set for an earlier council meeting.    If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect thecoffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for theremainder of its life, to September 30, 1989.    When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largestcoffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one anotherfor sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise.    Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares,under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports,but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for sharesto be redistributed using "objective criteria," which would havethreatened Brazil's share.    At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers,Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put theirobjections as members of the group of eight ICO "dissident"producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline inprices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro MartinezCuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to briefproducers on the Managua meeting.    However, other producers said they were not aware of thismove toward producer solidarity.    London coffee prices closed at 1,276 stg a tonne today,down from around 1,550 at the beginning of March. Reuter
IBC EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN COFFEE EXPORT FORMULA The Brazilian Coffee Institute,IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system whenit reopens export registrations, probably later this week,exporters said.    They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leavethe basic formula for the minimum registration price unchangedbut raise the contribution quota to partially offset theeffects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations wereclosed in mid-February.    To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have tobe around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed.    However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contributionquota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets,and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, theexporters said.    They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contributionquota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnetfunds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteedproducer price.    Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide morefunds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds lastweek, funds are still being released for subsequent approval.    The sources said it is still unclear when registrationswill be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end ofthis week.    "Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentionsknow. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanentlyclosed down," one exporter said.    However, before announcing its export policy the IBC islikely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of theInternational Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board inLondon decides to call a full council meeting to discussreintroduction of export quotas, sources said.    There is also talk of the announcement this week of newmeasures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could beawaiting clarification before making any move, the exporterssaid.    Another factor which could be delaying the opening ofregistrations is the current strike by bank workers which,while not affecting current shipments, could affectdocumentation and currency operations for new sales.    This would certainly be the case if the IBC was consideringobliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two orthree days of registering a sale.
INDIA REDUCES EXPORT DUTY ON COFFEE India cut the export duty on coffeeto 330 rupees per 100 kg from 600 rupees, effective March 23, aCoffee Board official said.    The reduction should help India reach its coffee exporttarget of 90,000 tonnes in fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31,against provisionally estimated exports of 75,000 tonnes in1986/87 and an actual 99,254 tonnes in 1985/86, he said.    India is likely to press for international export quotas ata meeting of coffee producers in London this week because ofdepressed prices, he added.    The International Coffee Organisation, which representsboth consumers and producers, has so far failed to reachagreement on quotas.    India feels it will be useful to have quotas now becausethe slide in prices is unlikely to be halted immediately, hesaid.    Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when marketprices surged after a drought devastated Brazil's coffee crop. REUTER
ICO BOARD PASSES OVER COFFEE QUOTA ISSUE Executive board members of theInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issueof export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here,delegates said.    No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and nofurther discussion on the issue is likely during the three-daytalks, they said.    Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed toagree export quota shares in early March.    Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., thelargest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said.    "The situation is unchanged," consumer spokesman Abraham VanOverbeeke told reporters. "As long as Brazil sticks to itsposition there will not be quotas -- there is no point inmeeting."    At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain itsprevious quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumersand a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistributionof export shares using "objective criteria," which would likelyhave reduced Brazil's share.    Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quotanegotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazilwas willing to give up in early March if the producer proposalwas accepted would no longer be on the table.    "As we said from the start...No agreement, no one millionbags," he told Reuters.    Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the Africanand Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered byAngola, are also no longer valid, delegates said.    The closest the board came to discussing quotas was abriefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recentLatin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said.    There, the producers expressed their political will tonegotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of thedamaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed toagree quotas, Montes said.    The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stockverification. They expected talks on stock verification to takeup the remainder of today's session, delegates said. Reuter
GUATEMALA TO HOST OTHER MILDS COFFEE MEETING Guatemala will host a meeting of othermilds coffee producers probably in May to discuss basic exportquotas, the Guatemalan delegate to the International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, said.    No firm date has been set for the talks, Ambassador ReneMontes told reporters at the ICO executive board meeting here.    Producer countries Brazil, Colombia, and a member ofOAMCAF, the African and Malagasy Coffee Organization, may alsobe invited for consultation, he said.    ICO producers and consumers could not agree on how tocalculate export quota shares at a recent council meeting here.    Other milds coffee producers include Costa Rica, DominicanRepublic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India,Mexico, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea, and Peru. Reuter
ICO COFFEE PRODUCERS TO DISCUSS MARKET SITUATION International Coffee Organization, ICO,producers will meet at 1500 GMT (0900 est) for a generaldiscussion of the market situation, producer spokesmanLindenberg Sette said.    The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested themeeting but Brazil was not among them. The ICO executiveboard's regular session this week has so far been confined toroutine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers torevive export quota negotiations, delegates said.    Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month whenproducers and consumers failed to resolve differences on howquotas should be allocated.    Producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency amongproducers to reopen quota talks with consumers, with mostcountries now prepared to wait for the ICO's annual Septembercouncil session to restart negotiations.    Members of the Inter-African Coffee Organization called fortoday's producer meeting to exchange views on the marketsituation, the producer delegates said.    The lack of a new debate on export quotas here this weekwas cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee pricesin London and New York futures, traders said.    Near May in London hit a five-year low this morning at1,220 stg, about 50 stg below last night's close, they said.    The executive board session looks set to end today,following a final session at 1600 GMT (1000 est) when aconsultancy report of the operation of the ICO will bepresented to producers and consumers, delegates added.

RESTORATION OF COFFEE EXPORT QUOTA Speculation the United States willoffer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to havereached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary ofState George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.

ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY - DELEGATES The restoration of coffee export quotasbefore the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by InternationalCoffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resumenegotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegatestold reporters.    Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening thequota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, theysaid.    Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30pct share of the ICO's global export quota effectivelytorpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotasbefore October, the delegates noted.    Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forcedcoffee futures in London and New York to new lows today,traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr inearly trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said.    Producer delegates said that while the possibility ofreimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, inpractice the idea had effectively been discarded.    The ICO's executive board session here this week has so farbarely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating generalunwillingness to revive talks while chances of success arestill remote, producer delegates said.    Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored,despite the price collapse seen since the failure of lastmonth's negotiations, they said.    "With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants tonegotiate quotas," one leading producer delegate said.    Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season(mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks asinsurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil'scrop.    Many producers are more interested in working towardsreimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system ofquota allocations valid until the International CoffeeAgreement expires in 1989, they said.    Guatemala has already proposed the "other oilds" producergroup should meet in the next two months to begin talks on howto allocate quota shares.    Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quotadistribution system, with some producer delegates reportinggrowing support for a radical reallocation, based on theprinciple of "objective criteria" favoured by consumers.    At last month's council session a splinter group of smallproducers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based onexportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia andthe rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocationsunchanged, except for some temporary adjustments.    A delegate from one of the eight said more producers nowsupported their cause.    The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showedreadiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quotaaccord in October also looked bleak.    The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined tomake reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution ofquota shares based on "objective criteria."    ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would beprepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meetsin September.    Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on externaldebt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee,they said.    They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee exportregistrations might reflect fears this would provoke anotherprice slide and force an emergency ICO council session, whichwould most likely end in failure.    Producers met this afternoon to review the market situationbut had only a general discussion about how furthernegotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said.    Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and thenmay set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are notfixed, he said.    The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local timeto hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The boardmeeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled,delegates said.

Producers met briefly today to exchange views on the marketsituation but there seems little chance discussion on quotaswill begin much before the ICO's annual council session inSeptember, they said.    Delegates earlier thought the meeting would end tonight,but a further session is scheduled tomorrow at 1030 GMT tocomplete reports on stock verification.

NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER New York coffee futures prices willprobably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before aconsolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts.    Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after theInternational Coffee Organization did not place new exportquota discussions on its current agenda.    Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after fiveyears of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February.    "Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents,perhaps 85 cents," said William O'Neill, coffee analyst withElders Futures. "But the additional downside may not be allthat great from current levels."    "At this price level the market is very vulnerable tobullish developments," O'Neill added. "Rather than us having amarket that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode --probably to around 85 cents."    "I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a briefdrop to 85 cents," said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst withPrudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freezein Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor,with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time.    A trader at a major international trade house, who askednot to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term butbelieves if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively highexport price and requires a high contribution quota fromexporters the market could steady at the lower levels.    Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount onBrazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a newinternational agreement could come into force next fall.    Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallenfrom about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lbtoday, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply anddemand.    Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup ofstocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and willneed to do some buying soon.    "Most producing nations have just completed or are about tocomplete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are attheir seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago andwarehouses in producer nations are becoming increasinglyoverburdened," said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for ShearsonLehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report.    Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency toservice foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell,and "this should keep substantial pressure on exporters toundertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows."    Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb beforeBrazil's frost season begins in June.    Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by,though analysts note the peak winter consumption period ispassed and demand usually slows this time of year.    Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as ofJanuary 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bagscompared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdownfor the usually busy winter roasting season.    But Elders O'Neill said, "The roasters are not overstockedby any means."    Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult,given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territorybelow the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and severaltraders said the sidelines might be preferable for the shortterm.

Prices have been falling steadily since the InternationalCoffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreementcontrolling exports by its members, and pressure was renewedthis week as the executive board of the organization met inLondon without reopening debate on its export quotas.    The executive board has limited its current discussions toadministrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday.    Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30dlr a pound in February, when the organization's discussionsaimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down.    Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with ShearsonLehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their highpoint for the year because most producing nations have justcompleted their harvests.    In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced withserious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital.

Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday's USDA report thatfarmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from61.5 mln planted last year.    Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mlnacres of corn, which is down from last year's 76.7 mln acres,but was larger than analysts expected. Reuter
THAI TRADERS OPPOSE REIMPOSITION OF COFFEE QUOTAS Thai coffee exporters said they hopedthe International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimposeexport quotas even though this may lead to a further slump inworld prices.    Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai CoffeeExporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtainedlittle benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented onlyabout 30 pct of its total annual exports.    Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue ifthere are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members whooffer higher prices than non-members, he said.    The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnesof coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.    Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 theprevious year.    However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thaigovernment supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposedICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.    Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the CommercialEconomics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas wouldencourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market,further depressing prices.    He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantialamount of coffee this month without such restrictions. REUTER
KENYAN COFFEE NEEDS RAIN, TRADERS SAY Kenya's late coffee crop is floweringwell, but the main coffee areas were generally dry and hot inthe week ended Wednesday, trade sources said.    "Machakos, Embu, Meru and Kirinyaga in eastern Kenya, andNyeri and Thika in central, have been dry in the past week. Thefarmers expect rain this week. If it does not fall output ofthe late (October-November-December) crop will decline sharply,"one source said.    He said that since most growers did not irrigate their cropthey could do nothing but wait for rain, the main factor whichdetermines Kenyan coffee production.    Two months ago the International Coffee Organization issueda forecast of Kenyan exportable coffee production in the1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season at 1.82 mln bags. REUTER

OTHER MILDS COFFEE PRODUCERS TO MEET MAY 4 Coffee producers belonging to the "OtherMilds" group will meet May 4 in Guatemala to discuss thepossibility of restoring export quotas, producer delegates toldreporters after the closing session of the International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, executive board meeting.    The "Other Milds" group, comprising Costa Rica, DominicanRepublic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India,Mexico, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea and Peru, might consultwith Brazil and Colombia on this meeting, but it was notcertain whether these two countries would attend, they said.    The ICO board meeting ended without moves to restartnegotiations on quotas, which broke down last month, producerdelegates said.    Producers are expected to hold other consultations in thecoming months on how to proceed with quota negotiations, but nodate for a full producer meeting has been mentioned, they said.

COFFEE PRICES SET TO CONTINUE SLIDE - TRADERS Coffee prices look set to continuesliding in the near term, given the lack of progress towards anew International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotaaccord, according to coffee traders and analysts.    Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4-1/2 year lowsyesterday at 1,220 stg per tonne, basis the May position, whenthe lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmedexpectations that efforts to restore quotas would not berevived at this stage, they said.    The 15-day ICO average composite price fell to 99.69 centsa lb for April 1, the lowest for 5-1/2 years.    Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO's annualSeptember council session, and in the interim the Brazilianfrost season from June to August may prove the only bullishfactor to stem further price weakness, they said. Futuresbounced back from the lows today towards the previous tradingrange around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the marketrecovered from yesterday's "confidence blip," one tradercommented.    But despite today's upturn, the overall trend is for lowerprices in the near future, one trade source said.    The market had become increasingly vulnerable toyesterday's shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stgsecond position trading range for 22 successive sessions, hesaid.    Technically the market is more likely to decline further asit absorbs today's brief rally. Steep declines towards the1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a "three figure mentality," andspeculators may elect to push for coffee prices below thepsychological 1,000 stg level, he added.    Some traders said today's upturn was in part due toBrazil's opening last night of May green coffee exportregistrations.     This had been widely anticipated by the market and came asno surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty andlight trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence.    However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test ofsupport at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the onlypossible supportive influence on the horizon being the approachof Brazil's frost season, they said.    Roasters are believed to be well covered, limitingactivities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally nottaking up producer offers, they added.    Central American producers have sold the bulk of theircurrent crops, but robusta producers in West Africa andIndonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment,and this could pressure prices further, traders said.    However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to bebullish, advised caution. "Everybody's bearish now, just as theywere bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg," he said.    Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expresseddoubts the price spiral would continue much below currentlevels. "One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers --there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall."    While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retailprices.    "Its impossible to say, we can't predict anything like thatat this stage," a General Foods spokesman said.    Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway inresponse to market weakness. At the beginning of March theprice of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65stg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue tofall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added.    Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts inthe near future.    "The market seems to have established some equilibrium anddoesn't look set to go much lower," a Nestle spokesmancommented.    Coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, whichfell to a 5-1/2 year low at today's auction at 1.18 stg perkilo for medium quality, traders added. Reuter

GOURMET COFFEE MAKES U.S. SUPERMARKET DEBUT Shoppers who buy Haagen-Daas ice cream,Dijon mustard or Tuborg beer on their weekly trip to thesupermarket are soon to be the target of a promotional blitzfor national-brand "gourmet" coffees.    General Foods, the largest U.S. coffee roaster, and A andP, which shares the third place in the U.S. market, are theonly two national brand roasters so far to introduce thehigher-quality coffees into selected supermarkets.    But industry insiders believe there is substantial growthpotential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales inregular ground roast types.    "I would suspect General Foods will make a name forthemselves with their gourmet line," said a coffee tradesource. "What it could do is really dent the small-store,whole-bean business," the trade source added.    The new lines are designed to appeal to a classicadvertising composite--the "yuppie" consumer.    They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine andwere "first on their block with a wok," as described by KarinBrown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee,called Private Collection out of GF's Maxwell House division.    Paul Gallant, president of A and P's Compass Foodssubsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, describedits potential appeal as "a status thing."    At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it isexpensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold insmall specialty stores. General Foods' Maxwell House Div. hasjust cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrsfor 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate,according to an A and P executive.    Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has "nothing to announce atthis point" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither doesHills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third andfourth size market spot by volume with A and P.    Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress ofGeneral Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the markettakes off.    General Foods and A and P hope their new products will helppush coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption inthe United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales showno signs of picking up.    Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffeequality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing.    "The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the nameof profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers thiswas quality coffee," Gallant said.    As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for thebrew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, "they turnaround and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have aCoke'," he said.    Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who haveconfirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers areaiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd-- the yuppie composite.    "Where else are you going to go?," an industry source said."Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There areno other markets. The only area that's not been promoted isgourmet," he said.    In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmetline could provide much higher margins to roasters than regularground roast coffees produce.    Generally, retail prices are about twice the price ofgreen, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs ofroasting, packaging and distribution, and then deductingoften-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sellcoffee near the trade price as a "loss leader," a productdesigned to draw shoppers into the store.    But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricingstructure prevails, industry sources said. There is no tradediscounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including aspecial valve designed to keep the beans fresher.    Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality greenbeans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmetcoffee are now almost three times the price of green.    Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference.General Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test marketsurveys for Private Collection came back for more.    And product manager Brown points to the success of moreexpensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling inrestricted high income areas and are now available in almostevery supermarket in the country.    A and P is similarly optimistic. "We think we'll doextremely well in the gourmet market," Gallant said.    Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of PrivateCollection in selected high income areas, while A and P offersits 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O'ClockRoyale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore,New York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.

UGANDA PULLS OUT OF COFFEE MARKET - TRADE SOURCES Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB)has stopped offering coffee on the international market becauseit is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.    The board suspended offerings last week but because of itsurgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long itcould sustain, the sources added.    Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have beenwaiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has hadtrouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to theKenyan port of Mombasa.    Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis byholding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings fromcoffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.    The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee moneyand President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penaltyfor such delays, it added.    Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was thatcommercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings-- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in thecurrent coffee year, while the government had asked for 100billion.    The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct ofannual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.    The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's exportearnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows islikely to more than offset an expected increase in production.    CMB officials have forecast that because the government hasrestored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda willproduce over three mln bags of coffee in the year endingSeptember 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

RPT - EUROPEAN TRADE MAY PROPOSE NEW ICO FORMULA European coffee traders and roastersmay propose a new formula for calculating International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meetinghere this week, traders and officials told Reuters.    Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of thepossible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, theworld's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for thenext two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.    "The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil'sattitude, and this compromise could be a solution, " one said.    However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,which began here today and is to continue to the end of theweek, has revealed gaps in the European position onre-introducing quotas.    Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was againstre-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally infavour with the single proviso that there had to be someformula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producingcountries.    The roasters said the positions were generally fairlyclose, and problems with some Government officials.    Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarizedGovernment attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.    Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quotare-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.    "Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by theend of the week to at least present a common European Community(EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of theInternational Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July," one trader said.    "We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that notonly the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,"one official said.    "We have learned that we can live without the quotas thatwere suspended in February last year, but would prefer thestability they can bring to the market as long as we do notsimply return to the old and outdated status quo as far asquota allocation is concerned," he added.    Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on thelikelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildlypessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.    "Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On theconsumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quotare-introduction, " he said.    "The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the newBrazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the leastnegotiable position of any of his predecessors," one tradersaid.    "However, with many producers starting to swing in favour ofthe consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated undera new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, whichgives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quotameeting in September," the official said.

EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA European coffee roasters and tradershave agreed to propose a new formula for calculatingInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch CoffeeTrade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.    Van Horick, who is a council member of the European CoffeeFederation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.    The new formula is based on six-year moving averages andwould give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, anunchanged quota for the remaining two years of the currentcoffee agreement, van Horick said.    If accepted by the consumer and producer members of theICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a newagreement, van Horick said.    Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year whenprices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster inBrazil.    Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers andproducers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.    "Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in theformula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposalleaves it very little to object to," van Horick said.    "The existing quota system is far too rigid and does notreflect supply and demand reality," he said. "Our formulabuilds flexibility into the system and will benefit almosteveryone."    Although full implications of the new formula have still tobe worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such asColombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightlyhigher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, ElSalvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.    Because the proposal provides that future quotadistribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, itshould also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doingso would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.    "If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at leasta fair chance of being accepted by the producers at theSeptember meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of anew quota formula, " van Horick said.    At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.    "Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. Ifthere is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next twomonths and most other producers favour our proposal, we mightjust get an agreement," van Horick added. Reuter
COLOMBIA HELPFUL BUT COFFEE QUOTAS UNCERTAIN--U.S. A U.S. government trade officialresponsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord oncoffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombianefforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.    Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative justback from trade talks in Colombia, said most producingcountries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must beagreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.    "There is one country which evidently still does not,"Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which hasbeen negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.    Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlookfor an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the SeptemberInternational Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.    He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technicaldiscussions with Colombian officials.    While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of theColombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe,Cardenas left a "positive letter," Rosenbaum said.    The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last monthwhich praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formulafor the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concernswith the technical details of the Colombian plan.    Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for commenton a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to byEuropean coffee roasters and traders.    Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horicksaid in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year movingaverages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota forthe remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.    The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotasunless "objective criteria" which reflect recent changes in thecoffee market are used to set export limits. Reuter

BRAZIL COULD EXPORT 19 MLN BAGS OF COFFEE -IBC Brazil's coffee exports could amount to19 mln bags this year, because of the excellent crop estimateof 35.2 mln bags, an IBC spokesman said.    He said exports could surpass the average annual 18 mlnbags mark, especially if the final harvest to be conducted inOctober and November confirms the crop at over 35 mln bags.    He said the average limit of errors for the official cropharvest could be set at five pct above or below the firstestimates officially published today.    He said the IBC agreed with a request by producers for theInstitute to ask the government for a monthly indexation of theguarantee minimum price. Reuter
DAUSTER SAYS CONSUMERS SHOULD KEEP OUT OF QUOTAS Consumer countries should notintervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas,Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said.    "Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands ofproducers as has been traditional," Dauster, a delegate at therecent coffee symposium here, told journalists. "When consumerswant to get involved, talks are much more difficult."    The main consumer country the United States and mainproducer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distributionwhen the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met inFebruary.    Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London inSeptember will be to support the world coffee pact, defend itsmarket share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in thehands of producer countries.    "We have sacrificed a great deal already," he said. "this yearwe have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and weare not in a position to do favours." Reuter
U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED A voluntary compliance system formonitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewedskeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts andtrade sources.    "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because ofthe past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as itbecame a matter of the trade monitoring each other," oneanalyst said.    On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter saidthe Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement avoluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation tomonitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.    Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffeeimporters would voluntarily present needed documents to theU.S. government until Congress approves the monitoringauthority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,it will still be allowed entry.    While many believe producers will not seek to add to theoverburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe somewill ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu ofmonitoring controls, trade sources said.    "Last time, there was a lot of false information submittedto customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," aU.S. Customs spokesman said.    "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but whenits hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demandForm O (documents tracking merchandise from source todestination)," he said.    Many see it as a true test of whether producers andimporters will abide by the quota system.    "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in thequota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster.     "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade didnot act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "withoutthe need to submit documents, the ball will be in theproducers' hands."    Some feel that importers will take advantage of thevoluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-membercountries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falselylabelled.    According to customs officials, several green coffeeimporters confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffeefraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navybeans.    "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices forone country and another, producers may be teted to get rid oftheir stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and bycircumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analystBernie Savaiko.    Still, others believe that producers will not be hardpressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation inthe U.S. in the near term.    "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would nothave some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary systemseemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have somuch coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of athreat," one trader said.

IBC SEEKS EXPORT DETAILS TO SET COFFEE QUOTAS The Brazilian Coffee Institute(IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday tosubmit details of past export performance in order thatindividual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.    He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmedacceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposalsto establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on exportperformance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.    Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutivemonths between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to beused for calculating the export performace portion.    The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippersparticipation and use this as a basis for allocation ofindividual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.    He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao PauloMercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate.Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payableon coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add thispremium to the contribution quota when he submits his exportsales declaration form.    Auctions will not start until after the opening of exportregistrations. The spokesman could not say when this might bebut trade sources said an announcement could come at the end ofthe week, opening registraions from Monday.    A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of theCNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system forallocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels,the spokesman added.    A system of individual export quotas is being reestablishedin Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensureshipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota. Reuter

UGANDA PLANS TO EXPORT ROASTED COFFEE TO EUROPE Uganda plans to export roasted coffee toEurope by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.    A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry ofIndustry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grindand pack local coffee for export. Construction will start inDecember and the factory should be ready by next October.    He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the CoffeeMarketing Board to supply his company <Unipack> with 24,000tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi alsotold reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loanfrom the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris.    Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, andexpects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.    Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefitUganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln(60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under thelatest International Coffee Agreement.    In addition, the value of roasted coffee should besubstantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.    The U.S. Is the biggest buyer of Ugandan coffee, most ofwhich is used to produce instant coffee. REUTER
