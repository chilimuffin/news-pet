CANADA GDP RISES 3.1 PCT IN 1986 Canada's real gross domestic product,seasonally adjusted, rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of1986, the same as the growth as in the previous quarter,Statistics Canada said.    That left growth for the full year at 3.1 pct, which isdown from 1985's four pct increase.    The rise was also slightly below the 3.3 pct growth rateFinance Minister Michael Wilson predicted for 1986 inFebruary's budget. He also forecast GDP would rise 2.8 pct in1987.    Statistics Canada said final domestic demand rose 0.6 pctin the final three months of the year after a 1.0 pct gain inthe third quarter.    Business investment in plant and equipment rose 0.8 pct inthe fourth quarter, partly reversing the cumulative drop of 5.8pct in the two previous quarters. Reuter

CANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY Canadian economic growth is expected toslow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture shouldkeep the country from recession, economists said.    "The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growthover the course of 1987," said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist atDominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.    Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,but down from 1985's four pct.    In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualizedrates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in thethird quarter.    "Essentially it is a flat performance," said Warren Jestin,deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.    Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt ThomsonBongard Inc said "it shows the economy is not moving along verysteadily, it's not a very promising number."    "We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarterin Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession," sheadded.    The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast byFederal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget lastmonth. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct thisyear.    Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth willlikely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.    Statistics Canada also reported the country's tradeperformance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit inthe current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrsfrom the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.    "The sharp increase in the deficit originated frommerchandise trade transactions where imports continued toadvance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged," thefederal agency said in a statement.    The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billiondlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.    But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, andhelp fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct ofCanada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year. Reuter
CANADA CENTRAL BANK HEAD SEES MODERATE GROWTH Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said heexpects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the comingyear, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of1986.    "We see moderate growth," Crow told a news conferencefollowing presentation of the central bank's annual report inthe House of Commons today.    He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy,particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourthquarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domesticproduct expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.    Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements thatinflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policyand said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada'sinflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.    The governor said Canada's banking system remains sounddespite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks indebt plagued countries such as Brazil.    "It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but Ithink it can be overplayed in terms of its impact," Crow toldreporters. Reuter
GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT The outlook for the WestGerman economy is relatively bright, with gross nationalproduct expected to expand by three pct this year, KielUniversity's Institute for World Economy said.    The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leadingeconomic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimisticthan that of the other institutes, some of which have recentlyreduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.    In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's exportoutlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark'sstrength against the dollar and other major currencies.    "The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all inall, limited," the report said. "On the contrary, a slight risein exports can be expected."    The institute said past experience has shown West Germanexporters will move to counterbalance currency factors bycutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjustingtheir product ranges.    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise ineconomic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, thedecline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slowthis year.    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewedadvances in domestic consumption and investment spending, bothof which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetarypolicy, the institute said.    However, it said the labour market would see only a slightimprovement because companies will be reluctant to hireadditional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly byagreed reductions in working hours.    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance ofmonetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a markedacceleration of inflation.    It also warned that what it called the worldwidesynchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a newglobal recession. It said central banks in industrializedcountries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the FederalReserve Board's expansionary course.    The institute said this in turn was bound to leadeventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central bankswere likely to follow suit, causing a recession that couldaggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well asincrease protectionism around the world.    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from thenegative effects of the global synchronization of monetarypolicy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces ofgrowth at home.    The institute said this could be done by ensuring thatfiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxesshould be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, andwage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower thanin 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationarypressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supplyto about four pct. REUTER

GERMAN 1988 TAX CUTS RAISED BY 5.2 BILLION MARKS Senior officials in the West Germancoalition government said tax cuts planned for next year wouldbe increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge madeby Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month'sinternational monetary conference in Paris.    Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian SocialUnion Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference alsoattended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union andFree Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billionmark reduction would represent net tax relief.    An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.    The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cutsalready planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.    Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax reliefwould be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginalincrease in income tax.    An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whosechildren are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from thetax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for byincreasing the level of special depreciations for small- andmedium-sized companies.    The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part ofa general reform of the tax system which will come into effectin 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of thisreform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, wouldbe introduced next year, ahead of schedule.    The West German government had come under pressure from theUnited States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. ButStoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, whilethe economy would continue to expand this year, the rate ofgrowth was uncertain.    The government said in January it was aiming for realgrowth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but someeconomists have revised their predictions down to two or below.    Stoltenberg said: "We remain on a course of expansion.Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe,or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer tothree pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a fewdays ago, remains open at the moment."

WORLD BANK REPORT CRITICISES PERU ECONOMIC PLAN a confidential world bank report on theperuvian economy said the government's strategy does not offergood prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely toquickly lead to inflation.    The report, published today by an economic monthly, theperu report, said the success of president alan garcia'sgovernment in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pctgross domestic product growth "represents gains in the shortterm at the expense of the long."    Government officials had no immediate comment on thereport, which advised a reduction in the overall size of thepublic investment programme and greater emphasis on thepreservation of peru's export potential.    The report said that although the government had succeededin cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 tounder 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation programme wasencountering increasing difficulties.    "an early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked tomonetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing ofprice controls, appears not improbable," it added.
MINISTERS FEEL EC FORECASTS TOO PESSIMISTIC European Community finance ministersdiscussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and manysaid a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was toopessimistic.    The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks agocut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.    It said economic prospects had been less promising over thepast few months because of a sharp fall in the value of thedollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which wouldrestrain Community exports.    But diplomats said several member states, led by WestGermany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy,especially since it was drafted before a recent agreementbetween the leading Western economic powers to stabilisecurrencies around current levels.    "Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rathertoo pessimistic," said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens,who chaired the meeting.    The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for WestGermany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear itfeels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures tostimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe.    But two top German officials, State Secretaries OttoSchlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need atthe moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy.    The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France,while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission's viewthat Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth.

GERMAN BANKS SAY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMY GROWING Uncertainty is growing about the prospectsfor the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scaleback investment plans, the German Savings Banks and GiroAssociation said.    Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, whileindustry is less optimistic than it was, the association saidin a report.    However, last month's agreement among the six leadingwestern industrialized countries to keep currencies aroundpresent levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence forexporters, it added.    The banking association said the possibility of usingmonetary policy to stimulate the economy should not beoverestimated.    Another small drop in already low interest rates could notbe expected to cause any significant rise in purchases ofconsumer or capital goods, it said.    The Bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount andLombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope forany further monetary moves, the association added.    On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said grossnational product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendaradjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with thethird quarter.    The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNPin the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relativelyweak.    Bank economists have forecast the economy will eitherstagnate or contract slightly in the first quarter. Officialfirst-quarter figures are due in early June. REUTER
U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT Senior U.S. Economic officialsdisagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budgetdeficit reduction targets.    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of EconomicAdvisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition toa tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cuttingspending and fostering economic growth.    By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the CongressionalBudget Office, said the budget process has broken down and thedeficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.    Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York Universitythat spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on thedesire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibilityfor local projects to state governments.    He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows thePresident to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, tolimit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions shouldbe linked more closely.    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pctgrowth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and3.5 pct in 1988.    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate ofeconomic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, "It looks prettygood to me. We've had two very strong employment reports."    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,"It looks like they're on track."    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the taxreform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and willgreatly increase private production incentives, he said.    "Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggestnational net output of goods and services will permanentlyincrease by approximately two pct because of the long-runconsequences of tax reform," Sprinkel said. "In 1986, this wouldhave amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in theincome of the average American family."    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsiblefor the large increase in the budget deficit.    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amountedto 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct ofGNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage pointshigher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.    "Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budgetdeficits of the past few years," Sprinkel said.    "This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced taxincreases that occurred between 1978 and 1981," he added.    However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Pennerargued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.    "Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxesenormously without any plan to decrease spending by theAdministration or Congress, indeed with increases in defencespending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)are unpleasant," he said.    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideologicalturmoil in the U.S. Caused by the "biggest sustained inflationin our nation's history," which helped foster widespreaddistrust of government.    "The American people turned on the government with taxrevolt at the state level and new demands on the government atthe national level," Penner said.    "But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislikeof spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistakedemands that the system change a lot."    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budgetdeficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit willremain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily isnot likely to succeed.    "I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries todictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simplybecause there's no ... Way to enforce it," Penner said.    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budgetdeficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminatedby one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxesrelated to tax reform and sales of government assets.    "Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creativetiming changes, like moving the military payday from the lastday of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That savedmore than two billion dlrs," Penner said. REUTER
BELGIUM REVISES DOWN 1987 GNP GROWTH FORECASTS The Belgian government has lowered itsforecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in1987 to 3.5 pct from an originally forecast 3.9 pct, PrimeMinister Wilfried Martens said in a statement to parliament.    He said this revision, which brings government forecastsmore closely into line with those by private institutions,takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economyand international trade.    But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will belimited due to recent agreements on wages and workingconditions agreed by employers and unions.    Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP togrow in volume terms.    However, last month the government's Planning Bureau saidit had revised its 1987 forecast for this to 0.9 pct from 2.0pct.

BANKS SEE GERMAN GROWTH OF AT LEAST TWO PCT External risks for the economy haveincreased, but growth of two to 2.5 pct this year is stillpossible, according to President of the West German Federationof Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth.    Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the furtherfall of the dollar since the start of this year and therevaluation of the mark against European currencies meant WestGerman exporters were facing a "rough wind."    However, domestic demand was continuing to rise and privateconsumption in particular would support the economy, he said.He saw good prospects for consumer industries.    Schroeder-Hohenwarth said economic policy now had toconcentrate on strengthening this domestic growth. In thiscontext, he welcomed a decision by the government to increasethe scope of tax cuts due in 1988.    He added, a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduledfor 1990, which was worked out by coalition partners thismonth, was an "important step in the right direction."    The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from56 pct. However, Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cutthe maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was"rather half-hearted." REUTER
BELGIAN GOVERNMENT TO CUT FINANCIAL REQUIREMENT Belgian Prime Minister WilfriedMartens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987government financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs.    He said this will enable the requirement to be held to419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product.    Martens said following a lowering of government estimatesof 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by governmentdepartments of 1987 spending, the government calculated thatunless action was taken, the requirement would exceed thetarget by 22.5 billion francs.    Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receiptsby 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion.The remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised throughtreasury operations.    Martens said the money is being found through a series ofsmall economies and confirmed that it includes the raising oftwo billion francs through the sale of part of the government's50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz.    Last year, the government announced a major programdesigned to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs.    The program was designed to get Belgium out of what thegovernment said was a "snowball effect" under which thegovernment constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficitswhich were due largely to the cost of servicing and repayingexisting debt.    In 1986, the government financing requirement is estimatedat 561 billion francs or 11.0 pct of GNP. REUTER

The rise in the July/September quarter had originally beenput at 0.6 pct. The annualized growth rate accelerated to 3.2pct in October/December from 3.0 pct in July/September.    In the 1986 calendar year, GNP rose 2.5 pct, after a 4.7pct increase in 1985. Last year's performance was the worstsince 1974, when GNP fell 1.4 pct. Agency officials blamed thestrong yen for depressing exports and manufacturing industry.    In nominal terms, GNP rose 0.5 pct in the October/Decemberquarter, reflecting stable prices, after a one pct increase inthe previous three months, the Agency said.    Domestic real demand increased 0.6 pct in October/December,after a one pct rise the previous quarter.    Domestic demand contributed 0.5 percentage point to realGNP growth in October/December, while foreign trade added 0.2.The figures do not tally exactly due to rounding.    In July/September, domestic demand contributed onepercentage point to GNP growth while foreign trade knocked off0.3 point.

Total export volume fell 1.2 pct quarter on quarter inOctober/December. Imports also fell, by 2.9 pct.    Of the 0.5 point contribution of domestic demand toOctober/December GNP growth, the private sector accounted for0.4 point and the public sector, 0.2.

ZIMBABWE GDP RISES 0.2 PCT IN 1986 Zimbabwe's real gross domestic productincreased 0.2 pct in 1986, according to preliminary figurespublished by the Central Statistical Office (CSO). Thiscontrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985.    The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth wasa drop in the real value of agricultural output. This declined12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previousyear. Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturingproduction increased 1.4 pct.    The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 12.7 pct to8.2 billion Zimbabwe dlrs, but inflation, measured by the GDPdeflator, was estimated at 12.2 pct, so there was virtually nogrowth in real output during 1986.

ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD The Japanese economy will remain sluggishin the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for12 years in 1986, private economists said.    Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand,was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing andbusiness investment would help sustain the economy this year,the economists said.    They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agencyreport today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Decquarter for the first time in 12 years.    The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in theprevious quarter.    It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worstperformance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wakeof the first oil crisis.    They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline inconsumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it wasonly temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather haddepressed retail sales.    But most private economists disagreed and said consumerswere likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they sawtheir real income level off.    "Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes orheating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, butthey have done so because they have become even more uneasyabout their future pay rises," said Shoji Saito, general managerof Mitsui Bank's economic research division.    He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries, particularly those hithard by the yen's rise.    Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, saidweakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor.Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achievedomestically generated economic growth as the government hasput a lid on fiscal measures, he said.    Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered inOct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, includingexceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. JohsenTakahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute,said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Decresulted from an issue of gold coins.    "This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect thathigh level of public-sector consumption in the followingquarter," Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spendingwould have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, whichmarked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign.    Takahashi said the economy might contract in the currentquarter given the lack of additional significant governmentspending and sluggish consumer spending.    Saito said the most effective government action would beincome tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of aproposed controversial sales tax. REUTER

He said the Treasury expected a current account balance ofpayments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1billion shortfall in 1986.    Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of thisyear, Lawson said.    "As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation maycontinue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct bythe summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of theyear," he added.    Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR),Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.    On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range forthe narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal1987/88.    No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3aggregate, he said. "But broad money will continue to be takeninto account in assessing monetary conditions, as of coursewill the exchange rate," the Chancellor told Parliament.    Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 "ischiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil taxrevenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by anincreasingly profitable business sector in particular."    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlierassumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs perbarrel in calendar 1987.    He said "it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil taxrevenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of theeconomy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts thepublic finances in a very strong position."    Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at1.0 pct of GDP in future.    "We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium TermFinancial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the yearsahead," Lawson said.    "Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have thisyear for reducing the burden of taxation, which of courseremains a major objective of government policy."    "But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudenceand caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future."    Lawson said the time had come to strike the ExchangeControl Act from the Statute book.    On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchangedat 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will becharged at the "appropriate corporation tax rate."    He said that under the new proposed system, companiesshould be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) paymentsagainst tax on capital gains.    "Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in1988/89," Lawson said.    Lawson said he will propose that all companies and buildingsocieties be treated the same way on payment of corporationtax, "with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months afterthe end of the accounting period on which the tax is due."    "I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a newmethod of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay andFile."    This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining taxcollection, and would not come into force until the early1990s.    Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax(PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pctof the costs of developing certain new fields set against their(PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of thosenew fields exceeds the costs incurred.    Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spendingon research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to anyparticular field.    On business employment, Lawson said employers will receivetax relief for retraining workers.    Lawson said that in future, traders registered for ValueAdded Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the taxon the basis of cash paid and received.    Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead ofquarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was beingextended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholdsare to be raised to 21,300 stg.    New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added.    The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now beset at 125,000 stg.    Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companiesin multinational groups with dual residence will no longer beable to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment.The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but "genuinetrading companies" will not be affected.    He also planned to end the present treatment of tax creditrelief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bankloans, also from April 1.    "In future, banks will be able to offset this tax creditonly against tax on the profit on the relevant loan," he said.    The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by twopence, to 27 pct from 29 pct.    Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basictaxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added "given my decisionto use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have toreduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget."    Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to27 pct, he said.    On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned tochange the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing itinto line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilitiesmade by ordinary insurance companies and of comparableprovisions made by financial traders.    The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently withLloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said.    "The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for theLloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year," Lawsonsaid. MORE
BELGIAN BANK SAID TO SEE SLOWER GROWTH An internal report produced by theBelgian National Bank foresees the country's gross nationalproduct growth falling in 1987 to 1.0 pct from 2.3 pct in 1986,the independent newspaper Le Soir said.

U.S. REAL GNP ROSE 1.1 PCT IN FOURTH QUARTER The U.S. Gross National Product,after removing the impact of inflation, increased at a revisedannual rate of 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter, the CommerceDepartment said.    That was down from an earlier preliminary 1.3 pct riseestimated a month ago and down from the 2.1 pct rise in thefourth quarter of 1985.    The final fourth quarter revision, however, left unchangedthe previous estimate of a 2.5 pct increase in GNP for all of1986 over 1985.

AUSTRALIAN FOURTH QTR GDP RISES 1.1 PCT, AFTER 0.2 PCT THIRD QTR RISE - O Australia's seasonally adjusted realgross domestic product (GDP) rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarterof 1986 after rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter, theStatistics Bureau said.    This compares with a 1.1 pct fall in the fourth quarter of1985.    Compared with the year-earlier quarter, GDP also rose 1.1pct, the Bureau figures show.    The annual rise compares with a 0.3 pct fall in the thirdquarter compared with the 1985 third quarter and a 4.3 pct risein the year-earlier period, the Bureau figures show.    Real non-farm gross product rose 0.9 pct in the fourthquarter after zero growth in the third quarter and a 1.3 pctfall a year earlier, making an annual rise of 0.8 pct.    Gross farm product rose 4.3 pct compared with rises of 2.6pct in the third quarter and 2.8 pct a year earlier, makingannual growth of 6.6 pct.    Elements in the fourth quarter GDP rise included falls of0.6 pct and 0.2 pct in private and government final consumptionexpenditure respectively, the Bureau figures show.    Gross fixed capital expenditure fell 0.1 pct in the quarterwhile exports of goods and services rose 13.0 pct and imports2.9 pct.

NO FRENCH REFLATION, SOURCES CLOSE TO BALLADUR SAY There is no question of stimulatingconsumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or otherreflationary policies to boost the French economy, sourcesclose to finance minister Edouard Balladur said.    Their comments followed remarks by prime minister JacquesChirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministerswere agreed on the desirability of "relaunching" the economy.    This sparked speculation the government was preparing for areflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruledout any such move.    The sources today said the government's policy remained oneof "recovery," or sound finances and greater efficiency.    They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion francrevenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisationprogram will go to providing public companies with freshcapital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go towardpaying off national debt.    Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30billion would be distributed between repayment of nationalinternal debt and public companies in similar proportions, theyadded.    The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation whenthe country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct thisyear from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice asfast as gross domestic product.    Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct thisyear from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line withearlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.    The sources said that with France's economic targets for1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, thegovernment had no intention of pushing the economy to grow atan artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.

FRENCH INSTITUTE PESSIMISTIC ON 1987 GROWTH French gross domestic product will growby only 1.5 pct in real terms this year, compared with thegovernment's forecast of two to 2.5 pct growth, the privateInstitut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour leDeveloppement des Entreprises (IPECODE) said.    However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986level of two pct.    IPECODE said demand and production would develop inparallel this year, in contrast to last year when productionwas unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domesticdemand, unleashing higher import demand.    Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals infrancs by member nations, and an increase in reserves ofSpecial Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment ofFrench debts.    Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund(FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs.    French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct lastyear, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pctin 1988, it added.    Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct thisyear and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986.    Inflation, which was running at 2.1 pct at the end of 1986,is likely to rise to 2.9 pct at the end of this year, IPECODEsaid, while the government has forecast 2.5 pct.    However, the institute said inflation would fall back to2.5 pct at the end of 1988, "provided that real wage costsremain within the framework of productivity rises." REUTER
U.K. AVERAGE GDP RISES 2.6 PCT IN 1986 Britain's gross domestic product (GDP)on the average basis of output, expenditure and income rose by2.6 pct in 1986 after a 3.4 pct increase a year earlier,Central Statistical Office (CSO) preliminary figures show.    In the fourth quarter, GDP rose 0.7 pct over the previousquarter and was up 3.3 pct on the same 1985 quarter.    The average estimate index, seasonally-adjusted and based1980, was set at 114.3 in the fourth quarter of 1986 against113.5 in the previous quarter and 110.7 in the final quarter of1985.

On the output measure, GDP rose an upward revisedseasonally adjusted 0.3 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 to114.9 on the output index from 114.5 in the previous quarter,giving a 3.2 pct rise over the fourth 1985 quarter, the CSOfigures show.    On income-based GDP, the index in the fourth quarter roseby 0.7 pct from the third quarter and was up 3.8 pct on theyear-ago quarter.    The indices stood at 115.3, 114.4 and 111.0 respectively.    Expenditure-based GDP rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter of1986 from the third quarter and was up 2.9 pct from the same1985 quarter.    The CSO set the expenditure index at 112.9 from 111.6 inthe third quarter of 1986 and 109.8 in the final 1985 quarter.    The year-on-year rise for expenditure GDP was 2.3 pct withthe expenditure index for the whole of 1986 set at 111.9against 109.4 a year earlier.    For income GDP, the year-on-year rise was 2.6 pct againstagainst three pct a year earlier. The ouptut GDP measure rose2.8 pct year-on-year, down from 3.8 pct in 1985.    The government usually considers the output measure themost reliable way of measuring short-term GDP changes.    It is based on output data for production industry andpartial information for the rest of the economy.    The government had forecast that average measure GDP wouldrise 2.5 pct in calendar 1986 after 3.3 pct in 1985. The budgetunveiled on Tuesday foresaw GDP growth in 1987 of three pct.

Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood,machinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups.Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobilesand parts, however.

OECD SEES MAJOR ADJUSTMENT FOR AUSTRALIA Australia faces a major medium termadjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance,the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development saidin its latest annual review of the Australian economy.    It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising externaldebt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs andinflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECDcountries.    A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basisfor sustained non-inflationary growth and externalcompetitiveness had improved, but economic performance overallhad sharply deteriorated since June 1985.    A major shift of real resources to the external sector --about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for theeconomy to expand in line with potential, for employment togrow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said.    Success depended on the setting of right policies includingtighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sectorborrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour.    Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expectedeconomic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighterfiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement intrade volumes.    It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored,the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct ofGDP by the first half of next year, while inflation wasprojected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct bymid-1988.    Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintainthe competitive edge created by the Australian dollar'sdepreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares inorder to encourage business investment.    The report urged Australia to broaden its export base bydeveloping viable and competitive service and manufacturingindustries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets tocorrect its external imbalances.    It added Australia should reduce protection levels inmanufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would nodoubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry. REUTER

SPAIN REVISES ECONOMIC TARGETS FOR 1987 Spain has revised some of its maineconomic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of theeconomy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in itsmonthly bulletin.    Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against aprevious target of 3.5 pct.    Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the centralbank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing atan annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to fourpct if the government were to meet its five pct inflationtarget this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.    The forecast for private consumption growth remainsunchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revisedupwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.    Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected toincrease by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.    Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against thedollar and slack external demand.    Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spendinghas lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from anearlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.    The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast tofive pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts lastweek on whether this target could be maintained if wagesettlements continue to rise above the government's recommendedfive pct ceiling.    Unions and employers dispute the average wage increasesagreed so far this year.

MARCH U.S. PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX UP AT 53.9 The U.S. economy in March improved at afaster rate than in February, with the National Association ofPurchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from51.9 pct, the NAPM said.    The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct.The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for therest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross nationalproduct growth of about three pct.    An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that theeconomy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies adeclining economy.    The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in allof the indicators in the index except inventories, whichdeclined slightly.    New orders rose sharply in March, with production alsohigher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economyimproved in March. Employment expanded for the first time sinceAugust 1984.    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business surveycommittee and director of materials management at Pitney BowesInc <PBI> said "the economy ended the first quarter with ahealthy, if not substantial improvement."    Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders inMarch assures a good beginning for the second quarter.    Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that theywere paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Ofthose paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at2.5 pct.    The estimated average price increase anticipated by membersfor the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue torise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them asbeing significant.    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, basedon five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.    The monthly report is based on questions asked ofpurchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies. Reuter
SOUTH KOREA'S 1987 GNP SEEN GROWING NINE PCT South Korea's gross national product (gnp)is forecast to grow by nine pct in 1987, surpassing thegovernment's original forecast of eight pct and against a 12.5pct rise in 1986, an Economic Planning Board report said.    The report reviewing the country's economy in the firstthree months of this year said year-on-year gnp wasprovisionally estimated to have grown by about 12 pct in theperiod, against a 10.5 pct growth in the same 1986 period.    Board officials said the gnp rise in the January-Marchperiod is due largely to increased exports, which totalled 9.34billion dlrs against 6.9 billion a year earlier. REUTER
GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS The global economy is expected toweaken this year, adding new worries to an already seriouspoverty outlook, economic analysts said.    For finance ministers and central bankers attending thisweek's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fundand World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add anadditional concern.    The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pctthis year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.    In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, ameasure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.    For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0pct from 3.5 pct last year.    The new figures are considered a major disappointment tothe poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in theindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oilprices would assist their economic recovery and help them copewith growing mounds of debt.    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believedthe industrial country economies would move up to an annualgrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for sometime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning intoan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthierstates for markets for their products as well as financialassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' economies poses fundamental worries.    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, haveonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,including the key one of exports.    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but ittoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only2.3 pct, according to the IMF.    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, theUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany toignite their economies but with little apparent success.    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar andthe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. tradedeficit.    Reagan administration officials have been saying that theimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been muchslower than expected.    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that "it hasto be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time towork through to payments flows -- probably at least three yearsto get a resonably complete effect."    The report added, however, "the adjustments may take evenmore time on this occasion."REUTER^M
WEST GERMAN INSTITUTES CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS The five leading West German economicresearch institutes said the government should do more tostimulate economic growth and called for early introduction oftax cuts planned for 1990.    In their joint spring report the institutes were dividedabout 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pctexpansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross nationalproduct grew 2.4 pct last year.    But the report said all the institutes believed that "moremust be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additionaljobs can be created."    The institutes said any step which improved basic economicconditions should be taken as quickly as possible. "From thispoint of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should bebrought forward."    The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billionmarks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief fromthe tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.    However, the institutes criticised the government, not onlyfor the timing of the reform, but also because the question ofits financing had been left open.    The government has not specified how the remaining 19billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.    The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn hadcaused uncertainty among companies and households as to whatexactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged aquick decision from the government.    They also said the government should reduce taxpreferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged arestriction of state spending and called for no increase invalue-added tax.    The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasingsubsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.    They referred specifically to a doubling of specialwritedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in apackage of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described thisas an increase in subsidies.    The institutes said total subsidies, including taxpreferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risenfurther since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, itshould be possible "despite ... Major political difficulties" tofinance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.    The institutes said that if the government raised valueadded tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of thepositive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.    The report also noted that the government was progressingonly slowly with its plans to privatise state companies andsaid more deregulation was needed. The government had to aimfor more competition, it said. REUTER
BANGEMANN REJECTS CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS West German Economics Minister MartinBangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country's leadingeconomic research institutes for early introduction of a majortax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.    In a statement reacting to the five institutes' jointspring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call forbringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --    "The government points out that the positive effects forgrowth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budgetdeficit) must not be allowed to be endangered."    Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts plannedfor 1988 had already been increased.    Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987,with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pctgrowth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.    Bangemann said "The government, agreeing with the majority,sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate forexports expressed by the minority."    He said there was reason to believe that export demandwould start to rise in the course of the year, partly becauseof a further increase in world trade. REUTER

INSTITUTES SEE NO WEST GERMAN RECESSION The five leading West German economicresearch institutes, which have revised down their forecastsfor 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in West Germany,their spokesman, Hans-Juergen Schmahl said.    The institutes were divided in their spring report onforecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth andtwo seeing only one pct expansion. Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.    Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said,"None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with thebeginning of a recession." He added, however, that exportsremained the weak point of the economy .    Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect furtherencroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.    Arthur Krumper of Munich's Ifo institute, which with theDIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view ofthe economy, said, "The braking effects (on the economy)produced by external factors will remain considerable for mostof the year."

THAI CABINET APPROVES SEVEN PCT BUDGET INCREASE The Thai Cabinet approved a seven pctincrease in the national budget for fiscal 1987/88 startingnext October, compared with a 6.2 pct increase for the currentyear ending September, a government spokesman said.    He told reporters the budget, to be presented to Parliamentby late next month or in early June, calls for spending of243.5 billion baht against 227.5 billion this year.    The new budget is intended to make Thailand's GrossDomestic Product grow by at least five pct during the yearwithout compromising its conservative fiscal and monetarypolicy, the spokesman said.    "The budget is in line with our policy to stimulate theeconomy and to achieve a stable growth while we continuemaintaining our current cautious fiscal policy," he said.    The spokesman said the budget provides for a 9.6 pctincrease in fresh government investment expenditure to 39.8billion baht, up from 36.3 billion this year.    Government revenue is projected to grow 7.5 pct to 199.5billion baht against 185.5 billion targetted for 1986/87.    He said the budget contains a 44 billion baht deficit, orabout 3.4 pct of GDP, compared with 42 billion or 3.5 pctplanned for this year.  The deficit is required by Thai laws tobe financed by domestic borrowings.    The finalised budget bill earmarks 59.8 billion baht, or24.6 pct of total expenditure, for servicing the government'sdomestic and foreign debt, up from 56 billion and a similar24.6 pct this year.

EC MINISTERS LIKELY TO CRITICISE FINANCE IDEAS Plans for a new-style EuropeanCommunity (EC) free of damaging budget wrangles receive theirfirst full review from EC foreign ministers today, but areunlikely to gather much support.    Diplomats said key EC capitals would voice strong criticismof proposals that would lead to a sharp increase in EC budgetpayments by bringing member states" contributions more into linewith national wealth.    They said the EC"s current paymasters, Britain, France, andWest Germany, would lead the opposition to the plans, designedto enable the community meet the challenges of the 1990s.    Faced with a budget deficit this year of at least fivebillion dlrs, EC Commission President Jacques Delors called inFebruary for a radical overhaul of the EC financing system.    Such action was necessary, he argued, to end a damagingcycle of annual budget crises and ensure cash for technologicalresearch programs and regional and social spending projects.    Ironically, diplomats said, the move could spark exactlythe type of row it was intended to avoid with industriallydeveloped northern states demanding assurances the new cashwould not be swallowed up by the poorer southern members.    Delors" plans, by linking a country"s contributions to itsGross National Product (GNP), would over the next five yearsadd some 18 billion dlrs to the present budget of 34 billion.    Currently, contributions are calculated on a percentage ofValue Added Tax (VAT) returns.    Under the new scheme, all countries would pay one pct oftheir VAT receipts to Brussels. Extra cash would then be raisedin line with needs by a levy on the difference between acountry"s total VAT receipts and its GNP.    London is one of the most resolutely opposed countries tothe scheme, arguing instead that money should be made availablefrom deep cutbacks in the EC"s heavily-subsidised farm sector.    Unofficially many EC capitals secretly support thewearisome budget wrangling, taking the line that the highlydiverse 12-nation Community can only take tough decisions whenforced to do so.    The issue is further complicated by a possible generalelection in Britain and acceptance that the EC problems cannotseriously be addressed by London until those polls are out ofthe way. REUTER

SRI LANKAN MINISTER SEES SLOWEST GROWTH IN DECADE Civil strife in Sri Lanka willmake the economy's growth rate in 1987 its slowest in a decade,Sri Lankan finance minister Ronnie de Mel said here.    He told Reuters in an interview that he expected grossdomestic product to expand by only four pct in 1987. He said itaveraged five pct over the past three years.    For the first two years after the present troubles began in1983, production of key commodities like tea, rubber, coconutsand rice kept up, he said.    Tamils on the island are fighting for a seperate state.    De Mel said: "Private sector production in fact grew by 25pct in 1984 and 20 pct in 1985. But last year things took aturn for the worse."    He said prices of tea, the main export, fell to half their1984 levels. World prices of rubber and copra also fell.    "There was also a decline in income from tourism andremittances from Sri Lankans working in the Middle East."    He said any savings from the worldwide drop in crude oilprices were wiped out by the cut in commodity earnings.    "To add to all this we have had, between January and Marchthis year, the worst drought I have seen in my life," he said.    De Mel said the drought would seriously affect agriculturalproduction.    He said because of the fighting in the country, defenceexpenditure was now about 20 pct of the national 1987 budget of70 billion rupees.    Sri Lanka planned to borrow about 600 mln dlrs in 1987 fromthe World Bank and the Sri Lanka Aid Consortium which comprisesmembers of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD), he said.    "We also plan to ask the International Monetary Fund foranother 200 mln dlrs through a structural adjustment facilityand a compensatory financing facility to balance our exportrevenue cuts," de Mel said.    He said despite the unrest, Sri Lanka had succeeded inkeeping its total foreign debt to three billion dlrs byavoiding borrowing from commercial banks.    "Commercial bank debt accounts for only 15 pct of our totalforeign debt," he said.    He said the Mahaweli hydro-electric project was nearingcompletion. It was likely to cut dependence on oil imports.    "The project will more than treble our hydro-electric powerfrom 300 megawatts to nearly 1,000 megawatts," de Mel said.    He said 20 new townships would rise around the project,which is in the north-central part of the island. It wasexpected to irrigate 1.2 mln acres of land and indirectlyprovide employment for 500,000 landless families.

CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET The Philippines' first quarter growthfigures released yesterday indicated the government was likelyto achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor JoseFernandez said in an interview.    The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pctand gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarterfrom a year earlier.    "I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it(growth) short," Fernandez said.     NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in thefourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNPgrowth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.    "Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resourcesand if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume thatdomestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated andwould not be a stumbling block," Fernandez said.    "I think even before the figures came out, simply looking atkey indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,showed that the economy was on a different track from lastyear," he said.    Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in thefirst and second quarters because of the dry weather, and itcould drop off in the third quarter.    He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in themanufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.    "That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular," he said.    He said the government had met all monetary targets set forthe first quarter in consultation with the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourthtranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.    The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July orAugust to review performance in the January-June period.    He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billiondlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find theirnet repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.    "It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA(official development assistance) accounts the commercialbanking system will be requested to hold the line," he said.    It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMFdebt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.    The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.    Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos inApril 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started inOctober last year, had almost been completed.    He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding leveltouched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well."Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool," he said.    Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, "Ithink the Philippine debt stock looms large because our ownreceipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leapforward as might have been suitable."    The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.    NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the firstquarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.    Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth ofbetween six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that whilegrowth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.    Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by someeconomists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to thedollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports morecompetitive.    "By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the pesohas already substantially devalued against all of the country'strading partners," he said.    On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he wasopposed to a clause which would allow the unrestrictedrepatriation abroad of investments made during the first twoyears after the imposition of the Code.    The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, hasbeen delayed by objections from some business groups.    "I think any central bank, certainly this one after theevents of the past two or two and a half years, has to beprudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the windsand I'm not about to do that," Fernandez said.    "It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement ofcapital and earnings can be free," he said.    "We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainlywe continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our externalavailabilities simply by servicing our debts." REUTER
GERMAN GNP FIGURES PUBLICATION DELAYED Figures for first quarter 1987 WestGerman GNP will be published on June 11 after they wereprovisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the FederalStatistics Office said.    The official said there had been a delay in gatheringinformation for the data, which are expected to show that theWest German economy contracted in the period.    A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said therewas no political motivation behind publishing the figures onJune 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.    "There is no political motivation. It is a purely technicalmatter," he added.    The West German government is expected to come underpressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partnersto stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing internationaltrade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.    However, government officials have ruled out any furthertax reduction packages to supplement a major program ofstimulatory fiscal measures already underway.    Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West Germancentral bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, thewidest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in realterms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the firstquarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.     The government has confirmed that growth was negative inthe first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected tobe about two pct.    Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance tocut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,at three pct, is just above historical lows.    West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venicesummit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,is already outstripping export performance, which has sufferedfrom an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just overtwo years.    The government has pointed out that depressed exports arethe main reason for the current weakness in the economy, butsays that later in the year stronger domestic demand willcompensate for this setback.    It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just undertwo pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986. REUTER
PAKISTAN SAYS GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES Pakistan says its economy has continuedits recent outstanding performance during the financial year1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments,investments and energy were causing concern.    GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, accordingto a government economic survey.     The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentumand there was an impressive performance in a five pointgovernment program for rural uplift, education and povertyalleviation, said the survey.    Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a newsconference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstormsdamaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pctcompared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might nowslide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.    The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be ninepct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.    Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, homeremittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrsfrom the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.    More exports and an improvement in the balance of paymentssituation will be required to overcome this declining trend inhome remittances, he said.    The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because ofthe boost in exports.    He said national investment continued to be small becauseof a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said moresavings were required to maintain or possibly step up thepresent growth rate and to finance the country's seventhfive-year development plan to be launched in July 1988. REUTER
GERMAN EXPERTS SAY NO FURTHER ECONOMIC STIMULUS The West German government's independentcouncil of economic experts believes a further stimulation ofthe economy is inappropriate, government spokesman FriedhelmOst said.    A statement released by Ost after a meeting of ChancellorHelmut Kohl and senior government officials with the councilsaid the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to twopct was achievable.    It added the council believed "an intensification of thealready expansionary stimulation of monetary and financialpolicy is not called for."    Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure onWest Germany to adapt to external economic factors would notincrease.    The government regularly uses the term "changed externaleconomic factors" when referring to the fall of the dollar,which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officialshave said they expect exports to pick up during the year, butcould still fall below the 1986 level.    Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germanyagreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris inFebruary aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.    The stance taken by the experts backs up the officialposition of the West German government ahead of next week'sseven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to bepressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.    West German government officials have stressed Bonn is notin a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts duenext year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.    The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in officialinterest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.    The experts' prediction for economic growth this year ofbetween 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from aforecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.    Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The governmentitself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986. REUTER

JAPAN GNP RISES 1.2 PCT IN JANUARY/MARCH Japan's gross national product (gnp) rosea real 1.2 pct in the January/March quarter after a downwardlyrevised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three months, theEconomic Planning Agency said.    The October/December rise was originally put at 0.8 pct.    For the fiscal year ended last March 31, gnp rose 2.6 pct,after a 4.3 pct increase in 1985/86. Last year's performancewas the worst since 1974/75, when gnp contracted by 0.4 pct,and was below the government's revised three pct forecast.    Economists said the strong yen was largely to blame for theslowdown in economic growth in 1986/87.    Domestic demand increased 0.7 pct in the January/Marchquarter and 4.3 pct in the fiscal year, compared with growth of0.6 pct in October/December and 3.7 pct in 1985/86.    The annualized growth rate in the January/March quarteraccelerated to 4.9 pct, from 2.9 pct in October/December.    In nominal terms, gnp rose 0.7 pct in January/March, aftera 0.5 pct October/December rise, reflecting lower prices.    Domestic demand contributed 0.7 percentage point to realgnp growth in January/March, while foreign trade added 0.5point. In October/December domestic demand contributed 0.6point, while foreign trade added 0.2 point.    Of the 0.5 point contribution of foreign trade to gnp lastquarter, rising exports accounted for 0.3 point and fallingimports contributed 0.2.    Total export volume rose 2.0 pct quarter-on-quarter inJanuary/March, while imports fell 1.2 pct.    Of the 0.7 point contribution of domestic demand toJanuary/March gnp growth, the private sector accounted for 1.1point while the public sector knocked off 0.4.    The private sector contribution included 0.4 point forcorporate capital outlays and 1.0 for consumer spending, whiledestocking subtracted 0.3 point.

JAPAN OFFICIALS SAY WORST MAY BE OVER FOR ECONOMY Government officials said the worst may beover for the Japanese economy, after today's news of strongerthan expected growth in the January/March period.    But private economists were not so sure and said theeconomy was unlikely to achieve the government's 3.5 pct growthforecast in the current fiscal year ending next March.    As already reported, GNP rose 1.2 pct in the January/Marchquarter, after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous threemonths. For the fiscal year that ended last March 31, GNPgrowth slowed to 2.6 pct from 4.3 pct in 1985/86.    The government economists acknowledged that the improvedexport performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely tobe repeated. The volume of exports during the period was up twopct from the previous three months.    The yen's rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150probably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/Junequarter, they said.    However, given the yen's recent stability, stepped-updomestic demand should work as a driving force to push theeconomy onto a path of sustainable growth, they said.    Many private economists, though, doubt that the economywill achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth forecast for the1987/88 year.    Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government'sforecast, which was revised downwards to three pct lastDecember from an original four pct.    Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough, except forhousing, said Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at MitsubishiResearch Institute.    Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth innominal income stays low, he added.     The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarterwas simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in thepreceding three months, Takahashi said.    Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong butthis was primarily because utility companies brought forwardtheir 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarterof 1986/87 in line with the government's economic stimulationpackage announced last fall, he said.    Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said hewas unable to say the economy has bottomed out, but added heexpects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months.    Destocking is coming to an end and companies are startingto rebuild inventories, Furuta said.    Housing is expected to remain buoyant, backed up by lowerinterest rates as well as government policies to stimulate thesector, he said. The government's recently unveiled 6,000billion yen economic package will also help the economy.    But he said that the economy was unlikely to achieve thegovernment's 3.5 pct forecast for 1987/88, although growthmight come close to three pct. REUTER
S.KOREA SEES GNP GROWTH MORE THAN 10 PCT THIS YEAR South Korea's gross national product (GNP)will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will risefurther as long as the current account surplus continues towiden, Deputy Prime Minister Chun In-Yong told reporters.    Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said hisGNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy willremain stable.    The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct.    GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures.    GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.    In the first four months of this year, the current accountswung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.    "What the Minister said does not imply any major economicpolicy change," a Ministry spokesman told Reuters. "But he triedto urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic(future) ... A high won era."    South Korean manufacturers, who have insisted the wonshould not rise more than seven pct this year, have said theyplan to ask the government to slow down its appreciationagainst the dollar.    The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year comparedwith a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.    The won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in threedays earlier this month while an International Monetary Fundteam held talks here to discuss revaluation. REUTER
SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH Strong growth in domestic demand was a keyfeature of the economies of southern European countries in1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.    In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's totaldomestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year tofive pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growthrestrained private consumption.    Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 anddomestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expectedto be halved to five pct next year.    In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,had been the driving force behind rapid growth in GrossDomestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumptionwere expected to ease during 1988 but would still remainstrong.    The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharplynext year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the EuropeanCommunity and declining competitiveness.    In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwardsfollowing an increase early this year linked with theintroduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices dueto cold weather. REUTER
OECD SAYS HIGH WAGE DEALS HARMING NORDIC STATES High wage settlements in Nordic countriesthreaten to cut exports and reduce the internationalcompetitiveness of their industries, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.    In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded inearly 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deteriorationin competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seenat risk from accelerating wages.    The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come underpressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well asNorway, Sweden and Finland.    Overall economic growth will vary in the differentcountries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual reportsaid.    After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domesticdemand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and onepct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see aslump in domestic demand. The report said growth in GrossDomestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly inSweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmarkand Norway.    Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economicstrategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustainedand balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said. REUTER
 OECD SEES 1.5 PCT WEST GERMAN REAL GNP GROWTH Australia's economy should manage modestgrowth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown butunemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.    The organisation's latest half-yearly report says GrossDomestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pctin 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will behelped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demandfollowing tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.    The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumerprices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.    The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightlyand could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.    While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growthforecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.    The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economicgrowth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which isstruggling to recover from a major economic crisis.    The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year,should again show growth over the next two years, rising by0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988. Reuter
FALL IN CANADIAN BUDGET DEFICIT TO SLOW Finance Minister Michael Wilson said taxreform will not affect his determination to reign inexpenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the declinein the budget deficit in the late 1980s.    "Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,"Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.    Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrsin the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as heforecast in the February budget.    And in the year ended this past March, the deficit wasexpected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.    Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal yearhigher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm incomesupport programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipatedrevenues.    But finance department documents show the pace of deficitreduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and thetransition to the reformed taxation system.    The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs infiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1billion dlrs in 1991.    Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadianeconomy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pctthis year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by anactual 3.1 pct.    Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at aroundthe current four pct level over the next two years. Reuter
U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS The economy faces lackluster growthand the risk of recession this year if the recent improvementin U.S. exports should falter, economists say.    Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weaknessin the key housing and auto sectors and could be furtherhampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.    "These factors raise the question: Is there enough strengthto keep the economy from tipping into a recession?" said LyleGramley, chief economist of the Mortgage BankersAssociation and a former Federal Reserve Board official.    The Commerce Department said this week that the economygrew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, buta U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.    Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spendingrose a weak 0.1 per cent.    "Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, "Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,told Reuters.    Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slowbecause inflation is rising faster than real wages.    To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boostpersonal income and consumption, he says.    "I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports tokeep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,"Gramley said.    Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reportersthat the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was theresult of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not lastand said the recovery was showing anemia.    Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, "The paceof the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored intomonetary policy" - possibly a signal that the Fed will beaccommodative.    Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pctforecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that ifthe dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and addto the risk of a recession.    Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in Maycame despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where aninventory overhang still exists.    He says the boost in production came from smallerindustries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which haveimproved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.    "They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge ineconomic activity, but I think they will keep us out of arecession," Mauro said.    In a speech to financial planners this week, BerylSprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted thetrade deficit will continue to improve.    "Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 andinto 1988 are still quite favorable," he said.    But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence ininflation.    Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman BrothersInc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 aftera 1.1 pct increase in 1986.    The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oiland energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.    "The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie getsout of the bottle, it continues to persist," he said, adding hewould like the Fed to tighten credit.    A major factor affecting inflation is the value of thedollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, saysa prominent international banker.    Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the NationalPress Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen andthe mark will continue for years because the United States isthe world's largest debtor nation.    The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to afurther slackening of activity and called naive the belief thatthe five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever."It is very difficult to be optimistic," Gut said.
