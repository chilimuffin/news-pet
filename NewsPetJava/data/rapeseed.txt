WEST GERMAN BARLEY, RAPE AFFECTED BY WINTER KILL Winter kill has probably affected WestGerman winter barley and rapeseed to an above average degreethis season, West German grain trader Alfred C. Toepfer said inits latest report.    It is too soon to assess the extent of the damage, but itis likely that northern West German crops are particularly atrisk because of insufficient snow cover, it said.    The soil needs to warm up rapidly and moisture content mustimprove to avoid further delays to spring field work, it added. REUTER

Crushers reduced their Canadian purchases for late June andJuly to 111,000 from 120,000 tonnes due to seasonal maintenancework at oil mills.    But estimated crushers' buying for July/August was slightlyabove monthly average and is likely to keep to this level for awhile due to a better crushing margin compared with that ofsoybeans, they said.

JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pctto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pctfrom 2.1 pct. REUTER

OILMEAL DEMAND STILL STRONG IN U.S., SOVIET UNION Oilmeal demand remained strong in theUnited States in July and August and six pct up on levels seenin the same months last year, with most of the rise coming insoymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose toa record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pcton the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal atseven pct, it said.    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago monthsfollowing a huge increase in soymeal imports.    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediatelybut went into stocks. With imports again large in September, itestimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes byOctober 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a yearearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due tobumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposalswere reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mlnat that time last year.
