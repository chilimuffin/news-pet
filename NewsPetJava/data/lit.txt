BALLADUR URGES ADHERENCE TO G-7 CURRENCY ACCORDS French Finance Minister Edouard Balladursaid the Group of Seven major industrial nations, G-7, canachieve stable currency values by adhering to accords reachedthis year in Paris and Washington.    Balladur, asked at a news conference if coordinated marketintervention by central banks was sufficient to halt thedollar's recent slide, said "each country has to fulfillcommitments" outlined in the G-7 accords.    Earlier this month in Washington, finance ministers of theU.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canadareaffirmed an earlier Paris accord to arrest the dollar's fall.    Balladur said the current nervousness in foreign exchangemarkets can be partly attributed to "some operators in themarket only watching short term economic indicators. You haveto keep a cool head," he said, declining to elaborate further.    In an earlier speech before the Milan Chamber of Commerce,the minister said European countries have to seek "a betterconsensus of economic and monetary policies."    On the European Monetary System, he said, "The persistentvulnerability of the foreign currency mechanism, particularlyto the movements of the dollar, can be explained by the absenceof a common policy for currencies of other countries."    Balladur said, "I am profoundly convinced that the Europeancountries have to define together this position with respect tothe dollar and the yen."    He said Italy eventually would have to abandon its highermargin of fluctuation within the European Montetary System. "Ihope that the spectacular improvement of the economic situationand of the balance of payments will permit (Italy) to do itsoon."    The lira is currently allowed a fluctuation margin eitherside of its agreed midpoints with other EMS currencies of sixpct, against 2.25 pct permitted for the other members.  REUTER
