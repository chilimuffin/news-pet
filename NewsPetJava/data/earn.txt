OHIO MATTRESS <OMT> MAY HAVE LOWER 1ST QTR NET Ohio Mattress Co said its firstquarter, ending February 28, profits may be below the 2.4 mlndlrs, or 15 cts a share, earned in the first quarter of fiscal1986.    The company said any decline would be due to expensesrelated to the acquisitions in the middle of the currentquarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct ofthe outstanding capital stock of Sealy.    Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter saleswill be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.    Noting that it typically reports first quarter results inlate march, said the report is likely to be issued in earlyApril this year.    It said the delay is due to administrative considerations,including conducting appraisals, in connection with theacquisitions. Reuter

DEAN FOODS <DF> SEES STRONG 4TH QTR EARNINGS Dean Foods Co expects earnings for thefourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the sameyear-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.    In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processorreported earnings of 40 cts a share.    Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.    He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarterearnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.    Douglas said it was too early to project whether theanticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for usto exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs ashare.    In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pctimprovement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reformact alone."    President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company willderive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetableacquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.    Dean also said the company will benefit from itsacquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, WestChicago.    He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I. FoodsLtd, a United Kingdom blender, and has licensing arrangementsin Australia, Canada, Brazil and Japan.    "It provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp <MCD> we've beenafter for years," Douglas told analysts. Reuter

Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage operations.

Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to5,506 billion yen from a projected 5,328 billion this year, NTTsaid in a business operations plan submitted to the Post andTelecommunications Ministry.    NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1,770billion yen in 1987/88, including 109 billion for research anddevelopment, as against a total of 1,600 billion this year.    An NTT spokesman said increased competition from newentrants to the telecommunications field and the effect of asales tax scheduled to be introduced next January, were themajor factors behind the projected decrease in profits.    The Japanese telecommunications industry was deregulated in1985. REUTER
ESTIMATED DROP IN JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS TRIMMED The combined profits of Japan's majorcorporations, excluding financial institutions, are forecast tofall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31, compared tothe 19.9 pct decline projected in late November, Wako ResearchInstitute of Economics said.    The private research body also said in a statement that 437of the 1,084 firms listed on the first section of the TokyoStock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the yearagainst an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November.    Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 onsales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said.    Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industriesto cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brightentheir business outlook, the institute said.    It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reducecorporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improvedperformance outlook.    Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector willbe supported by firm demand in the real estate and constructionbusinesses, it said.    The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimatesof 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88. REUTER

HUTCHISON SEES HIGHER PAYOUT, SATISFACTORY PROFITS Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <HWHH.HK>expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higherdividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said.    He did not make any specific projections for the company'searnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend ofnot less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposedfour-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.    It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year,equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and sharesplit.    Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading toproperty and container terminals, earlier reported after-taxprofits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.    The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mlndlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the SouthChina Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper,compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said itexpects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of theremaining shares.    Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong whileits economy is performing better than forecast with its largelyexport-led growth.    Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last yearagainst an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.    But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S.May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affectthe British colony.    He said all of the company's major operations showedimproved results in 1986.    Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pctinterest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> to<Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off fromHongkong Electric.    Under a reorganisation announced separately, HongkongElectric will spin off all its non-electricity relatedactivities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the localstock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive oneshare in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.    Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric sharesfrom Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.    The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares willgive Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.    Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieveHongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company formaking risky investments. But he denied there was pressure fromthe government for the spin-off.    He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assetsand will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.Its major assets are the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel, propertydevelopment, and interests in Husky Oil Ltd <HYO.TO> of Canadaand Pearson Plc <PSON.L> of Britain.

CHEUNG KONG CHAIRMAN SEES STRONG RESULTS IN 1987 Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd <CKGH.HK>is expecting strong results this year after reporting betterthan expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said.    He did not give a specific earnings projection but he toldreporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and afour-for-one stock split.

ICI <ICI> SEEKS GAINS IN SPECIALTY BUSINESSES Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, thelargest chemical company in the United Kingdom, will expand itsspecialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and betterits 1986 results, said chairman-elect Denys Henderson.    "We expect to shift our company toward higher value-addedbusinesses and continue to broaden our base," Henderson toldreporters at an informal meeting here.    ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S.drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its StuartPharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its currentpharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990.    Henderson said, "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost inthe way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not."    ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drugmaker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales wereabout 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs,which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits.    He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical divisionwould account for about 30 pct of total company profits.    "The drug division far and away brings in the highest rateof return," said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, whowas also at the meeting.    Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basicallyact as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugsto doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one.    Henderson said the major new products in the company'spipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrsannually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications,Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin,a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure.    Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvalto market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensingagreements with Merck and Co Inc <MRK>, is not expected untilabout 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwinin the U.S. later this year.    Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much.    Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by GliddenPaints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from aunit of Hanson Industries Inc.    Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrsavailable for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that moreacquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out anacquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as "too expensive."    Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effectiveApril one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones whowill retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing theearnings momentum ICI has established over the past few yearsafter restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELPED RETURN TO PROFITS Comalco Ltd <CMAC.S> said its returnto profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminiumprices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.    It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for theyear ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 wasalso aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt andgreater sales of bauxite and aluminium.    Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents pershare final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage ofproposed dividend imputation laws.    This would make five cents for the year against a first andfinal of one cent in 1985.    Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to sufferfrom low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australiandollar had helped earnings.    Withdrawal from the <Showa Aluminium Industries KK> jointventure had been recapitalised in expansion by the <New ZealandAluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's <SumitomoAluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitting repayments and increasesin liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said.    As previously reported Comalco's <Commonwealth AluminiumCorp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter atGoldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregonto <Columbia Aluminium Corp>.    Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinaryprovision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that ifthe sales agreement were completed it would reduce theprovision made in the 1986 accounts.    The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchangelosses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision. REUTER
CRA EXPECTS TO PAY FINAL DIVIDEND OF 10 CENTS CRA Ltd <CRAA.S> said it expected topay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a shareafter July 1, making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985.    The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 netearnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, againstanalysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln.    CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend untillater this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputationto its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-freeto shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which thefull 49 pct company tax rate has been pid.    The company operates on a substituted tax year, not thefiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax atthe 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.    Consequently, it has funds available for distribution withdividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputationlegislation before determining the final payout, it said.    Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a pooryear for the minerals industry, with the notable exception ofgold producers.    Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollarsdeclined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.    Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatilityand uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading tosubstantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.    World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories havesteadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,but overcapacity continues, CRA said.    Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA saidBougainville Copper Ltd <BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrswhile its share of Comalco Ltd's <CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.    Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrsagainst 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.    Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operationsincurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in1985, CRA said.    Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrsagainst 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mlnfrom 2.8 mln.    CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond projectamounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.    CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinaryloss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchangelosses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.    Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided forclosures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase infuture tax provisions, CRA said.    Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrsbefore capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. Thestrong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rightsissue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debtto be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.    CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost. REUTER

Unilever Plc and Nv combined 1986 pre-tax profit 1.14 billion stg vs  West German banks would like Brazil to workmore closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with aview to seeking a solution to the country's debt problems,senior West German banking sources said.    The sources, speaking ahead of a meeting later todaybetween Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his Westgerman counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg, also believed Brazilshould come up with a convincing economic recovery program.    Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson, who met Funaro yesterday.    Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involvegovernments in negotiations with commercial banks onrescheduling part of Brazil's foreign debt, which totals some109 billion dlrs. But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solveits problems with the banks rather than governments.    Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave earlytomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg thisevening.    Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with theIMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to anausterity program with the Fund.    However, the West German banking sources said institutionshere felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented acredible recovery program and that there be a "rapprochement"with the IMF.    "Consultations are the least that can be expected," said onebanker.    Funaro's trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago tosuspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercialdebt. It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited byforeign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs.    One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debtnegotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funarofor a change in the structure of the advisory committee ofbanks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982.    Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks, holding 35 pct ofBrazilian debt, were over-represented on the 14-bank advisorycommittee with 50 pct of the committee seats. He said Brazilmight adopt a different approach to its creditor banks,involving separate discussions with the regions.    Such a move would be in Brazil's interest, since Europeanbanks have been more supportive than U.S. Banks of alternativedebt solutions, such as interest capitalisation.    The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regionalapproach, saying: "There must be one committee and one solution."But he added: "There must be an understanding that specialrequests from special regions be taken into account."    German banks had objected to the fact that the idea ofinterest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. Itwas imperative that alternative options be considered. "The menumust become richer," the banker said.    Banking sources said commercial banks would not be involvedin today's talks with Funaro. A spokesman for the Bundesbank inFrankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented.    West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to theBrazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions inthe United States, because of their lower exposure.    According to Bundesbank data from September last year, WestGerman bank exposure to Latin America of slightly under 16billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreigncredit. REUTER
DAIMLER OUTPUT COULD BE AFFECTED BY DISPUTE Daimler-Benz AG [DAIG.F] said its carproduction could fall by 150 cars a day in  the foreseeablefuture  if works councils continue to refuse to approve thefirm's requests for employees to work overtime when necessary.    A company spokesman said the works council at Daimler'sUnterturkheim plant, which makes axles and other components forDaimler cars, has withheld approval for overtime since thebeginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in thestate of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in thestate to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employmore workers.    The Daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at theUnterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at otherplants but added he was unable to say when this might occur.    A spokesman for Dr.-Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG [PSHG.F], whichis also located in Baden-Wuerttemberg, said he did not thinkPorsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban onovertime by its own works councils.    A strike by IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg in 1984 closeddown the German car industry for about seven weeks as the unionsought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. It latersettled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours.    The spokesman said Daimler's total output of cars wascurrently around 2,500 a day. REUTER

Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy tothe more conventional practice of depreciating assetsindividually rather than depreciating fixed assets at averagerates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in theaccumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase thenet book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as atJanuary 1, 1987.

The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports,said "He continues to be interested were the group to offer thebrewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put togethera consortium, nor has he been buying shares."    He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance assaying he would be interested if it came on the market and thathe had the support of two international banks if he decidedsuch a purchase might be worthwhile.    In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewingprofits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts,the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts.    "A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack forthe brewing division in the current Guinness situation," hesaid.    "This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge,but not impossible," he added.    The deal would mean buying the Dublin, London, Nigerian andMalaysian breweries because "It could only be sold as anintegral unit if it was going to be sold at all," O'Reilly said. Reuter
EQUATORIAL COMMUNICATIONS <EQUA> TO HAVE LOSSES Equatorial CommunicationsCo said it expects to report losses of about 57 mln dlrs forthe fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 onrevenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrsfor the year.    Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of itsbusiness, including adjustments to reflect the market value oftransponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reservesfor inventory, receivables and excess facilities.    Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results willalso include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, inaddition to the 45 mln dlr charge.    Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operatingin technical default under its lease of transponders on theGalaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintainagreed-upon financial ratios.  It said it is in talks with thelessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.    Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two otheroblitations in connection with the purchase or lease oftransponders as a result of cross-default provisions.    Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understandingfor Contel Corp <CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorialmaster earth stations, micro earth stations and associatedequipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-monthperiod for repayment starting in December 1988.    The company said Conteol, under the agreement, would assumea portion of Equatorial's rights and obligations under theGalaxy III transponder lease with <Burnham Leasing> on theoccurrence of certain events.    Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buyabout 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.    Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subjectto Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion ofits obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders andlessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease.It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15.

He told reporters that volumes in North America increasedsome 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pctafter being flat for some years.    Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentratingactivities on core businesses, had now been completed, henoted.    But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategicacquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said.    The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-taxprofits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level droppedthree pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.    Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc<CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring anyearnings dilution.    However, it would not add much to profits, with much of thecompany's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.    Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about40 pct by end-1987.    The same divergence was made in full year dividend, withUnilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and UnileverPlc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line withthe change in attributable profit.    Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts ofChesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he saidthat there was no target date for completing the process.    He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped torealise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough hadpaid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, whichoperates outside Unilever's core activities.    In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,considerable expansion in the household products business andin margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.    However, he noted that the U.S. Household products businesshad turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performancebetter than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costsof its Surf detergents.

PRECAMBRIAN SHIELD TAKES 51 MLN DLR WRITEDOWN <Precambrian Shield ResourcesLtd>, earlier reporting a large loss against year-ago profit,said the 1986 loss was mainly due to a 51,187,000 dlr writedownon its U.S. operations, uneconomic coal and other mineralproperties.    Precambrian, which is 89 pct owned by <Mark Resources Inc>,said it took the writedown in accordance with new CanadianInsititute of Chartered Accountants guidelines for full costmethod accounting by oil and gas companies.    Precambrian earlier reported a 1986 loss of 53.4 mln dlrs,compared to profit of 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior year. Reuter

PHARMACIA FORECASTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS Pharmacia AB <PHAB ST> forecastearnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remainedat their present parities.    Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billioncrowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.    A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pctnegative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamedon currency movements.    Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-offwritedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.    The company said mainly this represented the premium thegroup had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms ithad taken over.    The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partlyby drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion andpartly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.    Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by ithaving used more funds than generated by group operations,mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for sharesin LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-IntraocularInc.

CONTINENTAL <GIC> SEES 1987 NET UP FROM TAX LAW Continental Corp said the fresh startprovision of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may add 1.30 to 1.60 to1987 earnings per share.    The insurance holding company had net earnings of 449.6 mlndlrs, or, or 7.42 per share, in 1986.    John Loynes, Continental chief financial officer, said thefresh start provision allowed the company to discount openingtax reserves to January 1, 1987, which released deferred taxesinto earnings.    Loynes said the provision's potential benefit would declinegradually over the next four years, during which timeContinental will pay 250 mln to 350 mln dlrs more in taxes.    Loynes added, however, the higher taxes are not expecetd tohave a significant impact on earnings. Reuter
ROYAL BANK OF CANADA 1ST QTR SHR 88 CTS VS 1 Belgian Foreign Trade Minister HermanDe Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within theEuropean Community, EC, on its proposed tax on vegetable fatsand oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the UnitedStates.    De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administrationofficials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conferencethere is a battle within the community on the tax on fats andoils used in the 12 EC countries.    But he added, "I do not think it will be a big issue becausethere will be a big debate inside Europe," adding "so there willbe a compromise."    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterdaythat if the community went ahead with the tax, the UnitedStates would respond "vigorously" to protect its trade rights andaccess to community markets.    De Croo also said he thought the community would postponeits April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules tocover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress wasmade toward resolving differences with the United States.    U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards andthe EC should require equivalent but not identical standards.    He also told reporters he hoped the community could dealwith another controversial health proposal that would forbidthe feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by theUnited States.    De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might beresolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988.    He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to changeslaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned afew months later by the hormone rule. Reuter

Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continueddebt-servicing problems ... in the North American energyindustry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and alsocontinued to add to its general provisions for loans totroubled borrower countries.    The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter endedJanuary 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in theyear-ago quarter.

ROYAL BANK SEES IMPROVED RESULTS <Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects toreport improved results in future earnings periods.    "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, anda solid capital position...combined with the restraint ofnon-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in theperiods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.    The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarterended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a yearago.    Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue tosubstantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank'sinternational operations remains weak, reflectingresource-related difficulties of private and public sectorborrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital marketactivities.    The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago whileearnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrsfrom 42 mln dlrs last year.    Royal Bank said first quarter international net interestincome declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenuesfrom international investment banking as well as a significantloss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.    Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs lastyear. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retaildeposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue butlower securities commissions from international investment bankoperations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.

WALL STREET STOCKS/ANACOMP INC <AAC> Anacomp Inc, one of the most activelytraded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expectedearnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of amicrographics company.    Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares aftertrading as high as seven earlier.    Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, saidAnacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could bedoubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he hadforecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, amicrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp <GD>.    "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybeas much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said."Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it willintegrate the company in the second half."    Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problemsintegrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.    A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to completeits deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not sayhow much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted thatDatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to GeneralDynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.    Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimatesthat Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs forDatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down tobetween 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added.    Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share inits first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one cta share.    In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 ctsa share.    Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said. Reuter

GE <GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER One of General Electric Co's biggestbusinesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasingprofits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,Wall Street analysts said.    Previously, it was expected the business would peak anddecline at some point in the next five years. The improvedoutlook results from AMR Corp's <AMR> decision to order 40 newplanes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.    "Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order," saidNicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangementsfor its order of 15 Boeing Co <BA> and 25 <Airbus Industrie>twinjet long distance aircraft.    But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allowit to operate the aircraft without adding to its debtstructure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of theplanes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protectsAMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severedownturn in the economy.    From GE's point of view the package looks like a good dealfor several reasons, Heymann said.    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time ofdelivery, Heymann noted.    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planesGE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,would have little trouble rounding up another airline thatwanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the dealappears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.    GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares bymidafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Uphamand Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no oneorder will have much of an effect on the stock."    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said theorder "will help to maintain a good level of production andprofitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE.    Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet enginebusiness rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrsby 1991.    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs lastyear, with well over half of the business in the militarysector, according to analysts' estimates.    The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincideswith an upbeat performance in other segments.    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the firstquarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corpthat it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business andreshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with otherelements of its 14 business areas.    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the currentquarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by theNBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.    Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in partcrediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition." Reuter

ROCKWELL <ROK> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987 Rockwell International Corpcontinues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results,despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of itsbusiness segments, President Donald Beall told Reuters.    Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter endedDecember 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, comparedto 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago.    Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, andanalysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell'sAllen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in theindustrial automation market.    "It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. Itis moving forward with market development and is enhancingmarket share," Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit.    Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technologymanagement conference, said first quarter sales for theAllen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. Hesaid the company does not break out operating earnings by uniton a quarterly basis.    Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in theresearch and development phase of government contracts shouldnot have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance.    He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharingcould limit technological innovation.    "I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse ofcontracting approaches too early in the development stages ofimportant military contracts," Beall said, adding, "long-term,we have a very serious problem."    In addition, Beall told the conference the greatestcompetitive threat to defense contractors is in defenseelectronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantageof competitively priced products made outside the U.S. Reuter

B.C. RESOURCES HAS AGREEMENT ON CREDIT FACILITY <British ColumbiaResources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full yearoperating losses, said it reached agreement in principle withfive lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over afour year term.    The company said the credit facility is extendable undercertain circumstances, with annual principal payments of fivemln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvalsand completion of formal documentation.    It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary itemsrose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.    B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remainsuspended.    However, payment will be made on account of the quarterlydividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company'strustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.    Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount ofthe March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferredshareholders, with payment expected in early April toshareholders of record March 31, the company said.    If future dividends are not declared after the Aprilexchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment willdepend on the amount of dividends received from WestcoastTransmission Co <WTC>, B.C. Resources said.    The company said its increased fourth quarter and full yearoperating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and afour month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in BritishColumbia.    B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinaryloss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil andgas interests by 67 pct owned <Westar Mining Ltd>.    B.C.

Gains on thesales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills andTerrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, thecompany said.    The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C.Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea andexposure to the fluctuating pulp market.    It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrsfrom 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changesand staff cuts have significantly reduced costs. Reuter

TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS <GM> General Motors Corp staged an explosiverally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announcedyesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded bystiff competition and erosion of market share.    GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analystsagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.    "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of KidderPeabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancingshareholder value."    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for thebuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker torecapture lost market share.    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buyback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. Theannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on thestock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and atleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on agood performance expected from new car models.    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said therepurchase program is not a positive.    "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook andputs more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM willhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stockshould settle back down to around 76, he added.    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from fourdlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domesticcar and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars arenot selling as well as their competitors," he said.    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from theyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co <F> andChrysler Corp <C> both posted increases. But GM said Februarysales showed improvement over January, adding that it expectsimprovement in coming months.    Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fallto around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,analysts said. The numbers include imports.    Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and productimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by thefourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.    "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling upits sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a majorearnings surprise in the winds," he said.    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, inpart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is moreconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuationwith respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said.    Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currentlyfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield thanits competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cashdividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Incsaid U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, ifsuccessful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of itsmarket share.    "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that willonly curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middleof the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, hesaid results will not improve until 1988.    "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is atransition year for GM," he said.    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will notaffect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what theyearn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that'simportant." Reuter

TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS French oil group Total Cie Francaise desPetroles <TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion francconsolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986,after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, thecompany said in a communique after a board meeting here.    In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli toldjournalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollarhad caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated netprofit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into aconsolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs.    Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total'srefining and distribution subsidiary Cie deRaffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France <RAFF.PA>, toldjournalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for thesubsidiary before stock depreciation.    CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation andcurrency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16billion loss in 1985.    But its net loss last year, taking account of thatdepreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billionfrancs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985.    In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independentdistributors following a relaxation of regulations," Guilbaudsaid.    The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a jobreduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mlnfrancs, he said.    Concerning business in 1987, he said that "January was agood month, but the situation deteriorated in February." Reuter

ALLIS-CHALMERS <AH> PROPOSES RESTRUCTURING Allis-Chalmers Corp said it askedlenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan thatwould cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock.    The company said it would sell all of its businesses otherthan the American Air Filter business, make a public financingof more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currentlyoutstanding debt with the proceeds.    Under the plan, which was presented to institutionallenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit GuarantyCorp, "substantial amounts" of institutional debt would beconverted to common stock of the restructured company.    Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferredstock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt andpreferred stock for common equity will cause a "resultingdilution of the existing common stock," Allis-Chalmers said ina statement.    Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existingpreferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common.    Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan isbankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors,common and preferred holders,and present and former employees.    Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing "appears torepresent the company's only alternative if agreement upon theterms of the plan cannot be reached."    The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he wasnot aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings thatwould result from the restructuring.    "It is too early to talk about a charge" because the planmust still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said.    Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' privatelenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligationsincurred in the ordinary course of business will be met.    Payment of health benefits for active and retired employeeswould be made "at substantially reduced levels."    Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipmentcompanies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutzof West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company withbusinesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handlingand solid materials processing.    Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business toAC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio.    Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell itssolid materials processing and fluids handling businesses.Solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crushstones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs ofAllis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs.    The company will also sell its fluids handling operations,which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues.    Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs,or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs,or 12.27 dlrs a share.

HK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp<HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth,share analysts polled by Reuters said.    Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last yearranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will beannounced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.    They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for aone-for-five bonus issue.    Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonusissue this year, probably one for three or one for five.    The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd <HSGH.HK>is to report its 1986 results on Friday.    Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of morethan one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to12 pct.    They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrsfor a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.    Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed innerreserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of theHong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew bynearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.    "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at MansionHouse Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.    Government figures show that total loans and advances roseby 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.    Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay ofthe local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of fivepct in 1985.    Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest receivedon loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank andHang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the bankingsystem, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.    The strength of the real-estate market was another majorincome source for the bank group. Loans to finance propertydevelopment and instalment mortgages rose sharply.    "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgagebusiness despite tough competition from the Bank of China groupand other foreign banks," one analyst said.    The high level of activity on the capital and equitiesmarkets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in HongkongBank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd <WAIA.HK> and <James Capel andCo>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting asfinancial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said.    Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlrflotation of <Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which HongkongBank owned 30 pct at the time.    The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in returnfor 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stakein <South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of twoEnglish-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.    The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and willnot show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.    Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reducedneed to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was muchlower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong LeongSecurities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions."    Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said thebank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against itsshipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County SecuritiesAsia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. Sheforecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.    The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, appears to haveimproved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrsfrom 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985. REUTER

JAGUAR SEES STRONG GROWTH IN NEW MODEL SALES Jaguar Plc <JAGR.L> is about to sell itsnew XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects astrong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman SirJohn Egan told a news conference.    Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightlybelow 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an averageprofit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction ofthe new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.    Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans tosell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.    U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,finance director John Edwards said.    A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwardssaid the relatively high car prices in dollars of West Germancompetitors offered an "umbrella" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which wouldrestrict the car's price.    Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part ofits receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.    In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pctof net sales and training two pct.    Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for theother half. The firm is in early stages of considering thebuilding of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg,but Egan said this would take at least another three years    On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were lastquoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, afterreporting 1986 results which were in line with marketexpectations, dealers said.

INTERNATIONAL THOMSON ORGANISATION LTD YEAR SHR 33 Enzon Inc said a newtreatment using its investigational new drug PEG-ADA hasrestored the functioning of the immune system in the first twochildren that were born deficient in the enzyme adenosinedeaminase.    The disorder is known as severe combined immunodeficiencydisease, or "bubble boy disease"    Bubble Boy Disease is a rare but severe disease thathampers the development of the immune system. It has killedmost of its victims before adulthood.    Children with the disease are consigned to live in asterile environment, such as a plastic bubble, to avoidinfection, the company said.    The study of Enzon's drug, conducted at Duke University,showed that two children suffering from the disease weretreated for 11 and seven months, respectively, and were free ofserious infection during that time, the company said. Theresults were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.    The disease is caused by a missing enzyme, called AdenosineDeaminase, or ADA, that is crucial to the development of theimmune system.    Enzon said it has developed a technology to coat the enzymewith a substance called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, serving todisguise the enzyme when it is reintroduced into the body,preventing rejection.    "Marked improvement in laboratory tests of immune functionoccurred in each child, along with an increase in the number ofT-lymphocytes, the immune cells that were missing beforetreatment with PEG-ADA had begun," the study said.    "The children are now more active and have begun to gainweight and height. Before treatment their growth had been verypoor in comparison to normal children of the same age," thestudy, conducted by Doctors Michael Hershfield and RebeccaBuckley, said.    The PEG-ADA injections were given once a week. Victims ofthe disease have traditionally been treated by bone marrowtransplants, but for most, donors are not available ortransplantation is unsuccessful, the company said. Otherdiseases caused by a missing enzyme might also be treated byintroducing a PEG coated enzyme, the article noted. Reuter

CANADIAN IMPERIAL SEES LOWER LOAN LOSSES <Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>,earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter endedJanuary 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than lastyear's 697.0 mln dlrs.    However, the bank said it will maintain the high level ofprovisioning for loan losses established last year because ofmany market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan lossprovisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.    The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basicshare after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.    Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it usedan estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses incalculating first quarter results.    The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.    Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt anagressive posture in adding to its general provisions againstloan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federalgovernment's Inspector General of Banks.    First quarter net partly benefitted from net interestincome, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.    Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net incomewas partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions,non-interest expenses and income taxes.    The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainlyto continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.    Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986,but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.    The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billiondlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs fromfiscal 1986 year-end.    "Despite the recent announcement of the suspension ofinterest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loansto this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987,and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earningsprior to the announcement," Commerce bank said.

About 2.9 mln dlrs of the class action settlement will beprovided by Paradyne's insurance carrier. The settlement iscontingent on court approval after notice to class members, itsaid.     The criminal case settlement dismisses all chargesincluding bribery and false statement, except for conspiracy towhich Paradyne pleaded guilty.    The criminal settlement includes the lifting of thegovernment's suspension, the dismissal of the federal civilfalse claims suit and all charges against the individuals.    Of the 2.9 mln dlrs the insurance carrier will provide forthe civil settlement, 750,000 dlrs will go to settle aderivative lawsuit.    For the year ended December 31, Paradyne reported a netloss of 38.5 mln dlrs. The year-end results include an 8.0 mlndlrs provision for future legal and or settlement costs tocover the civil and criminal settlements announced today.    Paradyne also said it named Jerry Kendall as president andchief executive officer, succeeding Robert Wiggins who resignedas chairman and chief executive officer as part of thesettlement of the indictment.    Kendall formerly served as executive vice president andchief operating officer.    The company also said that due to the sluggish marketplace,it does not expect to be profitable in the first quarter but isoptimistic about the outlook for the year.    For the first quarter of 1986, the company reported netincome of 875,000 dlrs on sales of 66.0 mln dlrs.    Wiggins was among five Paradyine executives who werecharged along with three former officers in a 1985 federalindictment stemming from a 115 mln contract awarded to Paradynein 1981 to build a computer network for the Social SecurityAdministration.    The men were accused of conspiring to bribe governmentofficials and defaud the Social Security Administration.Wiggins and other defendants were also charged with providingfalse testimony and obstructing justice during a Securities andExchange Commission investigation.    Under the settlement announced today, federal prosecutorsagreed to defer all charges against Wiggins and three otherdefendants under a one-year pretrial agreement.    The charges would then be dropped if the defendantssuccessfully complete the probation period. Details of therequirements in the agreement were not immediately available.           Reuter

ABN SAYS PROFIT RISE ENCOURAGING IN VIEW DOLLAR Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. <ABNN.AS>chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increasein net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 wasencouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar.    Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the releaseof ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreignearnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance,notably in the securities business.    He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock.    News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's shareprice on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.    Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely thefuture trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates andABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.    Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1pct to 242 mln guilders, he added.    Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earningsmargins via traditional lending activities, he said.    Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing riskprovisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overlyconcerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factorwhich brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bankstocks recently.    He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financiallytroubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were LatinAmerican countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.    He added that losses incurred through loans to tinproducers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 hadbeen written off. REUTER

ATT <T> PHONE PROPOSAL TO HELP PROFITS American Telephone and Telegraph Co'sproposal to deregulate its long distance phone service isunlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but itshould help the company's profits, analysts said.    "Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for largevolume users, but status quo for residential users," saidPaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman.    But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that hasconstrained the company's profits in the long distancebusiness, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said.    ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distancebusiness, the profits of which have been limited by a regulatedrate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cutlast year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct.    Earlier today the company proposed to the FederalCommunications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amountof time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up toits competitors to oppose it filings.    MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> made a similar filingyesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competitionin the telephone business.    Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs inthe long-distance unit, and increase its profit marginspreviously constrained by the rate of return. But many saidthey did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices inthe industry, simply because of the competition the phoneindustry giant faces.    "You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,"said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. "But you wouldn'tsee a rise." Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT toselectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. "Itwill give ATT a lot more flexibility," he said.    ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number ofcompanies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCChearings.    It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, thelong distance joint venture between GTE Corp <GTE> and UnitedTelecommunications Inc <UT>.    "We think the Congress of the FCC should establish areasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it," a U.S.Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposedto greater competition.    It may also take some time for the proposals to go through,and in the process they may be altered by the variousconstituencies affected by the move.    "There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so muchbureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, itwon't happen that fast," said analyst Victor Krueger of theGartner Group. Reuter

STEWART-WARNER CORP 4TH QTR SHR LOSS 3.86 DLRS VS PROFI An investor group led by New Yorkinvestor George Soros said it was dissatisfied with FairchildIndustries Inc management and was considering boosting itsholdings to as much as 49.9 pct of the aerospace and aviationcompany's outstanding stock.    The group already controls 1,647,481 Fairchild Industriesshares or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding.    The group said it filed on Wednesday with federal antitrustregulators for advance clearance to buy enough additionalshares to increase its total stake to up to 49.9 pct of thetotal outstanding stock.    The group said its representatives had met with FairchildIndustries officials to inform them "that they do not believemanagement has been successful in enhancing or protectingshareholder values."    It said it was considering the additional share purchasesto enable it to "assert a greater degree of influence over thefuture management and policies of the issuer."    It said a decision on the specific level of share ownershipit would seek depended on market prices, future changes inmanagement policies, available financial resources and otherfactors.    The group said it also reserved the right to pursue othermeasures intended to influence Fairchild management andpolicies, either alone or in concert with other investors.    The group includes Soros and Quantum Fund, an offshoreinvestment firm headquartered in Curacao, Netherlands Antillesthat is advised by Soros.    The group said that since its last SEC filing, made Jan. 2,it had purchased no additional Fairchild shares and had sold6,700 shares on the New York Stock Exchange Jan. 19.    A Fairchild Industries official later said Soros had toldthe company he was not dissatisfied with its management.    "Contrary to the filing, Mr. Soros has told the companytoday that he is not dissatisfied with management," Fairchild'sBill Fulwider told Reuters.    However, Fulwider said the company would have nothing tosay at this time about Soros' disclosure that he may buy upenough additional Fairchild shares to hold as much as 49.9 pctof the company's outstanding stock.

PAYLESS CASHWAYS <PCI> SEES BETTER FIRST QTR Payless Cashways Inc chairman DavidStanley told analysts the company's first quarter results to bereported March 17 will be better than the seven cts per sharereported in the year ago quarter.

Stanley also said that 1987 full year sales will be inexcess of 1.8 billion dlrs as compared to the 1.5 billion dlrsreported in 1986. He also said that analysts' estimates of 1.55dlr per shr for 1987 "are not crazy."    Payless reported net income of 1.22 dlr per share in 1986.    "The economy may not get a lot better, but we expect ouradvantages in the lumber industry and cost cutting measures tokeep us competitive," Larry Kunz, chief financial officer,said.     The company acquired Knox Lumber Co for about 24.3 mlndlrs in October 1986.    Stanley said the company's stronger-than-optimal balancesheet will enable it to make further acquisitions but nonegotiations are going on at the current time.    He said some benefits of a new management informationsystem will be felt in 1987 and more substantially in 1988.   REUTER...^M

DART SAID LIKELY SUPERMARKETS GENERAL SUITOR Dart Group <DARTA> is likely seeking tobuy Supermarkets General <SGL>, analysts said.    "There's been rumors that they've taken a position in thecompany, said Wood Gundie analyst Edward Comeau.    Last year, Dart Group, owner of Auto Trak INc and CrownBooks, competed against Kohlberg, Kravis to acquire SafewayStores INc.    The company later reached an accord under which it wouldbuy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed itsleveraged buyout of the company.    The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mlnto 200 mln dlrs, according to analysts.     Dart Group Corp was not immediately available for comment.    Jerry Ballan, analyst with Conner Ballan division of EdwardViner and Co, said, "They <Dart> has been rumored to be buyingsome other supermarkets as well, such as Stop and Shop."    "My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to bebought out," said Ballan.    Analysts, however, said Supermarkets General is facingproblems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations,which might make it difficult to thwart a bid.    Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrsa share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on apost stock split basis.    For the first quarter, Comeau predicts the company willearn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago, and shouldearn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987.    "But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due toPurity Supreme in New England," Comeau said.    He said competition among supermarkets is getting heated inthat area and that the company has had difficulty withintegrating Purity Supreme with its Pathmark store operations.    Rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due tothe state of that industry, and has reported lower returns asan operating unit, according to analysts.    Analysts said that if Dart buys Supermarkets General itwould probably divest the company's operations.    Analyst Comeau said "supermarkets general may seek acombination with another supermarket company."

ULTRAMAR SAYS FOURTH QUARTER SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS Ultramar Plc <UMAR.L> said that whileits fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational pointof view, several special charges adversely affected results.    Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstreamoperations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices anddownstream operations also affected in the first half by largelosses on inventories.    But margins improved in the second half and in particularrefining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a goodrecovery.    The company was commenting on results that showed a netloss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in1985.    The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stgprovision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialledby Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquidnatural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownershipof Gulf Canada's marketing assets.    Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of afurther reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by awithdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling itsU.S. Flag shipping operation.    The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertainalthough it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increasein the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimisticprices would strengthen over the longer term.    Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas putit in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.    In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improveprofitability by selling or restructuring weak operations whilestrengthening core businesses and developing a soundoperational and financial base.    Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalledabout 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis.    Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from181p at last night's close.

HIGHVELD (HGVJ.J) SEES LOWER 1987 EARNINGS Highveld Steel and Vanadium CorpLtd said it expects 1987 earnings will be lower than lastyear's previously reported 85 cts a share.    But profits "will be at a satisfactory level," the companysaid in the annual report without giving a specific estimate.    Highveld said it expects appreciation of the rand will beoffset to some extent by increasing U.S. Dollar prices for itsexports as the year progresses.    Highveld said measures taken last year by the EuropeanEconomic Community and the United States prohibiting all SouthAfrican steel products "presents a challenge to management toplace the steel in other areas."    The company said overall world vanadium consumption in 1987is expected to be similar to last year although China's role isstill an unknown factor in the total supply-demand situation.

NEW WORLD PICTURES TO HAVE GAIN FROM SALE OF FIVE PCT OF TAFT BROA Jamaica agreed in principle with itsbank advisory committee on a rescheduling of 181 mln dlrs offoreign commercial bank debt falling due between 1987 and 1989,the Jamaican Information Service said.    Repayments on the debt will be stretched out over 12 yearswith 8-1/2 years' grace at 1-1/4 percentage points over theLondon Interbank Offered Rate, Libor. The margin on previouslyrestructured debt also will be cut to 1-1/4 point from 2-1/2.    The package should save Jamaica about 3.3 mln dlrs a year.    Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who led the Jamaicandelegation, called the terms very favourable to his country.    The agreement in principle with the bank advisory committeeled by the Bank of Nova Scotia <BNO.TO> comes five days afterJamaica successfully concluded a 125.5 mln dlr reschedulingaccord with the Paris Club of creditor nations.    That pact in turn followed the International Monetary Fund(IMF)'s approval on March 5 of a 85 mln special drawing rightsstandby arrangement and a 40.9 mln sdr drawing under thecompensatory financing facility.    Of Jamaica's foreign debt of 3.3 billion dlrs only 12 pctis owed to commercial banks, and Seaga yesterday reaffirmed thegovernment's policy of not seeking new bank loans.REUTER...^M

CREDITANSTALT SEES HIGHER 1987 DIVIDEND Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> islikely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12pct of share capital, deputy general-director GuidoSchmidt-Chiari said.    The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previousyear and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's sharecapital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986from 2.7 billion a year earlier.    Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference whenthe bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profitof 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.    Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.    The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total roseto 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.    General director Hannes Androsch said higher investmentwould lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Lastyear's better profits had resulted from improvements inservices provided by the bank and also in profits on schillinglending.    Schilling lending had grown last year and interest ratemargins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory whencompared with those in other countries, he said.    Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home andabroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits,Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.    Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business hadfallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations,removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheettotal.    In an attempt to generate more foreign business,representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, HongKong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans toabolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares anddrawing dividends.    Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt roseeight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokerssaid improved results had been widely expected by investors.    Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria'slargest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized andlarge Austrian companies.    But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG <SDPV.VI> would return a 1987 result similarto the expected 1986 operating loss of 700 mln schillings. REUTER

JC PENNEY <JCP> UP ON SMITH BARNEY OPINION J.C. Penney Co's stock rose sharply after analyst William Smith of Smith Barney recommended thestock, based on the company's strong earnings momentum and thepossibility of a stock buyback, dividend hike or stock split,traders said.    "I am very impressed with the strong basic earnings story,"analyst Smith said, noting that the company has "fine tuned itsbuying and inventories, and has admirably controlled costs in atime that they needed to."    The stock jumped 2-1/2 to 98-3/4.    Smith said the company ended 1986 with a strong cashposition of about 639 mln dlrs as compared to 158 mln dlrs theyear before. "This implies the possibility of a share buyback,or significant dividend increase or a stock split," he said.    In addition, he said the company has been graduallyadjusting its merchandise mix and its gross margins have beenimproving.    Smith expects the company to earn 8.25-to-8.50 dlrs a sharein 1987 as compared to the 7.06 dlrs a share earned last year.Last year's results include a 69 cent charge for the buyback ofdebt. Reuter

He also expects the company to raise its annual dividendabout 20 to 30 cts a share, from its current dividend of 3.20dlrs a share, "and a stock split is possible but it has a lowprobablility."

SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks arereporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasingprovisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non-performing loans.    Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to buildreserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline alittle this year.    But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problemshampering traditional lending operations mean earnings willremain vulnerable.    One senior bank credit officer said "The work is largelydone in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions,but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money."    The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - hastaken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results nowappearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broaddecline.    The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks hadsunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before worldoil prices tumbled.    Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate onthe Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported andrevealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 atthe expense of increased provisions.    The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, <United SaudiCommercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mlnriyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln.    Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in partreflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearlytrebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985.    Other results released so far show <Saudi American Bank>(SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7mln riyals, while <Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as SaudiFrench, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals.    Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's <CCI.N>Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez,increased provisions sharply.    <Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mlnriyals.    Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non-performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in theSaudi economy bottoms out.    Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economicactivity, but one banker said "The top 50 pct of the Saudi banksare now at or close to international levels on provisions."    From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank <NationalCommercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals inprovisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to theprivate sector, bankers calculated.    Between 1982 and 1985, <Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as thesecond biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, hadcovered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operateon an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine.    Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has beentightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule fordeclaring loans as non-performing.    Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figuresdifficult because some banks still book non-accruing interestas revenue while others follow more conservative practices inforce in major world financial centres.    Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and thejoint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rankas the strongest earners.    Other banks such as <Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned bythe <British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by arelatively low deposit base.    Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mlnriyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show anotherlow figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the mostconservative in making provisions.    Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see aSaudi bank go under and not only supported <Saudi Cairo Bank>after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also madeavailable cheap deposits to <Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB.    The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, butgenerally banks are awash with liquidity since they areunwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans.    And while banks in more liberal financial markets canattempt to diversify away from traditional lending,conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generatefee income from new investment banking products.    One banker said "Operating earnings in the Kingdom are notgood."    Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount ofadvances is showing a declining trend, while the days whenbanks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts toinvest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better returnon their money.    In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to currentaccounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customerfunds are held on current account. REUTER
JAPANESE CORPORATE EARNINGS RECOVERY PREDICTED Japanese corporate earnings will rise 8.9pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first year-on-year increase inthree years, partly because of the yen's stable exchange rate,the Nomura research institute said.    Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 1.9 pct inthe year, which starts April 1, the research arm of NomuraSecurities Co said in a statement.    Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in thecurrent fiscal year with sales forecast to drop 14 pct.    The forecast assumes an average rate of 148.5 yen to thedollar in 1987/88, compared with 160 yen in the current year.    Corporate efforts to cope with the yen's appreciation, suchas cutting production costs, are expected to bear fruit nextfiscal year, the institute said. The economy should alsobenefit from pump-priming expected from the government and ahalt in rising prices of manufactured goods, it said.    Recurrent profits of manufacturing industries are projectedto rise 29.6 pct next fiscal year against an estimated 40.1 pctfall in the current year.    Non-manufacturing sector profits will decline 4.5 pct in1987/88 against an estimated 2.2 pct rise in the current year,it said. REUTER
BOLIDEN SAYS RESULTS BURDENED BY LOSS WRITEOFF Swedish mining and metals groupBoliden AB <BLDS ST> forecast a return to profitability during1987 after recording a 1.08 billion crown 1986 loss burdened bya massive write-off.    The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale andinvestment conglomerate <Ahlsell AB> this year, said the resultincluded restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns.    "These costs have arisen as a results of a change ofdirection for the group. They are mainly one-off but they haveburdened the annual accounts," the company said in a statement.    Boliden said the company's liquid assets were 1.36 billioncrowns at year-end which together with an investment portfolioof 1.60 billion made it one of the most liquid Swedishcompanies.    As a result of the 1986 losses, the board proposedcancelling dividend for the year although it predicted a returnto profitability during 1987, the statement added.    Swedish tyres, process equipment and components firm<Trelleborg AB> has taken a majority stake in Boliden since thebeginning of this year.

ROWNTREE REPORTS PRETAX PROFIT AT 84 MLN STG Rowntree Mackintosh Plc <RWNT.L>announced it made a pretax profit of 84 mln stg in the 53 weeksending January 3, 1987, compared with 79.3 mln stg in theprevious year.    Turnover was up to 1.29 billion stg from 1.2 billion. Afinal dividend of 9.2p was proposed, after a final 8.2p lastyear. Earnings per share rose to 35p from 34.8p.    The results were broadly in line with market expectations,leaving shares at 499p in early trading, up one pence fromyesterday's close, but slightly off pre-announcement openinglevels.    Profit on ordinary activities after tax was 66.2 mln stg,up from the previous year's 60.7 mln.    The U.K. Remained Rowntree's largest centre for tradingprofits, accounting for 47.9 mln stg, up from 45.3 mln in 1985.Profit from its second largest geographical area, NorthAmerica, slipped to 34.7 mln stg from 37.2 mln. North Americanprofits were affected by the fall of the value of the dollar.    Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg intrading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made inAustralasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest ofthe world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year.    Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a16.5 mln debit previously. A company spokesman said thisrepresented additional provisions for the cost ofrationalisation plans announced in earlier years.    Rowntree expects North American operations will this year,ahead of company expectations, be of the same order as thosefrom the U.K. And the rest of Europe combined, the statementsaid. A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast.    Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide,including further moves in the speciality retailing businesswhich Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said.    Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast bychairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performanceof seven businesses bought last year was encouraging.    The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share andincreased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concernincreased profit and Rowntree's small health food business,Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said.    Offsetting factors included currency movements, which costthe company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profitson confectionery operations, and the company faced strongcompetition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets. REUTER

Group turnover should rise about seven pct from the 15.7mln reported for this year, while group investments shouldtotal around 1.8 billion francs, somewhat above the 1.3 billionannual average of the past three years, he added.    Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the group'sleisure industry, health and communications activities, Monodsaid.    In the leisure sector the group planned a joint developmentwith Club Mediterranee <CMI.PA>, Club Med, of a 200 hectarepleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of EasternCentral France, he said.    Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de DeveloppementTouristique would carry out the construction work and financialplanning of the development which would be leased to Club Medas operator of the complex, he said.    He gave no financial details but said leisure sectorinvestments would total about 100 mln francs over the nextthree years.    Investments in the communications industry would go mainlyto develop the group's cable television activities and its 25pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recentlywon the concession to operate a sixth television channel inFrance.    Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mlnfrancs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eauxwould provide about 175 mln, Monod said.    Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audienceshare and to capture about 10 pct of the national televisionadvertising market.    Total investment by the group in the communications sector,including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in thecoming year.    Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mlnand 200 mln over the five years, with the aim of widening theaudience to 280,000 subscribers from 12,000, and boostingturnover to around 450 mln francs a year from 10 mln.

JACOBS SUCHARD EXPECTS ANOTHER EXCELLENT YEAR Jacobs Suchard AG <JACZ.Z> hopes foranother excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading inthe right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.    The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swissfrancs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividendper bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.    Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded thecompany's target of five pct real annual growth, had been madepossible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.    Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economicaffairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24billion francs was due to currency factors.    A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offsetby growth in operations and by structural changes within thegroup.    Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francsfrom 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolatesector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. Thetonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices andlower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.    Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germanyto 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result ofacquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25pct against 25.3 pct.    Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pctfrom 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despitewrite-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A furtherincrease in tax levels was expected in future.    Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mlnthe previous year. REUTER

SOUTHWEST REALTY <SWL> HAS LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS Southwest Realty Ltd said it believes itcould make all of its scheduled montly debt service paymentsfor 1987 despite the falloff in its rental operations, butmaking the payments would probably severely impair itsliquidity and restrict its ability to maintain the quality ofits properties.    The company today reported a 1986 loss of 1,544,000 dlrscompared with a 1985 profit of 3,912,000 dlrs.    Southwest said in addition to its monthly scheduyled debtservice payments, a 1,743,000 dlr loan on one of its Houstonproperties is due to mature on April One.    Southwest said a commitment to reduce the interest rate andextend the Houston loan for one year has been accepted.    It said talks are underway with lenders on other Houstonproperties to obtain partial debt service moratoriums which, ifgranted, would cut 1987 cash deficits from 1986 levels.  Theloan renegotiations could involve bankruptcy or otherlitigation connected with the specific properties involved andcould involve the suspension of interest and principal paymentsto some of the lenders.  Southwest said if the attempts torestructure debt do not succeed, it could lose one or more ofthe properties.    Southwest said the Houston properties made up about 10 pctof its current value equity as of December 31 of 14.20 dlrs pershare, down from 16.68 dlrs a year before.    The company said depending on the success of the talks andoperating results for 1987, one or two more properties couldbecome subject to similar negotiations.

SAND TECHNOLOGY <SNDCF> MULLING REVERSE SPLIT Sand Technology Systems Inc said it isconsidering a reverse stock split of at least one-for-10 andexpects to report a second-quarter profit, compared to a losslast year.    The stock consolidation "is something we're discussing, butit's not definite," Sand Technology president Jerry Shattnertold Reuters in an interview.    A private placement recently brought the number ofoutstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July31, 1986, the fiscal yearend.    "The company has always had the aura of a penny stock,"Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to applyfor listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange.    Shattner said the company expects to report a profit offive pct, or about 350,000 dlrs, on sales of seven mln dlrs,for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the thirdquarter should be about the same as the second, he added.    Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195dlrs in the second quarter.    After "a disastrous first quarter," Sand hopes to break evenin the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company hasscaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the33.5 mln dlrs projected in December.    The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. andCanadian dollars last year led to Sand's loss of 2.1 mln dlrs,or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs.    In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585dlrs.    Shattner believes the company will post better results thisyear due to several factors.    "Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buyingproducts in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachiin U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in thesecond quarter," he said.    Sand Technology sells, under its trademark, computeraccessories such as disk drives, solid-state memory enhancementdevices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd <HIT> ofJapan.    Shattner said Sand's affiliate in Detroit, ST Systems Inc,is developing software that lets large maniframe computershandle large databases and share them between applications.    It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens, whichis artificial intelligence computer language for use by majorcorporations.    The company has also reduced costs through some staffcutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staffinstead of straight commissions, Shattner said.    And Sand plans to market a laser printer in the fourthfiscal quarter, Shattner said. Reuter

K MART <KM> SAYS RECORD 1986 NET "TURNING POINT" K Mart Corp said its record fiscal1986 net earnings of 582.3 mln dlrs, a rise from 221.2 mln dlrsa year ago, marked a "major turning point" for the world'ssecond biggest retailer.    K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter endedJanuary 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from "merchandising, refurbishing and expense control."    A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs fordiscontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retailoperations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs ashare compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago.    K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said "the success of theseprograms is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increasein 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxesto 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reachedthis milestone."    Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prioryear. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinuedoperations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over1985, it said.    Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumeracceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, "a marked increasein hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution fromspecialty retailing operations."    K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income fromcontinuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.    K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pctfrom 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general andadministrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pctin 1985.    "Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for KMart," Fauber said in a statement.    "In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused onchanging the look of our stores and the structure of thecompany."    K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for storeremodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system,upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialtyretailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructuredits long-term debt.    "We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form ofslower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investmentcommunity. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985,our improved performance is proof that our approach is correctfor the long term," the K Mart chairman said. Reuter

PHILLIPS <P> TO EMPHASIZE CASH FLOW TO PARE DEBT Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasizeimproving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt,C.J. "Pete" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview.    "Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assetsalready installed," he said, but he declined to estimate annualcash flow for 1987.    Analysts estimate Phillips" cash flow at over one billiondlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted fromrestructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hoversabout 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986.     Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raisingthe capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gasproperties.    "We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cashflow prospects," he said. He projected a capital expenditurebudget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mlndlrs.    Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration andproduction, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silassaid.    "Phillips' top priority in 1987 will be to get thewaterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields toimprove our ability to extract oil and increase earnings," Silassaid.     Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected tocost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln grossbarrels of oil over a period of 24 years.    Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silassaid he was seeking "a modification of terms with the Chinesegovernment to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijangfields) commercially viable."    In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the PointArguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. "Weexpect to start up the first platform then," Silas said.    But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced thecompany to part with several oil and gas assets.    Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K.North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that isnow completed, Silas said.     "We sold high cost producing assets. They were not goodvalue for us but possibly so for someone else," Silas said.    Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earningsfor the company.    "Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and weare using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales, whileregrettable, were necessary to reduce debt," Silas said.    He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oilprices don't fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels  forseveral months. "Then, everyone would be looking at sales (ofassets), and we're no different from the others," Silas said.    In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings fromPhillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs inearnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985.    "This was our second best year pushed by a good supply anddemand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costsfor our operations," Silas said, "In 1987 we think the market'ssupply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstockand energy costs will rise due to price recovery."

BRITISH TELECOM CAUTIOUS ON EARNINGS PROSPECTS British Telecommunications Plc's <BTY.L>profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced byincreasing competition and continued costs for replacing oldtelephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said.    Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter resultswhich were released earlier today, Odgers said the companyfaced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systemsin Britain for three to five years.    He said <Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and WirelessPlc <CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor.    Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into someof British Telecom's most profitable areas.    One company official privately estimated that BritishTelecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunicationsmarket but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct.    The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, whichlead to some disruption in service, could well have encouragedclients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said.    However, he forecast that the last quarter's resultsoverall should not be adversely affected by the walkout.    He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls shouldbe limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities.    But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength,economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growthindustry will help produce annual profit increases for theforseeable future.    British Telecom will also seek to expand intomanufacturing, he said, adding that research and developmentexpenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared withthe current proportion of two pct of overall turnover.    Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helpedshares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday'sclose and off an early high of 248p.    Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd saidthe market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a sevento eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profitover the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-taxprofit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion.    Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linkingcharges to inflation meant that the company's scope for raisingprices was limited as long as inflation remains low. Reuter

NORD EST PLANS 400 MLN FRANC BOND ISSUE Financial and industrial holding companyNord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of400 mln francs, President Gustave Rambaud said.    He told a news conference Nord-Est expected to receiveapproval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next twoweek, when terms would set according to market conditions.

Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mlnfrancs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against147 mln, was attributable to the group.

SCHWEIZERHALLE FIRE HIT SANDOZ 1986 PROFITS Sandoz AG <SANZ.Z> wouldhave reported a percentage rise in net profits "close to doublefigures" rather than the actual two pct had it not been forNovember's warehouse fire, a senior company official said.    The official, who declined to be identified, told ReutersSandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope withthe consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, whichcaused severe pollution of the Rhine.    Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profitsto 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pctincrease in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share.    This year began well, with the performance in January andFebruary at least equal to the same period last year, theofficial said.    The company is expected to give fuller details of itsresults at a news conference on April 22.    Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to coverany liability arising from the accident.    The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the"one pct" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntarygestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollutionfrom the fire.    Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have beenflowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering theRhine since the accident.    However, the official said the final figure would be "muchless than that cited in earlier comments." He gave no furtherdetails.    In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy <CIGZ.Z>,which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were alsohit by the falling dollar, the official said.    Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, withmarket share increases in the United States and Japan. But thiswas more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchangeeffect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said.    Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billionfrancs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs.    The third major Swiss chemical company, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche and Co <HOFZ.Z> has not yet reported its results. REUTER
ALUSUISSE SEES POSSIBLE BREAK-EVEN IN 1987 Schweizerische Aluminimum AG <ALUZ.Z>(Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansingits balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said.    "The threshold of profitability has returned to theforeseeable future," he said. "We expect already in 1987approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, thatour industrial environment does not worsen."    He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of pastlosses.    Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.    Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion andnet turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.    Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for1985.    But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a newsconference the new management installed a year ago had decidedto restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminaterights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as anasset.    Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took angross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from472 mln in 1985.    It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining,after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiaryin the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in1985.    Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves andexceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.    Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this "radicalelimination of the mortgages of the past" painful, but said thefoundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.    Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity wasstrong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion.    Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pctin 1985.    In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse hadarranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank ofSwitzerland <SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp <SBVZ.Z> and CreditSuisse <CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into asubordinated loan.    The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and notcash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used onlyto a small extent, and the parent company had been granted anew credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swissbanks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.    Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintainingbauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.    That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc lossinstead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.    The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similaralternations were made for previous years.    After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895mln francs. REUTER
JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS IN LAST 1986 QUARTER UP Current profits of Japan's major firms inthe October-December quarter rose four pct from a year earlierto 5,654 billion yen against a 2.6 pct year-on-year rise in thepreceding quarter, the Finance Ministry said.    The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 22.5 pctprofit increase in non-manufacturing industries, supported byan 88.7 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain inreal estate, according to a ministry survey.    Total sales of the 15,308 firms with capital of 10 mln yenor more which responded to the poll, fell one pct to 217,217billion yen against a 1.2 pct fall the previous quarter.    Current profits of manufacturing industries in the fourthquarter dropped 13.7 pct to 2,394 billion yen against a 22.1pct fall in the preceding quarter, the ministry said.    Plant and equipment investments of all firms polled fell3.9 pct to 8,004 billion yen, compared with a 1.4 percent fallthe previoius quarter.    Ministry officials said the survey showed that the Japaneseeconomy is in a delicate stage in which it is hard to tell ifeconomic growth has stopped deteriorating or if the economy isheading for a recovery.

CITROEN EXPECTS HIGHER PROFITS, HELPED BY AX Automobiles Citroen expects risingsales of its new AX compact car to help boost profitssignificantly this year, continuing a financial recovery aftersix straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said.    Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AXsports model, he said: "All the budgetary forecasts that we havebeen able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvementin 1987, compared with 1986," he added.    Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA <PEUP.PA> group,increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct infirst two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It isaiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after11.7 pct in 1986.    The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of theEuropean market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from2.9 pct in 1986.    "Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet thedemand," Calvet said. "This is a relatively new problem for us."    Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cutthe deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to moderniseits range and improve productivity.    Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs.    This weekend he said that those profit estimates "remainabout the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic."    Some of this optimism is due to the early success of theAX, launched on the French market last October. It will beavailable throughout most of western Europe within four months.    The car has registered just over 20,000 sales.    It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous-Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany andVigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of1,000 cars a day.    The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate modelbetween its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed tocompete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa.    The AX had built up its market share in France to aroundfour pct last month. Calvet said: "Our hope is that once the AXis fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per centof the national market." REUTER

JAPAN BUSINESS DECLINE SEEN BOTTOMING OUT The extended decline in Japan's overallbusiness performance was likely to bottom out in the currentJanuary-March quarter, the Finance Ministry said.    Improved corporate earnings and better prospects for thestability of the yen had made companies more optimistic, itsaid after carrying out a quarterly survey.    The survey, conducted in February, was based onquestionnaires returned by 8,328 large and small firms in allsectors except the finance and insurance industries.    The survey said overall corporate earnings were expected toturn positive with an estimated 0.4 pct year on year increasein the second half of fiscal 1986 ending on March 31 after a5.4 pct decrease in the first half.    Corporate earnings will grow further in the first half offiscal 1987, rising an estimated 10.7 pct, it added.    Manufacturers' earnings, hit hard by the yen's steady riseagainst the dollar, will rise 7.7 pct in first-half fiscal 1987after falling 10.7 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, itsaid.    Overall earnings of non-manufacturing companies will rise11.8 pct year on year in the first half of fiscal 1987 aftergrowing 9.8 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, the surveysaid.    It said this figure was bolstered by profits of firms suchas electric power and gas companies which have benefitted fromthe yen's appreciation. REUTER

ENDOTRONICS <ENDO> EXPECTS LOSS FOR YEAR Endotronics Inc said it expects toincur "substantial losses" for the second quarter ending March31 and fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1987.    As one factor behind the anticipated loss, Endotronicscited a dispute by one of its Japanese distributors, <YamahaInc>, over payment of a 3,686,000 dlr promissory note.    In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, Endotronics said the note was for overdue accountsreceivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and anotherJapanese distributor during the company's 1986 fiscal year.    Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operationsit will exhaust all currently available cash and creditfacilities in early May 1987. It said this assumes full use ofthe remaining 1,250,000 dlrs available under a line of creditfrom Celanese Corp, which requires approval of Celanese Corp<CZ>.    The company said its ability to obtain funding wasadversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of itsshareholders seeking to represent a class of holders againstthree officers of Endotronics.    Endotronics said the complaint against it allegesviolations of the federal securities laws in connection withstatements made in the company's annual and quarterly reports.    The company also said the Securities Division of theMinnesota Department of Commerce is conducting an inquiry intothe company's Japanese sales for fiscal 1986 and trading byinsiders and brokers in the company's common shares.    It said similar inquiries are being conducted by theSecurities and Exchange Commission. The investigations willhurt the company's ability to obtain funding, it said.    As a result of the dispute over payment of the promissorynote, the law suit challenging its financial data and thevarious investigations concerning insider trading, the companysaid it no longer expects that anticipated declines ininstrument sales in Japan in fiscal 1987 will be offset byincreased instrument sales in other foreign countries and theUnited States.

MRS FIELDS PLANS TO OPEN MORE STORES U.S. Based speciality food retailer <MrsFields Inc>, which earlier announced pre-tax profits of 17.1mln dlrs in 1986 against 6.8 mln in 1985, said it plans furthergrowth this year with the opening of 125 new stores in the U.S.    The company, which is quoted on London's UnlistedSecurities Market (USM), said it also planned to expand itsoutlets internationally.    However, chairman Randall Fields told a news conference thecompany would not move into any new countries during 1987 butwould intensify its efforts where it already had stores.    During 1986 the company opened 81 new stores, including 76in the U.S., Two in Australia and one each in Japan, Canada andthe U.K.    "We intend to open a minimum of five more units in Londonfor example and it is reasonable that we might open otherstores in other European countries in 1988," Fields said.

ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION <Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move uniqueamong Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold globalexpansion that could someday lift the foreign share of itsyearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.    First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analystMichael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target isattainable. But it "will be a tremendous achievement because... they're going to have to build an international earningsbase larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestictrust companies," Walsh said.    Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growththis year against an expected 15 pct jump in total companyprofit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview.    He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.    Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company withassets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operatedinternationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.    Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, whenother Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings andloans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.    The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heighteneddomestic competition and impressive growth at its London bankoperations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980,Cornelissen said.    Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe andAsia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow ChemicalCo <DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included assetmanagement, merchant and private banking companies.    "It was a heaven-sent opportunity," Cornelissen said of theDow Financial acquisition. "We achieved in one year what wouldotherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up."    Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun directcompetition with major global financial institutions inactivities such as international lending and stock brokerage,in order to exploit "profitable niches" overseas in traditionaltrust activities such as asset management, private banking andadvisory services.    He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations"before the end of this month" to sell its London-based SavoryMilln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.    "The international market is so big and we have such aminiscule share of it that growth opportunities are reallylimited only by our energy and our desire to find morebusiness," he said, adding that in trust-type services, "wedon't think the international markets are well-served."    Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in North America and increased Canadianinvestment abroad, Cornelissen said.    Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapideconomic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, saidCornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billiondlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.    Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asiawill contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct ofglobal productive capacity, Cornelissen said, "We knew we hadto be there." Royal Trust's 14 international locations includeoffices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company alsorecently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.    The Royal Trust president said the company was stressinggrowth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee anyacquisitions in the "immediate future," although "we have oureyes wide open for the right opportunities."    Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which thecompany abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units,Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market wellcovered by hundreds of small regional banks.    "That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.,"said Cornelissen. "That is probably one area that we willprobably do something with in the next five years."    He said the company would continue to emphasize its homeCanadian market, which Cornelissen and financial servicesanalysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.    Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks,trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation inone another's actitivies will mean more domestic competitionfor Royal Trust, "but not drastically more," Cornelissen said.

SALOMON RAISES CATERPILLAR <CAT> OPINION Salomon Brothers Inc said it raisedits opinion on Caterpillar Inc's stock to an aggressive buyfrom a hold because of a brighter earnings outlook for 1988.    Salomon analyst David Sutliff said in a statement he sees1988 earnings of 3.35 dlrs a share, up from an earlier forecastof three dlrs for the year. The outlook for 1987 remains at2.50 dlrs to three dlrs.    Caterpillar's stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4.    "Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters,we believe that profits could begin to improve in the secondhalf - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through1988 and 1989," he said.    Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors- higher prices, improved market share, reduced costs, andimproved demand.    The higher prices will stick because its Japanesecompetitor, Komatsu, has had to raise prices because of theincreased value of the yen, he said. Reuter

SMITHKLINE <SKB> AIMS FOR 10 PCT EARNINGS RAISE SmithKline Beckman Corp said it ispursuing a three-point stragey that will achieve a 10 pctannual increase in operating earnings throughout the remainderof the decade.    In 1986, SmithKline earned 521.1 mln dlrs or 6.78 dlrs pershare on revenues of 3.6 billion dlrs.    The company said in its annual report that itsnonpharmaceutical business will play a major role in meetingits earnings growth target, and will in fact grow faster thanits pharmaceutical business.    SmithKline, whose major product is the antiulcer medicationTagamet, said in the report that it intends to improve earningsfrom existing products, expand its product portfolio andoptimize its financial resources.    To bolster its position in the antiulcer market, in whichTagamet has met stiff competition, SmithKline said its strategyto develop an over-the-counter version of Tagamet is bolsteredby two joint ventures, one with <Wellcome PLC>, and one pendingventure in Japan.    SmithKline also said its Allergan Inc eye and skin careproducts division can be a one billion dlr organization in thenext five years that can grow at more than seven to 10 pctannually.    "Nondilutive acquisitions are a real possibility," GavinHerbert, president of the eye and skin care product group saidin the report. In 1986, Allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mlndlrs.    It said its Smith Kline and French Laboratoriespharmaceuticals unit, with 1986 sales of 1.9 billion dlrs, willfile for Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for anumber of cardiovascular agents, including tissue plasminogenactivator, over the next two years.    It also said SK and F's U.S. sales force will be 20 pctlarger in 1987, with more than 1,000 sales personnel.    Smith Kline also said its small clinical laboratory testingunit, with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs, performs 24 mln tests ayear, and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as intesting for the AIDS antibody.    Smith Kline said that depending on its share price and thecost of money, it may buy back more shares. In the last threeyears, it has bought back about 25 pct of its shares.    SmithKline begins the year with a new management team,including its new chief operating officer George Ebright. Reuter
ASHLAND OIL <ASH> SEES 2ND QTR OPER LOSS Ashland Oil Inc said it expects toreport a loss from operations in the second quarter.    The company also said it expects to report a 10 mln dlrsnet gain in the quarter from excess pension funds used to paydown debt. "However, it is difficult to determine now whetherthis gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operatingloss," the company said in a statement. A company spokesmanwould not elaborate.    The company's Ashland Petroleum Co unit operated at a lossin January and February since it was unable to raise productprices enough to recover higher crude oil costs, Ashland said.    Although Ashland Petroleum and SuperAmerica, a retailmarketing operation, are having a difficult quarter, thecompany's Valvoline, Ashland Chemical and coal businesses areexpected to report good results for the quarter ended March 31.    In the year-ago quarter, Ashland had income from operationsof 93.8 mln dlrs before corporate and interest expenses, taxes,equity income and other items.    Net income in the quarter was 39.4 mln dlrs or 1.12 dlrs ashare on sales of 1.78 billion dlrs. Reuter

Clausen said he doubts BankAmerica would be in a positionthis year to make any acquisitions or experience any growth.    He said BankAmerica will continue to reduce staff andoperations, noting that expense growth in 1986 increased onlyone pct over 1985 expenses.

ROYAL BANK/CANADA BRAZIL UNIT SEES GROWTH Royal Bank of Canada's <RY> smallBrazilian commercial bank subsidiary Banco Royal do Canada(Brasil) S.A. sees opportunities for its own growth with anexpected substantial increase in Brazilian exports to Canada,Banco Royal president Michael Brennan said.    "They (Brazilian exporters) are very interested in theCanadian market because it's an untapped market," Brennan toldreporters after a speech to the Brazil/Canada Chamber ofCommerce.    Brennan said Brazil is currently exporting products likepaper machinery and ships to Canada.    He said he hopes to see medium-term financing facilitiesfor Brazilian companies reinstated shortly, following anagreement reached in January with international financialauthorities.    Brennan estimated Brazilian exports to Canada totalledroughly 800 mln Canadian dlrs in 1985 while imports from Canadareached about 700 mln dlrs.    Brennan said he expects Banco Royal profit to increase thisyear from the three mln U.S. dlrs reported for fiscal 1986ended September 30 but said he could not predict by how muchbecause of the country's uncertain financial climate.    Brennan said he expects his bank's growth to come fromincreased exports to Canada. Banco Royal is the onlyCanadian-owned commercial bank in Brazil although <Bank ofMontreal> has a Brazilian investment bank subsidiary, he said.    Brennan said he expected Brazil to be able to reach anequitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68billion U.S. dlr foreign debt, because the Brazilian economy isessentially healthy. He said he believed Brazil might be in aposition to resume debt repayments within a year.    Brennan said he could not comment on the impact of Brazil'sinterest payment moratorium on the Royal Bank of Canada. Reuter

CENTEL <CNT> SEES LOWER FIRST QTR PROFITS Centel Corp said it sees 1987 firstquarter results below those of 1986 due to regulatory limits ontelephone earnings and 15 cts to 20 cts a share dilution from1986 acquisitions.    In the annual report, Chairman Robert Reuss toldshareholders telephone profits will continued to be limited byceilings imposed by regulators as well as deregulation andstructural changes within the industry that have slowed growthin the investment base for setting rates.    As such, its first quarter 1987 results will be below lastyear's first quarter of 1.11 dlrs a share, he said.    "Several of the company's telephone units may be faced witha reduction in the rates of return authorized by theirregulators," Reuss said.

CATHAY PACIFIC 1986 PROFIT SEEN ABOVE TARGET Buoyed by low fuel prices andfavourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's<CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline'sforecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said.    Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earningsof between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reportsresults tomorrow for its first year as a public company.    Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HK>, madeits earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation inMay last year.    Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, makinga total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in theprospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said.    They said the airline's performance improved in the secondhalf of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mlndlrs.    The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to oneU.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company'sfavour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the timeof the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said.    James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airlineindustry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices wouldaffect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profitsof 1.25 billion dlrs.     Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price andcurrency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative.    "This is reflected in their interim results which showedthat profit margin has increased," said Frederick Tsang ofMansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.    Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlierlevels, but profits rose 69 pct.    The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact onthe company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel pricesusually lag behind crude price movements by several months,analysts said.    By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against theHong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct andsterling 12 pct.    "Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar againstCathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yieldsin the first half up 7.2 pct," said James Capel. "This shouldcontinue through the second half to enable passenger yields toend the year up 7.6 pct."    A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cashunder management also improved profits, James Capel said.    A general improvement in air traffic last year contributedto Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factordeclined because of increased competition and an expansion ofits fleet and services.    James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flownlast year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flownclimbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fellto 68.8 pct from 70 pct.    "Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routeslast year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,"said Tsang. "This affected its load factor."    Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier <HongKong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay'sdecision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analystssaid. REUTER

REYNOLD METALS <RLM> UP ON FURMAN SELZ REPORT Shares of Reynolds Metals Co rosesharply after Wall Street firm Furman Selz Mager Dietz andBirney issued a report focusing on the strong earningspotential from the company's Australian gold holding, tradersfamiliar with the report said.    Traders said the report notes that earnings from Australiangold holdings could be worth about 35 cts to 55 cts a sharethis year and 1.40 dlrs to two dlrs a share in 1988.    Reynolds Metals rose three points to 59-5/8 on volume of729,500 shares.    Reynolds owns stakes in the Mount Gibson gold project andthe Boddington gold project, both located in Australia. Ananalyst familiar with the two mines said "the properties,together, have a potential value of 20 dlrs to 40 dlrs a sharefor Reynolds."    The analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the risein the stock today was likely the result of "U.S. investorsthat were not completely cognizant of the size or theimportance of the (Reynolds') holdings in Australia."    Traders said the Furman Selz report indicates that gold wasdiscovered mixed with bauxite in the Boddington mine.Boddington is principally a bauxite mine.    The traders said the report goes on to say that the profitsfrom the Boddington gold with substantially reduce theproduction costs of the other metals mined at Boddington.    Traders said Furman Selz also boosted its earningsestimates, expecting Reynolds Metals to earn 4.10 dlr a sharein 1987 and eight dlrs a share in 1988.    Last year, Reynolds reported net earnings of 8.18 dlrs ashare, which included 3.09 dlrs a share for adoption of newaccounting rules, 1.01 dlrs a share for tax loss carryforwardsand other extraordinary items.

H.J. HEINZ <HNZ> POISED FOR RECORD YEAR H.J. Heinz Co is "within sight of our22nd consecutive year of new records in financial growth" forthe fiscal year ending April 30, Chairman and Chief ExecutiveOfficer Anthony O'Reilly told investment analysts.    O'Reilly, who declined to make a specific projection, saidthe food company is "stronger than at any time in its 118-yearhistory."    Last week Heinz reported third-quarter earnings rose to 55cts a share from 46 cts a share. Sales rose to 1.08 billiondlrs from 1.01 billion dlrs a year earlier.    O'Reilly said Heinz will concentrate on backing its bigbrands, new products and services, new geography, internalgrowth and acquisitions.    He said Heinz Ketchup has its highest market share inhistory, 55 pct. But in response to a question, the executivesaid a volume falloff in the overall product category "is aconcern to us."    O'Reilly said Weight Watchers continues to perform well andwill generate revenue in fiscal 1987 of approximately 940 mlndlrs.    O'Reilly told analysts Heinz is in active negotiations tobuild a second plant in China, where it entered a joint venturewith the government in 1984, forming Heinz-UFE Ltd, whichproduces dry baby food cereal.    He said Heinz-Japan is "making a profit and generating itsfirst substantial dividends," and implementation of a newpartnership, Seoul-Heinz Ltd, is moving ahead with a newmanufacturing plant targeted for completion by June in Seoul,South Korea.    To increase its competitiveness, O'Reilly said Heinzimplemented a "lowest cost imaginable" program targeted atmanufacturing, sales and marketing and procurement.    He said a modernization program is in effect at thecompany's United Kingdom operations, where the labor force,trimmed to 4,000 from 10,000, is expected to be further reducedto 2,500 in 1988. Reuter

Sheikh Ali told Kuwait's daily al-Anba "All OPEC states,without exception, are producing within the quotas allocated tothem. Some of them are producing less."

Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, butan earthquake early this month stopped that.

CATHAY PACIFIC FORECASTS GOOD 1987 PERFORMANCE Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HK>forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth inboth passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year overthe year-earlier period.    The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987but said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co <BA.N> 747freighter and one Boeing 747-300 passenger plane in Septemberand November respectively after it took a 747-300 last month.    It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profitto 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14cents a share.    But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net financecharges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year.    A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraftdeliveries in 1986.    However, the company said in a statement good returns fromfunds placed with investment managers had partly offset higherinterest costs resulting from additional lease financing andother borrowing.    It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuelprices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in1985.    Passengers carried by Cathay Pacific totalled 4.2 mln lastyear, up from 3.85 in 1985, with the passengers kilometretravelled rising to 14.02 billion from 12.56 billion. Butpassenger load factor was down to 69.1 pct from 71.0 pct.

SONY FORESEES CONTINUED SLUMP IN EARNINGS Sony Corp <SNE.T> group net income isexpected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen, ifthe yendollar rate remains at the present level, managingdirector Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference.    Sony will have an irregular five-month business term endingMarch 31, as its financial year will be changed to run fromApril 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.    Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.    The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yenin the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct froma year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.    The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recentappreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in marketprices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.    The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar,reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.    Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 unitsin the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, whileBeta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from onemln due to lower exports to China.    Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrssales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the threemonths compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.    Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its totalproduction in 1990 from the present 20 pct.    Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-monthperiod is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct froma year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct.    Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of groupnet profits and sales in the new financial year starting April1 1987, he added. The company made 41.9 billion yen group netprofit in the year ended November 31 1986, down 42.6 pct from ayear earlier, on sales of 1,325 billion, down 6.7 pct. REUTER

MORGAN GRENFELL SAYS 1986 PROFITS HIT BY GUINNESS <Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> said its1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because ofdepreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> sharesand because of securities trading losses in the U.S.    Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group'sseven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss onits risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits someeight mln stg to 82.2 mln.    He also told a news conference Morgan had received informalapproaches about a takeover of the group but was notinterested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would notelaborate.    Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness duringthe brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc<DIST.L> in the first half of last year.    The U.K. Government launched an investigation into theaffairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focusedon the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and theTakeover Code by prompting others to support its share priceduring the bid.    Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head ofcorporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate financedirector Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinnessaffair.    Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier,resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insiderinformation. He currently faces criminal charges.    Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been "one of themost traumatic in our history," but that clients and staff hadbeen supportive.    "I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We havethe worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet."    Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profitsof 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution fromcorporate finance activities and progress in asset management.    Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference theperformance of the group so far in 1987 was "within reasonabletouch of the budget."    Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a newchief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting asinterim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have anew chief executive within a few months.    He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, butdeclined to say how much each man got.

VW'S AUDI SAYS PROFIT FELL AROUND 50 PCT IN 1986 Audi AG <NSUG.F>, the 99 pct ownedsubsidiary of Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fellby around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previousyear.    Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a newsconference he expected both profit and turnover to rise thisyear compared with 1986, but he said it was questionablewhether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.    He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted lastyear that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecifiedamount from 1985's record levels.    Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10billion this year.    Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help theparent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audiwould ensure VW got a share of profits.    Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own freereserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 yearsVW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.    Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to outputcaused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, oncurrency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. Aboutalleged "sudden acceleration" of some of its Audi 5000 models.    As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pctto 59,800 last year.    Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottomout in 1987.    Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.    Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180in 1985.    Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in thefirst two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overallmarket share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in thesame months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Salesfell further, he said without giving details. Worldwidedeliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to57,000.    Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise toover 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallencompared with 1985's 392,000.    Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead tofurther new hiring of employees.    At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985. REUTER

CONT'L ILLINOIS<CIL> SAYS MORATORIUM MAY CUT NET Continental Illinois Corp said if theBrazilian debt moratorium remains in effect, it may place itsmedium and long term loans to Brazil on a cash basis.    This would increase non-performing loans by about 380 mlndlrs and reduce income before taxes and net income by about 10mln dlrs in the 1987 first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the fullyear, company officials told a press briefing.    Loans to Brazil at 1986 year end totaled 474 mln dlrs,according to the annual report released at the briefing.    In February 1987, the Brazilian government, citing adeclining level of foreign currency reserves, declared amoratorium on the payment of interest on the country's mediumand long term debt obligations.    Continental said it may take similar action on its loans toEcuador, which total 25 mln dlrs.

CONT'L ILLINOIS <CIL> SEES IMPACT FROM TAX REFORM The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have asubstantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company'sannual report says.    One provision repeals the reserve method of providing forbad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets andrequires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, berestored to current earnings status, it said.    As a result, those amounts will be subject to federaltaxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed.    Continental said it decided to deal with this change "inits entirety" in 1987.    Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitationrules, and although the impact will not be material in theshort term, the Act will require, for the first time, thatincome from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the reportsaid.    The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said.    Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, itsaid.    Another provision of the Act could result in limiting theuse of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continentaltakes place, the report said.    This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpsells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the nexttwo years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.    In December, the FDIC sold about one-third of its juniorconvertible preference stock in Continental to the public inthe form of common stock. Reuter

MORRISON KNUDSEN <MRN> SEES YEAR NET FALLING Morrison Knudsen Corp said itsearnings for 1987 are likely to be lower than those for 1986due to lower than expected growth in engineering andconstruction and a previously-predicted decline in earnings ofits National Steel and Shipbuilding unit.

The company said it will remain profitablein 1987 and results should strengthen as the year progresses.

CONT'L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS Continental Illinois Corp's <CIL>Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations toreschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to sixmonths.    Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment ofinterest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium isexpected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talksare under way.    "I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer,for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil'sdebt," Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.    "I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Justhow long the run is is anybody's guess," Swearingen said.    Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritoriummay force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrsand reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the firstquarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.    The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize theseloans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of theContinental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago,Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to aninquiry.    Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and netincome equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.    Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses.Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducingoffice rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.    In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts ashare, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.    The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans andother assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC,during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the1984 restructuring agreement with the government.    The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that itis entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987,Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate lossrather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.    In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle marketrose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.    Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bankwould like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 itbought three small suburban banks.    Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will betaken over because no bank in the Midwest region is largeenough to buy it, and New York money center banks areprohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.    He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over whowill eventually own the firm because it still holds theequivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.    The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and hassaid it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. Theagency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984bailout of the bank.    Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head thestruggling banking firm after a career as an oil industryexecutive, said he will retire when the three-year period heagreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would notcomment on a successor.    The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago optionsclearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said itsdoubtful lending to Japan will occur because that countrydoesn't need external sources of cash.

A share buyback program started last year reduced thenumber of shares outstanding to 82.6 mln at year-end 1986 from97.2 mln dlrs the end of 1985, adjusted for the split.    The food and grocery products company also said it was thesubject of five stockholder lawsuits and one class action suit,filed last November and December in Delaware, New York and NewJersey.    The suits are related to the company's purchase of itsshares from Salomon Brothers Inc after Salomon bought a blockof the stock from Ronald Perelman, who had acquired nearly 3.7mln CPC shares, or 7.6 pct of the company, last year.

CAROLINA POWER <CPL> CANCELS GENERATING UNIT Carolina Power and Light Co saidits board has decided to cancel coal-fired Mayo Unit Two, thesecond unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County, N.C.    The company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only aboutone pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in1992.    Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been underreview because of a decision by the North CarolinaEnvironmental Management Commission that would have requiredthe unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removingscrubbers.    Carolina Power said Unit One, which has been in operationsince 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbersthrough the use of low-sulphur coal, and "The addition ofscrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginalair quality improvements."    The company said it will be able to purchase lower-costpower from Duke Power Co <DUK> for intermediate and peakingpurposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two withscrubbers.  It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for laterdevelopment of a generating unit.    Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  "Thehigher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, wouldincrease the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two withscrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year."    A company spokesman said the company has already spentabout 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet beenmade of the cost of canceling the plant, but the company doesnot expect to take a charge against earnings.

New England Electric is the operator of thisventure as well as owning 51 pct of the project.    The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mlndlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmissionlines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.    New England Electric said internally generated funds willcover all of its power plant construction costs this year and65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units planto spend in 1987.    The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs onits oil and gas activities this year, adding internallygenerated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.    New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrsworth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additionalhigher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unitplans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this yearas well.    The company said it does not plan to offer common sharesthis year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raiseabout 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under itsdividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.    President Samuel Huntington told the analysts theconstruction spending projection is based on the expectationthat demand for electricity in the New England electric systemwill grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.    However, the utility cannot ignore the potential forsharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.    He attributed this growth to declining electricity pricesand a strong New England economy.    Huntington said New England Elecetric has "all but rejectednew coal fired plants" to supply additional power.    He said the most attractive new power supplies are thosewith short lead times which can be built in modules.    Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility islooking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supplymost of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-firedfluidized bed units.    He explained that fluidized bed technology is available inmodular units, adding that Huntington was referring to thetraditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal. Reuter

CPI CORP <CPIC> TO POST HIGHER 1986 RESULTS CPI Corp said it expects to posthigher sales and earnings for its fiscal year ended February 7when it officially reports results in three weeks.    It said preliminary figures show total sales of 258 mlndlrs, up 30 pct from 198 mln dlrs in its 1985 fiscal year. Netearnings from continuing operations rose to 18 mln dlrs, upalmost 31 pct from 13.9 mln dlrs, while per share earnings fromcontinuing operations were 2.22 dlrs, up 23 pct from 1.80 dlrs.There were 552,500 additional shares outstanding.

LAIDLAW TRANSPORTATION <LDMFA> SEES BETTER YEAR Laidlaw Transportation Ltd saidearnings per share for the current fiscal year should increaseby "substantially more" than the 30 pct average annual growthexperienced in the last four years.    Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unitacquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlawpresident Michael de Groote told analysts.    Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.    De Groote also said the company expects "excellent results"in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be morespecific.    He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does notinclude possible further acquisitions and said that theaddition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988through fiscal 1990.    De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous fourquarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. Therest came from acquisitions, he said.    Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this willnot make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.    He also said he is "not very optimistic" about the ongoingnegotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-basedchemical and solid waste services company with Canadian andU.S. operations, from <Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.    De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of theproposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within thenext 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemicalwaste business through GSX Corp.    "We feel it is a profitable business with good growthpotential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the rightmanagement," de Groote said.    Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.    De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs incash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants.    De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 willrepresent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses willcontribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.    The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performingwell and there are no plans to sell it, he said.    He would not estimate the contribution of each segment toearnings per share for the year. He also said that furtheracquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likelywithin the next few months. Reuter

U.S. BANK INCOME SHOWS FIRST DROP IN 25 YEARS Problems in the farmbelt andoilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overallincome for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal DepositInsurance Corp (FDIC) said.    The nation's 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985's record 18.1billion dlrs.    The total was still the second highest ever reported, butit was the first time income had not grown since 1961.    The figures reflected a radical split in the health ofbanks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.    In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, whileone in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.    Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDICsaid in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profilesit planned to issue.    "I don't remember a time when there was such a cleardistinction by geographic area," FDIC Chairman William Seidmantold reporters.    He said that while the figures were not good, they showedthe problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole butwith regional differences in economic performance.    Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as manyas failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubtedthe pace would continue.     On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in thenumber of new problem banks in all regions except theSouthwest, Seidman said.    Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourthquarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from ayear ago.    Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs ormore -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDICsaid.    Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil'smoratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.    He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedomto run their banks and that an increase in failures was to beexpected.    But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meantother banks that were better managed have gotten stronger,Seidman said. Reuter

LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN '87 Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG[OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record amoderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mlnschilling net profit made in 1986, General Director GerhardWagner said.    Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pctrise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due togreater domestic business and wider margins on schillinginterest rates.    The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividendto 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capitalfrom 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.    Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: "We will endeavourto maintain the higher dividend in 1987."    Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreigncurrency business last year accounted for some 37 pct ofbalance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.    Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign businesschiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which iseffectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wipedsome 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.    Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits fromthe bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but saidthat it came close to one mln stg.    On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pctto 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.    According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due tolower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state. Reuter

The bank official said commercial bank reserves were 22.19billion pesos at the end of December, when reserves requiredwere 21.59 billion.    She said the surplus of 597 mln pesos, compared with adeficit of 390 mln pesos a month earlier and a deficit of 1.64billion at the end of 1985, reflected political uncertainty inthe last quarter of 1986.    Reserve money, the total available to monetary authorities,was a provisional 52.58 billion pesos at the end of 1986. Thiswas 5.19 pct up from 49.98 billion at the end of November and41.85 pct up from 37.09 billion in December 1985.

Britoil Plc 1986 pre-tax profit 134 mln stg vs  FAIRFAX SAYS HIGHER TAX HITS FIRST HALF EARNINGS Media group John Fairfax Ltd <FFXA.S>said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected theimpact of changes in the Australian tax system.    Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mlna year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30mln from 44.29 mln.    Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase incompany tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax onfringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, thecompany said in a statement.    Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenuegrowth in the television industry as another reason for theflat first half earnings.    It said it considered the result satisfactory in view ofthese factors.    Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney MorningHerald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, asdid the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremelysatisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.    But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0pct rise in revenue, it said.    Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to netearnings because group borrowings were reduced following thereceipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from <AustralianAssociated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's "B"shares in Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L>.    This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.    Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for thefull year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlracquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbournewill hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens inSydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.

SWISSAIR REPORTS LOWER PROFIT AND DIVIDEND Swissair <SWSZ.Z> reported a 5.8 pctdrop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that,in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cutits payout to 33 francs per share from 38.    President Robert Staubli told a news conference that thefirst two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit wouldat least equal last year's figure, but said much depended onoutside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.    The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss onSwissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of27 mln francs the previous year, he said.    The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francsin 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended onthe speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.    Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.    Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mlnfrancs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45mln francs supplementary depreciation.    Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions madethis time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange ratefluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.    While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop inthe dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuelprices, there was no such offset for the strength of the francagainst other European currencies.    "Income and profit generated by services to these countriesshrank by a very substantial margin," he said. "Exchange ratetrends therefore hit us much more severely than most otherairlines." Reuter

Production dropped five pct to 25,876 cars from 27,381.Manufacture of the 911 and 928 models rose six pct to 11,122from 10,533 units but production of 924 and 944 models was cutby 12 pct to 14,754 units from 16,848 and would be cut further,the report said.    Car sales fell four pct to 25.269 units from 26,414 in thecomparable half year, the report said. U.S. Demand continuedfor all models but demand fell in other markets.

He told a news conference that business during the year hadweakened somewhat but was still generally positive.    Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26billion marks, 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period.However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximatelyunchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks whencurrent orders from major projects are booked.    Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end-February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billionfor the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pctincrease in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks.    Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at8.64 billion marks.    Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pctyield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profitstotalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against theprevious year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks.    Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks.

PILLSBURY <PSY> HURT BY RESTAURANT OPERATIONS Pillsbury Corp, reporting lowerearnings for the third quarter ended February 28, said a strongperformance by its Foods Group was offset by Restaurants Groupdeclines.    Excluding unusual items, it said restaurants operatingprofit was down in the quarter 12 pct from a year ago as salesrose four pct.    It said Burger King USA and Bennigan's reported higheroperating profit, but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale,which introduced a new menu.    Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron, BurgerKing's distribution arm, and said increased investment spendingon developing concepts - QuikWok, Bay Street and Key West Grill- hurt results.    It said Foods operating profit, excluding unusual items,rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breadsand baking products major contributors to improvement in thequarter.    A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor inprofit improvement for the nine months, Pillsbury said.    Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlrprofit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on thesale of a joint interest in an Australian food company andlower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an earlyretirement program initiated a year ago.    Earlier, Pillsbury reported fourth quarter earnings of 48.5mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, down from 55.4 mln dlrs, or 63 ctsa share a year ago. Sales advanced to 1.53 billion dlrs from1.46 billion dlrs.    Pillsbury said loss of investment tax credits under the1986 Federal Tax Reform Act reduced per-share earnings by ninects in the quarter and 19 cts in the nine months.    As a result of the act, it said its effective income taxrate rose eight points to 48.1 pct in the quarter and 5.5percentage points to 49.7 pct for the nine months. Reuter

BRITOIL SEES LOWER U.K. EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE Britoil Plc's <BTOL.L> explorationexpenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about athird of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure wouldremain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walkersaid.    He told reporters following the release of the company's1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986levels.    U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in1985.    Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinarycharge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The resultswere slightly better than analysts forecast and the sharefirmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman SirPhilip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986had made the period extremely difficult but the company hadcome through remarkably well.    Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, theconditions would be right for a substantially improvedperformance this year.    He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, whenthey were normally weaker, made him "a bit encouraged" about theprospects for future levels.    Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the pricestayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.    Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcementof a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by thelatter part of April.    End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil comparedwith 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that thisincluded a revised definition of reserves.    If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, thereserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrelspreviously.    Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from arestated 3,660 billion.

TEXAS COMMERCE <TCB> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987 Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said thatrelatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger withChemical New York Corp <CHL> would help 1987 earnings increasefrom last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs.    Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview withReuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expectedearnings to increase.    "We would anticipate that this year would be an improvementover last because we are stronger," Love said, referring toTexas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical.The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, willlower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15basis points, Love said.    The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisitionby a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approvedinterstate banking effective January 1.    Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas'struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to reportprofits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank whichearned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc <ALBN> lost 17.6mln dlrs, MCorp <M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation <FBT>, which is activelyseeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mlndlrs.    Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on itsenergy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank'snonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987.    "I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us," hesaid. "The fact that the real estate market is still movingaway suggests there could be some continuing growth ofnonperforming loans."    In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan lossesrelated to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energyloan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of thebank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43pct.    More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans,which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mlndlrs the year before, were in real estate.    Love said he believed the real estate loan problems forTexas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by thethird or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty officebuildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to fouryears, he said.    "I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oilat 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs abarrel," he said.    Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separatesubsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand itsholdings throughout Texas, offering additional products tobuild up its consumer banking business, Love said. "We areresuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,"he said.    In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank inMontgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area,and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. TexasCommerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in theDallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 memberbanks, he said.    One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announcedin December, InterFirst Corp <IFC> and RepublicBank Corp <RPT>,both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valuedat 570 mln dlrs.    The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank andInterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallasbanking market, has not changed Texas Commerce's expansionplans for the state's second-largest city, Love said. "We thinkwe can try to get a little part of their roost," he said.    The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce anedge in developing new consumer products, he said.    "We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more thanone million customers all over the state. Chemical will show ushow to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products," hesaid, referring to expansion of such existing products ascredit cards and investment banking. Reuter

QUEBEC CAISSE EARNS THREE BILLION DLRS IN 1986 Caisse de depot et placement duQuebec, the government agency which manages the province'spension funds, said its investment portfolio earned a netprofit of almost three billion Canadian dlrs in 1986, anincrease of 300 mln dlrs over 1985.    The agency said in its annual statement that it had assetswith a total book value of 25 billion dlrs, or a market valueof 28 billion dlrs, at the end of 1986.    These holdings had a rate of return of 13.5 pct in theyear, which was below the Caisse's average return of 16 pct inthe past four years and 14.2 pct in the past eight years.    The Caisse said foreign equity investments represented 3.6pct of total assets, while U.S. government securities accountedfor another 5.2 pct of the overall portfolio.    The agency's holding of U.S. government securities yieldeda return of 20.7 pct for the year, significantly more thaneither the 14.1 pct earned on the total bond portfolio or the13.5 pct for all funds under management.    "These high liquidity securities, which are held on atemporary basis and for purposes of strategy and the protectionof the overall bond portfolio, have been efficient," the agencysaid of the U.S. securities.    The agency said it has 7.9 billion dlrs invested inCanadian private sector businesses after channeling 965 mlndlrs of new funds into this area in 1986.

The company said 1987 got off on a much better footing thanfiscal 1986, from which the company recorded a loss of 67.6 mlndlrs, or 6.28 dlrs per share, on revenues of 641.4 mln dlrs.    James Sherwood, president of the company, said he expectsto record a loss of approximately 12 mln dlrs for the firstquarter, compared to losses of approximately 22 mln dlrs forfirst quarter fiscal 1986.    The company emphasized the first quarter is a traditionallyslow period for the ferry industry, which is  part of SeaContainers' business.    Sherwoood said the company's losses were largelyattributable to non-recurring events and provisions. He citedthe default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers,costing the company approximately 25 mln dlrs.    He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closingtwo of its subsidiary's ferry services, and a 10.3 mln dlrprovision to cover losses on the sale of container assets andseverance pay costs.

FIRST INTERSTATE <I> ESTIMATES BRAZIL RISKS First Interstate Bancorp said its1987 pre-tax income could be reduced by about 33.5 mln dlrs ifit decides to reclassify its 339 mln dlrs in medium- tolong-term loans to Brazil as nonperforming.    But the company stressed in a filing with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission that it believes it is too soon toreclassify the debt, despite Brazil's Feb 20 suspension ofdirect interest payments on medium- and long-term loans.    "The corporation believes that it is premature to make adecsion to classify such medium- and long-term debt asnonperforming at this time," First Interstate said.    But First Interstate said that if Brazil's suspension ofinterest payments continues, it may have to reclassify itsloans as nonperforming and place them on non-accrual, meaningthat interest previously accrued but not paid would be deductedfrom net income and interest would no longer be accrued.    Besides its medium- and long-term debt, First Interstatesaid it also has 165 mln dlrs in short-term loans or tradelines in Brazil.    As of Dec 31, 1986, nonperforming Brazilian outstandingswere about 4.1 mln dlrs, it said. Reuter

MCDONALD'S <MCD> UP ON REAFFIRMED RECOMMENDATION The stock of McDonald's Corp rosesharply this morning after analyst Daniel Lee of Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc reiterated his recommendation of the stock, traderssaid.    McDonald's, an operator of fast food restaurants, rose1-5/8 to 77-3/8.    "Comparable store sales are up 5.6 pct in 1986 vs 1985,"Lee said, "and the stock is trading below the market multiple."He said "not many companies have a consistent 15 pct annualearnings growth rate, return on equity above 20 pct, but tradeat less than the market multiple."    Analyst Lee said "the introduction of a new line of saladsthis spring, at about the time we are all trying to squeezeinto bathing suits, should boost sales."    He also noted that "the average McDonald's does about 1.369mln dlrs in revenues a year. That compares with 1.1 mln dlrs ayear for the average Burger King and 800,000 dlrs a year forthe average Wendy's." Since it cost about the same to build asingle store for any one of these chains, he said, "McDonald'scan well justify their expansion."    Lee expects McDonald's to earn 4.40 dlrs a share in 1986and 5.15 dlrs in 1988. Last year it earned 3.72 dlrs a share. Reuter

TALKING POINT/FIRST CITY BANCORPORATION <FBT> First City Bancorporation's sale of 54mln dlrs in oil loans to Prudential-Bache should significantlyreduce its energy problems, but the bank's losses are stillvirtually guaranteed to continue, analysts said.    The package of energy loans was sold at book value, soFirst City did not to show a gain or loss, said bank spokesmanJames Day. He added it was possible First City would sell moreof the bank's remaining 1.4 billion dlrs in oil-related loansto raise cash.    The loans had been made by First City to oil producers andto oilfield service and supply companies. Day said some hadalready been classified as nonperforming, or charged off as aloss, but he could not identify how many were included in thosecategories.    The loans were purchased by Prudential Bache's EnergyGrowth Fund, a limited partnership created last month with 90mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties.    First City, the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturnin oil prices, lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some othercapital assistance. The Houston-based bank's nonperformingassets totaled 897.1 mln dlrs at yearend, up from 563.1 mlndlrs at the end of 1985    Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested inthe troubled bank unless government assistance is available.    "Their problems are not just limited to energy. They have asubstantial portfolio in real estate. This sale in and ofitself won't make the company look better to a potentialbuyer," said Ray Archibold, a banking analyst with McCarthy,Crisanti and Maffei Inc.    "It does reduce the bank's exposure in energy loans and 54mln dlrs is a substantial amount," Archibold said, "but thedeal represents only about four pct of their energy loans."    Of First City's total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs, about14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers orsuppliers, analysts said. Its record losses have been caused byits past status as one of the nation's top lenders to oil andgas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late1970s and early 1980s.    First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudentialcame from its Energy Finance Co., an entity formed in 1982 toloan money to "more venturesome" oil borrowers that promised ahigher potential return. The other half of the loans were fromFirst City's lead bank in Houston.    Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co., saidthe sale of the package of energy loans was the firstencouraging news from First City in months.    "It's not going to solve all of First City's problems butit's a good transaction for them. It may be possible for themto sell additional loans," Kotowski said. "Prudential can fundthese things more cheaply than First City and there's anincentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now asvalues are depressed"    In a statement, First City chairman J.A. Elkins said thebank's strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans tototal loans. "This move, which we believe is the firsttransaction of its kind, helps us further, and we were able tomake it without suffering a loss." Reuter

PAN AM CORP 4TH QTR LOSS 197.5 MLN DLRS VS PROFIT 241.4  Morgan Guaranty Ltd's novel and complexrepackaging of Westpac Banking Corp's perpetual floating ratenote (FRN) may attract some investors, but is unlikely to aidcurrent holders of the Westpac securities or the FRN market,FRN traders said.    "It actually does nothing for anyone who has been stuffedand right now, that's the problem," said a trader at one U.K.Clearing bank that has also issued its own perpetuals.    Trading in perpetual issues, which pay interest but nevermature, has come to a virtual halt. Prices have fallen so farthat only about five firms still make markets in them.    The Westpac perpetual notes are technically now theproperty of a newly formed single-purpose finance subsidiary,Pacific Securities. If Morgan tried to find a home for theactual Westpac notes, as is, they would be paid no more than 85cents on the dollar, at most, traders said.    But the repackaging allows them to target a new class ofinvestor for the notes and take the old issues off their bookswithout registering a loss, the traders said.    "The only one the repackaging favours is Morgan," a tradersaid.    Meanwhile, the end-holders of perpetual notes, most of whomare Japanese banks, must still find a way to value them byyear-end, now a week away.    From Morgan's point of view, the repackaging does aid thepresent holders of the notes as well as offering value to a newclass of investors.    "At least we've put a floor under the price of the notes.We've created a way to set a real value for them," one Morganofficial said. Morgan had earlier attempted, but abandoned,another plan to repackage the Westpac securities.    Morgan's holdings of Westpac paper create special problemsfor it because of the way U.S. Regulators view bank holdings ofthe primary capital of other banks, traders said. Therefore, itis crucial that a vehicle for selling the paper be found.    And indeed, note traders said, the FRN portion of therepackaged securities -- which Westpac has offered to redeemfor cash in 15 years -- does have real value.    For one thing, traders noted, it pays about the highestrate over the London Interbank Offered Rate of virtually anynewly issued security. The spread is 50 basis points.    However, the other portion of the security, in which theinvestor pays 20 cents on the dollar for a zero coupon 15-yearbond, is of dubious value unless the Westpac perpetual assumesa market value near par 15 years from now, traders said.    The zero-coupon portion could provide value for an accountwhich for tax purposes, wants to take a large capital loss, thetraders said. In the 15-year period between the time the noteis purchased and the time it is redeemed, no interest is paid.    When repayment finally occurs, it is not in cash like anordinary zero-coupon bond. Instead, the investor receives oneof the Westpac perpetual floaters. REUTER

ATT <T> CHAIRMAN SAYS DIVIDEND WILL NOT BE CUT American Telephone and Telegraph Co doesnot plan to reduce its regular quarterly dividend of 30 cts ashare on its common stock, said James E. Olson, chairman.    "It has been the intent to set the dividend at a level sothat it could be sustained through the ups and downs of thebusiness cycle," Olson told a meeting of securities analysts.    "We see no reason to change that policy," he said.    Although ATT will maintain its current dividend, Olson saidthe company wants to decrease the percentage of earnings paidin dividends by increasing earnings.    Industry analysts had speculated that ATT might cut itscommon dividend, especially after the company posted a fourthquarter net loss of 1.17 billion dlrs and earned only five ctsa share for the full year.    The loss included a one-time restructuring charge of 1.7billion dlrs.    Olson said he expects ATT's cash flow to remain strongdespite the poor earnings. Reuter
ECHLIN INC 2ND QTR SHR 24 CTS V <Allied-Lyons PLC> sees rising profitsfrom 51-pct-owned liquor producer Hiram Walker-Gooderham andWorts in the current fiscal year ending in early March, 1988,chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in a speech prepared fordelivery to Toronto analysts.    "We anticipate that Hiram Walker profits will be well abovethose of the plateau years," he said, referring to the fouryears up to 1985.    "In other words, we will have regained the 1985 positionand improved on it," Holden-Brown said.    Allied-Lyons won control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham lastyear in a battle against Gulf Canada Corp, which finally got a49 pct stake after an out-of-court settlement.    Hiram Walker Resources Ltd, the previous owner, reportedliquor profits of 282 mln Canadian dlrs in the fiscal yearending Sept. 30, 1985, 278 mln dlrs in 1984, 267 mln in 1983,294 mln in 1982 and 280 mln in 1981.    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' financial results for thefiscal year just ended March seven would include three monthsof Hiram Walker-Gooderham profits, but he did not provideactual figures.    He said Hiram Walker-Gooderham's profit improvement in thecurrent year will come from a previously announcedreorganization put into effect March 1, 1987 and a closepartnership with Allied-Lyons' existing Allied Vintnersdivision.

AMERICAN CAN <AC> SEES HIGHER YEAR NET American Can Co chairman Gerald Tsaisaid the company will record higher earnings in the firstquarter and for the full year.    Addressing analysts, Tsai said "First quarter results havebeen extremely encouraging and results for all of 1987 willshow significant improvement over 1986."    American Can earned 196.3 mln dlrs, or 3.21 dlrs per share,adjusted for a two-for-one stock split, in 1986.    In the 1986 first quarter, the company reported net incomeof 67.5 mln dlrs, including one-time gains from sale of assets,or 2.30 dlrs per share, before the stock adjustment.    In the 1987 first quarter, American Can will record aone-time gain of 28 cts per share from the sale of shares inits Musicland Group subsidiary. The gain is slightly higherthan the expected gain the company predicted in Februarybecause additional shares of the unit were sold.    In response to a question, Tsai said American Can'sinvestment in Jefferies and Co is "very small".    "We treat it as just another passive investment," he said.According to press reports, American Can owns 20 pct ofJefferies and is its largest single shareholder.    Yesterday, Boyd Jefferies, chairman and founder of thebrokerage firm bearing his name, resigned from the firm andsaid he would plead guilty to two felony charges for breakingsecurities laws.

The company said the slower than expected removal of thefuel, which has been primarily due to the water-clarityproblems, is now expected to extend fuel removal into 1988.    A spokesman said the company had previously expected thisto be completed by the end of 1987 and has not estimated howfar into 1988 the process will extend. It still expects tocomplete the entire clean-up by the end of 1988, he added.    GPU said its auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, again qualifiedits opinion of GPU's financial statements, adding the recoveryof TMI-2 decommissioning costs to the unresolved issues leadingto the qualified opinion.    GPU said its operating subsidiaries will seek to recoverthe costs of decommissioning TMI-2 in future rate proceedings.    As in past years, the qualified opinion continues to listother uncertainties associated with the accident, which damagedTMI-2 -- the recovery of cleanup costs and any payments fordamages that might exceed available insurance proceeds.

He told a meeting of securities analysts that, although thecompany is not yet at point in its cost-cutting drive toimprove profit margins, it is "on the right track."    Olson said ATT's cash flow was "very strong in the firsttwo months of the year, better than budgeted."    While Olson does not know if the company's earnings andrevenues will improve by yearend, he said ATT is "moving in theproper direction."

HUDSON'S BAY WRITEOFF MAINLY DUE TO DOME STAKE <Hudson's Bay Co> said a writeoff of40.4 mln dlrs, or 1.39 dlrs per share, that it took in 1986 wasmainly due to its investment in Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP>.     The company reported an operating profit of 33.0 mln dlrs,or 32 cts per share, for fiscal 1986, compared to an operatingloss of 9,055,000 dlrs, or 1.23 dlrs per share, in the previousyear.     Hudson's Bay holds about four mln shares of Dome's 10 pctseries one cumulative subordinate convertible preferred shares.    Last March, Dome suspended payment of dividends on allpreferred shares until June 1, 1987. The shares give the holderthe right to convert to Dome common shares at 3.33 dlrs pershare.    Dome has the right to force conversion if Dome commonreaches 3.885 dlrs per share. Dome is trading at 1.12 dlrs pershare, down one ct, today on the Toronto Stock Exchange.    Hudson's Bay also said it had an increase in 1986 in retailoperating profit to 185.3 mln dlrs from 111.4 mln dlrs, butthat was partially offset by an increase of 14.9 mln dlrs ininterest costs and 25.3 mln dlrs in taxes.     Hudson's Bay also said its Markborough propertiessubsidiary had an operating profit of 108.6 mln dlrs, up from98.8 mln dlrs the year before.    Profit from non-Markborough real estate was 23.5 mln dlrsin 1986, down from 27.6 mln dlrs a year ago.    Operating profit from natural resources was 4.2 mln dlrs,up 1.2 mln dlrs from the prior year. Pensions costs werereduced by 34.9 mln dlrs due to an accounting change.

ALLIED-LYONS SEES SUBSTANTIAL SECOND HALF GROWTH <Allied-Lyons PLC> will reportsubstantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 endedMarch 7, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in answer toreporters' queries.    "You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyonsin the second half," Holden-Brown said following a presentationto Toronto securities analysts.    Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth inprofit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported inthe first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mlnstg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year.    Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary costof slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costsassociated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for thecompany, Holden-Brown also said.    But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinarygain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pctinterest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said.    "So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. Buthopefully you win them all in the end," Holden-Brown said.    Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to othertake-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: "No, I don't."    "We must never be complacent and we must always be verywatchful, but I think we would be very expensive," he said.    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporateearnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companiesin the food and beverage industry.    "That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians hadcome a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, Ithink," Holden-Brown said.    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' move to acquire HiramWalker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elderstake-over bid for the company was "100 pct a growth action."    "We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, andthat people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was)defensive, but it never was," Holden-Brown told reporters.    Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a shareissue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in HiramWalker, Holden-Brown responded: "Plan might be too strong aword. But I must say I do feel the need for Allied-Lyons to bebetter known in Canada." Reuter
BALLY <BLY> SEEN SELLING OFF HEALTH UNIT Bally Manufacturing Corp's proposedpublic offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit isseen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit,analysts said.    "In the longer-term horizon, Bally wants to concentrate onits gaming businesses," said analyst Dennis Forst of SeidlerAmdec Securities Inc.    Last week, Bally said it was considering the sale ofanother non-casino unit, its Six Flags amusement park unit,which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs.    Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said "the company currentlyhas no hard plans to the sell any more of the health clubcompany, but in the long term we'll wait and see how theoffering goes."    Once Bally's biggest revenue producer, the health club unithad 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2mln dlrs, 28 pct of Bally's revenues. Analysts estimate theunit could be sold for for 300-500 mln dlrs.    Analysts said Bally's decision to offer shares in the unitcould be the first step to selling it.    "It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease thehealth club unit's debt, increase its cash flow and operatingincome, making it an attractive buy to a third party," StevenEisenberg of Bear Stearns said.    On Monday, Bally said it filed with the Securities andExchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct, or 5.8mln shares, of the unit's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share.   About half the proceeds, 40 mln dlrs, will be used to reduceparent Bally Manufacturing's debt which has swelled to 1.6billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchaseof shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostiletakeover, according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson.    Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from aseparate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertiblesubordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs ofshort term senior bank debt of the health chain unit, a Ballyspokesperson said.    Analysts said Bally's health club unit's profits haveremained strong, but are skeptical about the industry's longrange prospects.    "The fitness club industry, over the last 10 years, hasgrown tremendously, but the question is whether its a fad or apermanent part of our lifestyle," said Eisenberg of BearStearns.    Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if thepublic stays at its peak of health consciousness, but thatovercapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes.     In addition, "the returns in the fitness club industry arejust not as high as they are in the gaming industry," said oneanalyst.     There are about 6,500 fitness clubs in the U.S., excludingclubs run by not-for-profit organizations, according to theAssociation of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to bean 8.0-billion-dlr-a-year industry.     Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit, which is thenation's largest health club chain, Peltier said, "no one hasthe money to offer to buy it."    "The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with noleader and there is a great opportunity for growth throughacquisition and then standardization," said Wayne LaChapelle,chief financial officer of Livingwell INc <WELL>, the nation'ssecond largest fitness chain operator whih    LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested inacquisition opportunities but "could not afford an acquisitionthe size of Bally at this time."

RAFIDAIN BANK'S JORDAN BRANCH RAISES CAPITAL The Jordan branch of Iraq's Rafidain Banksaid it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country'sminimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profitsfrom its operations in the country.    Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to complywith the new capital requirement -- raised from three mlndinars -- by the start of 1986.    Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi toldReuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higherlevel but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. Thebank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars.    Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the highercapital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decidedinstead to close its operation, banking sources said.    Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, whilethe branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash.    Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made anexception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply.They said the gesture refelcted close political ties betweenJordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties.    The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars. REUTER
WOOLWORTHS LTD REPORTS 9.27 MLN DLR NET PROFIT YR END FEB 1 VS 6 Brazil wants to resume interest paymentson its medium- and long-term foreign debt as soon as possibleand is willing to discuss ways of softening the impact of thepayments suspension on bank earnings, central bank governorFrancisco Gros said.    Gros, speaking to reporters yesterday after his firstmeeting with Brazil's bank advisory committee since he wasappointed last month, also promised a clear statement ofBrazil's economic policy would be made in the next few days.    But bankers who attended the meeting with Gros said it wasinconclusive.    The bankers also expressed disappointment Gros could notgive assurances as to when interest payments on the 68 billiondlrs of medium- and long-term debt would restart.    "It was all very tentative. You can't expect to get very farat the first meeting," one banker said.    The meeting took place on the eve of the annual meetinghere of the Inter-American Development Bank.    The most urgent item on yesterday's agenda was the need fora legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbankcredit lines extended to Brazilian banks which expire at theend of March.    Brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enoughcredit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needsto request a formal extension of the commitments to head offpossible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.    The issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee willendorse Brazil's request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide orsimply relay it without comment.    This delicate question was not resolved at yesterday'smeeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitablelanguage for a telex by midweek, Gros and the bankers said.    Gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-dayrollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originallymatured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on April 15.Bankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money issubject to the moratorium.    Once interest on Brazil's debts becomes more than 90 daysoverdue, U.S. And Canadian banks must put the loans onnon-performing basis and may book payments only as and whenthey are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.    Citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarterwould be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put Brazil on a cash basis.Other U.S. Banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.    Gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible andsaid he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see ifthere was a way round the problem.    He did not elaborate. But, asked whether a bridge loanmight be arranged to pay the interest, he said, "It couldhappen."    Bankers said this possibility had not been raised at thecommittee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent withBrazil's determination to find a long-term solution to theproblem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.    Gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at atime is not very useful. Only if Brazil has access to new loanscan it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.    "If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can'tmeet all its obligations," he said.    Gros defended Brazil's recent economic record, notinginflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and thepublic sector budget was in operational surplus.    But he said there was a need to spell out governmentpolicy, especially on prices.    "It's necessary to clarify policy for internal and externalreasons," he said, but declined to say what economic measuresmight be introduced.    Once policy is in place, Gros said financing talks with thebanks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoedby the country's creditors. REUTER

AMERICAN MOTORS <AMO> STATEMENT QUALIFIED American Motors Corp said its auditorsqualified the company's 1986 financial report.    The report was qualified due to uncertainties surroundingthe previously announced arbitration award against AmericanMotors' former subsidiary, AM General Corp. The award is beingcontested.    The report was filed today with the Securities and ExchangeCommission along with a copy of Chrysler Corp's <C> proposal totake over American Motors.    American Motors said earlier than an arbitration award,made to Emerson Electric Co <EMR> in February, amounted to 60mln dlrs plus legal expenses. American Motors has challengedthe award.    The automaker sold the AM General unit to LTV Corp <QLTV>in 1983, the same year it was awarded a five-year, 1.2 billiondlr procurement contract with the military. LTV and AM Generallast year sought protection under Chapter 11.    The arbitration proceeding was called after EmersonElectric charged AM General violated an agreement covering thedevelopment of certain components in the contract.    The components were for the military's "High MobilityMulti-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle" (HMMWV), American Motors said.    In selling AM General to LTV, American Motors agreed toindemnify LTV against losses incurred by LTV resulting from theEmerson Electric claims.    AMC also said the award has not been confirmed by a court,and faces additional legal challenges. It said that, because ofthe LTV and Am General reorganizations, the final amount of aconfirmed award and the amount of any loss to LTV is uncertain. Reuter

TONKA <TKA> SEES LOWER FISCAL FIRST QUARTER NET Tonka Corp said it expectsresults for its fiscal first quarter to end April four, todecline from the record earnings of 3.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts ashare and revenues of 53.2 mln dlrs.    The toy manufacturer attributed its anticipated lowerfinancial results to an an expected moderate decline inshipments of its Pound Puppies product line.    Tonka also said it expects revenues and earnings to remainlower through the 1987 first half compared with 1986 recordresults of 125.4 mln dlrs in revenues and 10.3 mln dlrs in netearnings or 1.47 dlrs a share.    The company said its level of shipments is good despite aconservative buying pattern on the part of retailers industrywide. Tonka's first quarter shipments will be down somewhatfrom 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be downslightly from a year ago, it said.    Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on areturn to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in whichretailers order and stock conservatively early in the year andtime large shipments for the second half, it said.    Tonka said that while the pace of order writing is trailinglast year's, bookings are "very good" for orders on several ofits new product introductions for 1987. Reuter

BAYERNVEREIN EXPECTS UNCHANGED DIVIDEND FOR 1987 Bayerische Vereinsbank AG <BVMG.F>expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's recordlevels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said.    He told the annual news conference that possible creditrisks, especially those associated with foreign nations, hadlargely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were thereforeunlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.    Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profitincreased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.    Hackl said that interest margins in the banking businesshad declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previousyear. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increasedslightly and stood around 0.7 pct.    Parent bank commission surplus in the securities businesshad risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.    Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mlnmarks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.    The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, whichexcludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbedtwo pct to 671 mln marks.    The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.    It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgagebusiness and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.    The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank businessvolume rose to 46 pct from 45.    Hackl said that in January and February this year, thebank's credit business had not livened up. But despite thesharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on ownaccount had increased in the first two 1987 months comparedwith the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

SOCIETE GENERALE REPORTS HIGHER 1986 PROFITS France's Societe Generale <SGEN.PA> bank,which will be sold to the private sector in the second half ofthis year, reported increased profits for last year.    Societe Generale, one of the three largest state-ownedbanking groups, said in a statement that its parent companyprofit for 1986 totalled 800 mln francs, up 21.2 pct on 1985's660 mln profit.

The bank's parent company gross operating profits were up5.4 pct at 21.34 billion francs against 20.24 billion in 1985.    The increase in the bank's gross operating profits wasmostly due to a rise in french franc deposits and personalloans as well as the development of its financial activities,Societe Generale said.

IBM <IBM> REBOUND SEEN BY BERNSTEIN ANALYST International Business Machines Corp,hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back bythe end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst RickMartin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said.    "There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit notuntil later this year," Martin said at a technology conferencesponsored by the investment firm.    Martin said the coming rebound reflects new productintroductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drasticimprovement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.    IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs inmid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at149-1/2 dlrs.    Analysts, computer industry executives, and the companyitself, have highlighted the external economic factorshampering IBM's growth.    But Martin said the product cycle was key to understandingthe rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, andpointed to Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> to support his view."By replacing the product line, earnings have soared," he saidof DEC's line of VAX computers.    In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatiblemid-range product line. A new computer code-named "Fort Knox"was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-rangesystems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.    Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into theIBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects shouldbe unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. "The major story will be arebound in its mid-range business."    He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growthin mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.    High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are comingto the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth willdrop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.    By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martinsaid. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of51.3 billion dlrs.    Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earningsand stock have been propelled by a strong slew of productintroductions in the mid-range area.    In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat toDEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies werecatering largely to existing customer bases, rather thanstealing market share from one another.

BRUNSWICK <BC> SEES HIGHER 1987 FIRST QUARTER Brunswick Corp expects 1987 firstquarter sales to be up "dramatically" and profits to "do well,"chairman and president Jack Reichert said after a securitiesanalysts meeting.    He declined to be more specific.    In the 1986 first quarter, Brunswick reported earnings of23.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a share on sales of 396.7 mln dlrs.    Reichart noted that results of its two newly-acquired boatmanufacturing companies will be included in the company's firstquarter report.    Brunswick expects its recreation centers to benefit fromincreased attention to the sport of bowling resulting fromacceptance in the 1988 Summer Olympics of bowling as anexhibition sport and as a medal sport in the 1991 Pan AmericanGames, he said.    He said field testing of a new bowling concept involvingelectronic features is being readied for test marketing thissummer, and if successful, could "materially benefit"operations.    Brunswick is currently test marketing in California ahealth club facility adjoining a bowling center, he said.

The spokesman said the transaction was accounted for as anacquisition, but the Securities and Exchange Commission tookissue with the accounting method and said it should beaccounted for as a reorganization of entities under commoncontrol.    This treatment requires that the costs associated with thetransaction be expanded rather than capitalized as anintangible asset, the company said.

AMERICAN EXPRESS DECLARED A TWO-FOR-ONE STOC U.S. Agriculture undersecretary DanAmstutz indicated the United States is willing talk with theSoviet Union about the competitiveness of U.S. wheat prices butwould not discuss making U.S. wheat prices "cheap."    "There sometimes is a difference between being competitiveand being cheap," Amstutz told a Senate AgricultureAppropriations hearing.    Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow andWashington last summer on the level of the U.S. subsidy offeredon wheat to the Soviet Union, was over whether the U.S. wheatprice was competitive or cheap.    "I think there is a (U.S.) willingness to explore thisissue as it pertains to competitiveness," Amstutz said.    However, Amstutz added that the United States would not bewilling to discuss wheat prices with Moscow "if the issue isbeing cheap."    Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinctionbetween competitive and cheap, Amstutz would not elaborate.    Amstutz said it is the U.S. judgment that the long-termgrain agreement between the two countries calls for Moscow tobuy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at"prices in effect in this country."    Amstutz made the comments in response to a question fromSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, about expanding the exportenhancement program to include grain sales to the Soviet Union. Reuter

SPRINT OPTIMISTIC DESPITE LOSSES US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone ventureof GTE Corp <GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc <UT> set uplast June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net lossof about 500 mln dlrs this year.     David M. Holland, president of US Sprint's Dallas-basedSouthwest Division, told Reuters in an interview that he didnot know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreedthat for the year the company should have about the sameresults as last year when it lost "about 500 mln dlrs."     He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrsover "two plus years" to set up its network.    Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mlndlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in orderto lease its lines.     He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optictelephone line are now "in the ground," and 7,000 miles areoperable.     By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company'ssubscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (insteadof leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of thesecond quarter.    Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses alongmicroscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and moreeconomical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic linethe diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of informationas a copper cable 20 feet in diameter.     "By the end of the year, we will have the capacity tocarry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls," Hollandsaid.    He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S.long distance market, with MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> about10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct.     Holland said Sprint's rates, which were 50 pct lower thanATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephoneexchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all thecompanies have equal access. He said the company was cuttingback its advertising by about 30 pct this year.     At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its totalnumber of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 tolast January.    "We've captured the fiber high ground, shown the importanceof it," he said.     Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said hebelieved ATT "should be given some flexibility, but should beregulated on pricing plans."     "They're so dominant in the market place," he said, addingthat ATT should be deregulated when "there is true competitionin the marketplace."     "It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money," hesaid, adding, "maybe two to four years out, it's hard to say."    Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint'stwo owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, suchas the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure onthem to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings.     "They are two excellent partners who have stated time andtime again their support of US Sprint," he said, adding that hewas "amazed" at industry talk that the two companies might bearguing. "There's no evidence of that," he said.     He said Sprint's progress in such areas as revenues,number of customers and construction was on track, even "aheadin many areas."    Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprintcurrently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988.    "We want to be in every country that ATT serves," he said.    He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico butwas working on it.     He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, theforerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation's telephonenetwork. Reuter

SWIRE SEEN REPORTING 20 PCT RISE IN 1986 PROFIT Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HKG> islikely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operatingprofits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains inits aviation and property businesses, share analysts said.    Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits fromoperations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrscompared with 1.23 billion in 1985.    They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain ofabout 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its CathayPacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG> unit last May.    Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.    Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividendfor its "A" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 centsadjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.    Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of thecompany's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits,analysts said.    The company's aviation division consists of its majoritystake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in<Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pctowned by Cathay.    Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuelcosts and greater traffic.    Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before theflotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and hassince slipped to 50.23 pct.    Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profitsrose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.    Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd,estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.    "Much depends on properties," said Measor. "And they did a lotbetter in the second half of the year."    Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned SwireProperties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mlncompared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.    Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrsfor the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for thesame 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to thelow level of completion of new residential flats. The firm'sproperties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residentialdevelopment and two luxury housing projects.    Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats inTaikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs insecond-half 1986.    During the year property prices continued to rise as morepeople bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates,analysts said.    "At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were sellingat 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a yearago," said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.)Ltd.    Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex inthe central business district of Hong Kong but it will notprovide income until the first stage is completed next year.    The company also sold three properties and a part interestin a proposed hotel development, which should result inextraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to JamesCapel (Far East) Ltd.    Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expectedto earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping andoffshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.

SHELL AUSTRALIA REPORTS 45.79 MLN DLR 1986 PROFIT Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AMS> unit<Shell Australia Ltd>, said its net profit fell to 45.79 mlndlrs in 1986 from 66.76 mln in 1985.    Revenue fell to 4.55 billion dlrs from 4.91 billion, in anextremely competitive and over-regulated environment, chairmanand chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement. A 26.25mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after avery disappointing year.    "A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a verymeagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation ofaround 10 pct," he said.    Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance ondownstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns andthe financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project.    Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrsagainst 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government tomove quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation.    "It is just as important for Australia to maintain afinancially healthy, technically advanced refining andmarketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration andproduction," he said.    "The Australian oil industry has the experience and thecapacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if thegovernment would stop putting roadblocks in our way," he said.    Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years toupgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but furtherinvestment required an appropriate rate of return, he said.    Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18.77mln dlrs from 26.35 mln, while investment in property and plantrose to 374.25 mln from 353.94 mln a year earlier.

Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.    Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating inthe market for several months, dealers said. Initially itcentred on <Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, thenswitched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.    Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks withNorcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros whichreplied that any benefits that could be achieved could alsoresult from normal trading.    In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a risein pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnoverthat lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln    Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had amarket capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series ofacquisitions in the next four years has pushed itscapitalisation up to around 380 mln.    The convertible offer would be on the basis of fourWilliams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p ashare. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of400.2p a share.    The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share pricedown to 733p from last night's close at 750p.    Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.    There was no immediate response from Norcros. REUTER

SANTOS SAYS PROFITS HIT BY OIL PRICE FALL Leading Australian onshore oil and gasproducer, Santos Ltd <STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hitby sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate andliquefied petroleum gas (LPG).    The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in netprofit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.    Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statementthat increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, alongwith reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oilexploration and development outlays, were helping Santos dealwith an adverse business climate.    Santos said it remained financially strong with aninjection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at theend of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.    It said it had also made significant progress in repayingdebts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' fundshad fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.    Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bidfor the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gascompany <TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mlndlrs.    Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollardenominated and significant currency purchases were made duringthe year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.    Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program,finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oilexploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added toreserves -- less than depletion during the year.    Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year schemeto double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget foroil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.    Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices andproduction volumes but with extra oil exploration andencouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.    But it called on the goverment to continue fosteringdomestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.    "It makes no sense to abandon this policy now whenexploration is at its lowest level for many years and whenAustralia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,"Massy-Green said. REUTER

Prudential Corp 1986 pretax profit 178.1 mln stg vs 1 Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlrpurchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Incbrokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurersare likely to follow, securities analysts said.    The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage housesis likely to pay off in dollars and international marketposition, they said. "It's part of a trend towards growingcapital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreignfinancial institutions," said Simon Smithson, an analyst withKleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm describedby some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will giveNippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions onWall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of itsassets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in businesssectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory assetmanagement, market research, and consulting on financing.    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and theworld's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve thedeal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese lifeinsurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japaneseinsurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocksand sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets andinstruments.    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official wasappointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co'sboard and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become alimited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller andproblem-plagued banks in 1984. "But now Japanese are going forblue-chip organisations," he said.    "It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturingindustries," said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. "With ahistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan."    Competition in fund management has grown along with greaterJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mlnyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17to 18 pct, he said.    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas andgain experience with financial instruments which are likely tospread to Japan with further deregulation. "The high regulatoryenvironment has delayed (life insurance firms')diversification. Now there's a growing number of new productsin an environment of increasing competition for performance onfund management," Smithson said. REUTER

WOOLWORTH U.K. SAYS GROWTH PROSPECTS EXCITING Woolworth Holdings Plc <WLUK.L> whichearlier announced a 1986 pre-tax profits rise of 42 pct over1985, said its prospects for growth were very exciting.    The profit figure of 115.3 mln stg exceeded a forecast bysome 10 pct made during the hostile bid by Dixons Group Plc<DXNS.L> last year and the company said the results were amajor step towards the aim of making Woolworth the mostprofitable retailing group in the U.K.    It aimed to produce growth from all its businesses and lookfor opportunities to acquire specialist retail businesses.

The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pctand retail profit by 37 pct, with its pretax contribution of45.5 mln making it the largest single component.    The company said that the improvement had been achieved bysubstantial organic growth in existing stores as well as by theopening of a further 29 new outlets and enhanced margins.    In other sectors, the Comet electrical chain raised retailprofits by 46 pct to 17.4 mln stg, while the Woolworth chainreported a 120 pct improvement to 38.7 mln.    The company said its property operations would increasesubstantially following the start of a joint venture deal withdevelopers <Rosehaugh Plc>.    The defence costs against the 1.9 billion stg bid fromDixons resulted in a 16.0 mln stg extraordinary charge.    The results were 10 mln stg up on most analysts forecasts.As a result, the group's shares rose strongly, peaking at 865pfrom last night's 842p before easing to 860p at 1155 GMT. Reuter

The company said that its 1986 performance was bestreflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mlnfrom 221 mln in 1985.    Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeoverof Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the businessprofile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvodealer.

NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR<NSM> CITES IMPROVED RESULTS National Semiconductor Corpsaid improved results at its Semiconductor Group helped reducelosses in the third quarter and nine months.    In the quarter ended March 8, the group had a modest salesincrease and major improvement in operating performancecompared to the year-ago quarter, the company said.    But results softened from the prior quarter because of lowbookings last fall for third quarter shipment and holidayshutdowns, it said.    The semiconductor maker cut net losses to 25.6 mln dlrs or31 cts a share from 39.4 mln dlrs or 47 cts in the quarter.    Losses in the nine months were reduced to 32.7 mln dlrs or44 cts from 84.4 mln dlrs or one dlr.

LOWER TAX OFFSETS LOWER SHELL U.K. UPSTREAM PROFIT <Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit onexploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil priceslast year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.    But he told a press conference that due to the highmarginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact ofthe drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.    The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, withPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, hesaid.    As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration andproduction sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.    Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/ShellGroup <RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg,up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against8.81 mln.    Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oiloutput from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986,which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for thecompany. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in thecurrent year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the declinein output from the major Brent field, he said.    Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gasliquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected tobe maintained in 1987, he said.    A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and OspreyNorth Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oilprice fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.    Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider NorthSea fields, which were approved last year, have brought thecost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.    Day to day operating costs of the exploration andproduction sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the targetis to keep costs per barrel constant.    The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading tothe discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early togauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.    Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to aprofit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.    Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit <ShellU.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987were a "bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986."    In November and December in particular, refining operationshad shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oilproduct prices, he said. He expected margins to continuegenerally positive over the summer, although they could dip tobecome negative from time to time, depending on pricemovements.    A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery willnow come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about fivemonths behind schedule, following a crane accident whichseverely damaged the plant last year, he said.    Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemicalsite.    Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by whichcompanies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifyingdevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields againstPRT, was "helpful," but rather less than had been hoped for.    Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was inthe range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, hewould expect some over-production above OPEC"s official 15.8 mlnbpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.    He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrainoutput was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil willfall. Reuter

PRUDENTIAL RECORDS BEST RESULTS IN SIX YEARS <Prudential Corporation Plc>, whichearlier announced a 62 pct rise in 1986 pre-tax profits, saidit had recorded its best general insurance result for six yearsbut had not reached satisfactory levels of profit in otherareas.    Group Chief Executive Brian Corby told a news conferencethat despite returning to trading profits, the Internationaldivision and the Mercantile and General division had notreached satisfactory levels.    But he said he welcomed Mercantile and General tradingprofits in 1986 and was optimistic about both that and theInternational division.    The acquisition of the U.S. Life company <Jackson National>had a small effect in 1986 but its full effect would be felt inthe 1987 results, Corby said.    The Group also intended to expand the number of its estateagency firms bought last year, and hoped they will comprisebetween 10 and 15 pct of total company profits in the future.    "We hope they will be very profitable very shortly. We arelooking for profits from the estate agencies themselves as wellas the insurance products associated with them," Corby said.

CRS SIRRINE <DA> TO TAKE WRITE-OFF CRS Sirrine Inc said it plans a majorrestructuring of its balance sheet that will include awrite-off of between 39 mln and 43 mln dlrs, most of whichwould be intangible goodwill from the company's pastacquisitions.    The company said the remainder of its write-off wouldinclude a one-time expense for future costs related to earlyretirement programs, office consolidations and an increase inthe general reserve for adjustments and contingencies.    Bruce Wilkinson, president of the company, said the chargesto the company's third quarter earnings, for the period endingMarch 31, would "significantly impact" third quarter resultsbut would not affect the company's cash position.    "We expect to have the biggest operating backlog in thecompany's history by June 30, 1987, the end of our fiscalyear," Wilkinson said. "We believe the action being proposedwill begin to contribute to improved earnings in the fourthquarter of our fiscal 1987 and throughout fiscal 1988."    The company, which is one of the nation's largestconstruction firms, also said termination of its definedbenefit retirement plan would produce a pre-tax benefit ofabout 10 mln dlrs due to overfunding of the plan.

STANDARD CHARTERED BOOSTED BAD-DEBT PROVISIONS Standard Chartered Plc <STCH.L>, facedwith a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets andan ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted itsbad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.    Barber said in a statement on the bank's 1986 results thatbad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific,stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.    Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively inthe specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Taxbreaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.    In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Totalpre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.    "The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singaporeand Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shippingindustry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad anddoubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, ontop of the normal level of provisioning," Barber said.    He said, "the decision was also taken to build up loan lossreeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges forgeneral provisions for commercial and cross border risks."    Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacificregion made "a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits."    He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesseswas "well maintained, although the reported result was affectedby cross border debt provisioning," while Californian subsidiaryUnion Bank "showed continued growth."    "Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned inexcellent performances and the revival in Europe continued," hesaid.    Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off atakeover bid by Lloyds Bank <LLOY.L> last year, strengthenedits capital resources during that year to just over threebillion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.    Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primarycapital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said. Reuter

KODAK <EK> TO CUT POLYESTER FIBER OPERATIONS Eastman Kodak Co said it willreduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiberoperations of its Eastman Chemicals division.    A company spokesman said the company will take "somewriteoff" in connection with the action in the first quarterand there will probably be a further "carryover" writeoff inthe second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs ofplants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connectedwith the staff cuts.    Kodak said the division will discontinue production ofpolyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at itsCarolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity,mostly in Columbia.    The company said about 350 jobs will be affected inColumbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers,and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant inKingsport, Tenn.    Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achievedthrough an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement planfor employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical ProductsInc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten DefenseCorp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to becompleted by April 30.    Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performancehave led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POYproduction will be shut down as a result of its exit from thebusiness. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastmansince last year.    The company said annual capacity for production of Kodelpolyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from500 mln due to lesser demand.    It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phasein a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.    Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsportunits affected about 10,800.    The company spokesman later said the charges will beinsignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.

PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986 The state oil company Petroeleos deVenezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income fromoil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal byalmost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and MinesArturo Hernandez Grisanti said.    Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annualassembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales haddropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from lastyear's 13.3 billion.    Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34pct which Hernandez said "had a very serious impact onVenezuela."    PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, ofwhich 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refinedproducts.    The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpdand the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was notenough to cover the losses from a drop in the average pricefrom 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.    The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higherthan the figure originally announced by the Central Bank.Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accountingsystem which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refiningand marketing operations.    Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However,Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keepgasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.    Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrelsin reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance ofVenezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country'sproduction capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, ofwhich 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.     Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in theworld, Hernandez said. Reuter

IMPERIAL OIL <IMO.A> TO FOCUS ON HIGHER PROFIT Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by ExxonCorp <XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strengthand improving near-term earnings performance through operatingexpense reductions and selective capital spending, the companysaid in the annual report.    Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs oncapital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985.    Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fellto 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27dlrs share in the prior year.    Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results fromthe desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities shouldthe investment climate improve and the belief that low orvolatile crude oil prices could continue during the nextseveral years.    The company also said actions initiated during 1986 torestructure and improve efficiency should continue to showbenefits in 1987.    During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative andmarketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number ofworkers by 16 pct to 12,500.    Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual reportthat it is too early to determine whether the recent upwardmovement in international oil prices will be sustained.    "It is still a time for prudence and caution, and thecompany's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentalsof market supply and demand," he said.    Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum productsdivision are more promising than before, but are stilluncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mlndlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985.    Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on itspetroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has inthe United States.    The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynessaid. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good aslong as economic growth continues, but future large grainsurpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressureon prices.    Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986,compared to three mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter

But the effect of the deal on 1987 earningscan be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts arecompleted, it said.

The sale is an important part of a restructuring announcedin November, CPC said.    Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurredin the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialtybaking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was part of the restructuring.    As of December 31, CPC had bought about 15 mln of itscommon shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January, for atotal cost of 621.8 mln dlrs, according to its 1986 annualreport.    In December, CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for atotal of about 170 mln dlrs.    CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European cornwet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt,including that incurred under the share buyback.    In total, CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of commonstock, adjusted for the split, it said today. In November itauthorized a buyback of 20 mln shares, adjusted for the split.    The buyback and the restructuring were triggered inNovember, after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman,chairman of Revlon Group Inc <REV>, acquired about 7.6 pct ofCPC's then outstanding stock.    In 1986, the European corn wet milling business had salesof 914.1 mln dlrs, operating income before overheads of 68.8mln dlrs and associated headquarters overhead costs of 19.7 mlndlrs, according to CPC's 1986 annual report.

JARDINE MATHESON PROFITS SEEN UP SHARPLY IN 1986 A strong performance by its retailbusinesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson HoldingsLtd <JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in1986, stock analysts said.    They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings ofbetween 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mlnin 1985.    The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to paya total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents ashare in 1985.    James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the incometo retail sales.    Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and itsfranchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxurygoods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.    Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put JardineMatheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said heestimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.    But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG> will fall toabout 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.    The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from HongKong Land of <Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September.    Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm asa result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will bookrevenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of theyear as part of its retail business, which will increase itsoverall retail income figures.    Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharplyincreased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pctshare of <Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>.    Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.    Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest paymentsof about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mlndlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at aboutthe 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.    But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mlndlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.    Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisationsthat will in effect turn it into a holding company for itsdiverse interests.    It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in bothHong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created <JardineStrategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest.    A company statement issued last month said the firm willuse the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with anadditional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.    Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stakein the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it islikely to develop its own business, analysts said.    "The future of the stock will depend on the firm's abilityto creatively structure some new acquisitions," said Hargreavesof Hoare Govett.    He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a keysector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to itsexisting business. REUTER
CHINA'S FIRST JOINT VENTURE BANK REPORTS PROFIT China's first joint venture bank, XiamenInternational Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank's first full year ofoperation.    General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profitforecast, saying targets were under study.    Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group'soutstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs,up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowingsrose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters.    Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parentcompany rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries <XiamenInternational Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and <LusoInternational Bank Ltd> in Macao.    The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985but did not officially open until March 1986.    Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreignpartner, Hong Kong-listed <Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cutlast year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreignbanks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the threeChinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.    Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin wereunfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported aloss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of268,000 dlrs in 1985.    The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank ofChina, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15,Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) andXiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).    One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced thesame problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete onunequal terms with state-owned banks.    The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almostsaturated, he added.    Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefittedfrom contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But theforeign banker, who asked not to be named, said it facedinternal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.    Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the InternationalAgricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and thestate-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eightforeign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of HongKong or overseas Chinese banks.

Acquisitions were the high-performance connecting materialsoperations of Celanese Corp, Inmont Corp bought from UnitedTechnologies and American Enka bought from AKZO NV <AKZO.AS>.

NIPPON STEEL TO REDUCE DIVIDEND Nippon Steel Corp <NSTC.T> plans toreduce its dividend to three yen in the year ending March 311987 from the five yen of 1985/86, a company spokesman said.    The company estimated parent company current losses at 15billion yen in 1986/87, including a gain of 95 billion yen fromthe sale of securities. This compares with a 36.07 billion yenprofit a year earlier.    Sales in 1986/87 are seen at 2,150 billion yen, down from2,685 billion a year ago.    Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen's riseand slow world steel demand. Nippon is expected to reportparent company results in late May.    Total 1986/87 crude steel production is estimated at 25.57mln tonnes, down from 27.98 mln a year earlier.    Crude steel production is likely to be below 1986/87 outputbut forecasts for profits and sales in the year starting April1 are unavailable yet, he said. REUTER
BAT SEES STRONG PERFORMANCE FROM ALL SECTORS A strong performance from all BATIndustries Plc's <BTI.L> major sectors enabled the group's 1986pretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the thirdyear running, Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement.    The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39billion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help fromexchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.    Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks FifthAvenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper.    Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a fourpct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume.    The results were largely in line with analysts expectationsand BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT.

KLOECKNER UND CO'S 1986 PROFIT FALLS ABOUT 20 PCT Kloeckner &amp; Co KGaA, theinternational trading group, said its 1986 domestic group netprofit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that theprofit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.    The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted adomestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.    It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mlnmark write-back of reserves that had been created to coverpossible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessarybecause of recent declines in raw material prices.    Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall inprices as well as the lower value of the dollar.    It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinaryshare capital, which is entirely in private hands and heldlargely by family foundations.    Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participationcertificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yieldof around 10 pct. Holders of the certificates are entitled to aquarter of the 1986 payment, or around 2.50 marks, the companyadded. REUTER
SWIRE EXPECTS CONTINUED GROWTH THIS YEAR Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HKG> expectscontinued growth in all divisions this year though it seesproblems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said.    He told reporters:"1987 has started well for Cathay PacificAirways which looks forward to another good year... SwireProperties expects further good results both from propertiesunder development for sale and from its investment propertyportfolio."    He did not give any specific projections for earnings. Thecompany earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.    Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrsmainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay PacificAirways Ltd <CAPH.HKG>.    Miles said the company will use the money to develop itsbusiness, primarily in Hong Kong.    Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of theenlarged capital to the state-owned <China International Trustand Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.    Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay'sflights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.    He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of "amarginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled withsavings in fuel costs."    "At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stablefor the rest of this year," he said, "though there might be a bitof increase later this year.''    Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil serviceoperations, even though the marine sector is generallydepressed. "Obviously the marine industry is not getting anybetter," he said.    The real estate market remained strong and Swire last yearrevalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared withan increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.    Miles said he expects the property market to remain firmbut said the firm has no available land for a major housingproject such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kongisland now near completion.    He said the company's 50 pct unit <Hongkong United DockyardLtd> is negotiating with the government for the development ofan existing petroleum storage depot into a major housingestate.

BAT SHARES UNDERVALUED, SAY STOCK MARKET ANALYSTS BAT Industries Plc <BTI.L> 1986 results,which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed thecompany was in a strong position and that its shares wereprobably undervalued, share analysts said.    BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon tradingafter a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538pearlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39billion pre-tax.    Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stockmarket plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BATshares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in theshare price.    "In the current market, people almost expect companies tobeat expectations," said one analyst, adding that pretax profitsof 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.    BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985pretax profit of 1.17 billion.    Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from itsunderperforming industries and the decreasing share of thetobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.    BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that thetobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74pct four years ago.    Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the companydeclining further as other sectors increased in importance.    He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financialservices, in particular in the U.S.    Sheehy also said the group had "no sizeable acquisitions" insight in the near future.    Analysts said BAT's increasingly good performance in theU.K. Insurance area was encouraging.    Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to makemajor acquisitions, they said. Reuter

A presidential spokesman said President Jose Sarney hadauthorised the government's economic team to prepare the newplan as soon as possible.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said last night the planwould reflect "an important battle to protect the country'sdevelopment and keep it from recession."    Funaro, who helped lead the anti-inflation Cruzado Planlaunched in February 1986, has come under increasing attackover the past few days following the resignation of PlanningMinister Joao Sayad on March 17. Observers say the plan hasfailed to stabilise the country's economy.    Sayad submitted a new package calling for a 90-day pricesand a wage freeze, but met opposition from Sarney and Funaro.    Foreign Ministry sources said the new strategy was beingprepared by economists Persio Arida and Andre Lara Resende,both former Central Bank officials said to have played leadingroles in the Cruzado Plan.   The new plan will define the terms on which Brazil will seekrescheduling of its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.    On February 20, Brazil suspended servicing of 70 billiondlrs of debt to private foreign banks.    Funaro said last night Brazil wants a rescheduling programspread over four years, and added that it had to include newloans to keep the domestic economy growing.    "In the past two years Brazil paid 24 billion dlrs inservicing of its foreign debt, while only getting two billiondlrs in new loans," Funaro said.  REUTER

U.S. SHOE INC 4TH QTR SHR 31 CTS V Three men were charged today withoperating a large tax fraud scheme that provided more than 500mln dlrs in phony tax losses for many prominent people,including CBS Inc. <CBS> president Laurence Tisch and hisbrother Preston, who is President Reagan's postmaster general.    The indictment was handed down by a federal grand jury toin New York.    The three indicted were named as Charles Atkins, WilliamHack and Ernest Grunebaum, all well-known promoters of taxshelters. Atkins was well-known as an organizer of tax sheltersin the late 1970s and early 1980.    The indictment said that between 1978 and 1983, thedefendants conspired to defraud the government by arranging"rigged and fraudulent" transactions in governmenmt securitiesand false tax deductions based on phony trading losses andinterest expenses.    More than 350 mln dlrs in false deductions were passed onto partners in three tax shelters.    In addition, the defendants sold over 200 mln dlrs in phonytrading losses and interest expenses to other entities andindividuals to be used as tax deductions.    The indictment said that over 1.1 billion dlrs in tradinglosses and interest expenses were generated by the scheme butwere off-set by "fictious gains."    Laurence Tisch was said by the indictment to have reporteda net loss of 1.1 mln dlrs. His brother, Preston Tisch,reported a loss of 480,000 dlrs.    None of the three men's clients were charged with anycriminal acts. But should the three be found guilty, theirclients will be required to pay taxes they originally avoidedthrough the tax shelter scheme, plus interest and possiblypenalties.  Reuter

JOHN LABATT SEES GOOD FOURTH QUARTER, YEAR <John Labatt Ltd> anticipates a goodfourth quarter and a new peak in sales and earnings for thefiscal year ending April 30, president Peter Widdrington toldfinancial analysts.    He would not make any specific forecast, but said he wasoptimistic for further growth in fiscal 1988 in the company'sbrewing and food products operations.    Labatt's earnings rose to 92.8 mln dlrs in the nine monthsended January 31 from year-earlier 78 mln dlrs. Revenue for thenine months rose to 3.20 billion dlrs from 2.70 billion dlrs.    Widdrington said Labatt's three-year business plan, nowbeing updated, targets total sales of about six billion dlrs,including 2.50 billion dlrs in the U.S.    Labatt, Canada's leading brewer, has expanded in the U.S.food products industry by acquisitions.    Widdrington said Labatt's strategy for U.S. expansionstemmed partly from its strong market position in the Canadianfood and beverage industry. The U.S. share of revenues for thisyear will be about 35 pct, rising to 40 pct in fiscal 1988, hesaid. Reuter

FERC DECISION COULD CUT COLUMBIA GAS <CG> NET Columbia Gas System Inc said aFederal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on naturalgas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25dlrs a share.    The company said "this could bring earnings for 1987 belowColumbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrsper share dividend." It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986.    It said management expects to recommend to the board thatthe dividend rate be maintained in 1987.    Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may beoffset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future taxliabilities under the new federal tax laws.    The company recorded these liabilities based on older,higher tax rates, but an action being considered by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain ofabout 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained.    "Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned,"Columbia Gas said.    Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit therecovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia GasTransmission Corp, the company's principal pipeline subsidiary.    It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchasedgas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related toamortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchasecontracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiaryfailed to sufficiently support cost recovery.    The company said its subsidiary is not precluded frommaking a new filing to provide sufficient support. Reuter

SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and constructiongroup, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturerlast year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian ArsenalsLtd from the Canadian government.    The impact of that and several smaller deals will be feltfully in 1987, Taylor said.    Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations willaccount for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helpingto counterbalance the more cyclical engineering andconstruction acivities, Taylor said.    Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a smallextraordinary gain.    In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generateabout 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering andconstruction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defenseproducts operations should be a major contributor to earnings.

SOUTHWESTERN BELL <SBC> SEES EARNINGS DILUTION Southwestern Bell Corp said thatits planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and pagingsystems, including those of <Metromedia Inc>, will result insome initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio.    In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, theregional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earningsdilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in itsdebt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt levelwithin an acceptable range.    In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Belllisted a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from43.7 pct in 1985.    In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a sharein 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billiondlrs.    Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have anegative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss ofinvestment tax credits.    By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporatetax rate should have a positive impact on its net income andcash flow.    In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pctgain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pctincrease in long distance calling volumes.    Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will belower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in whichexpenditures were held below budget. Reuter

VARITY<VAT> SEES IMPROVED RESULTS AFTER 1ST QTR Varity Corp, earlier reporting a fullyear loss against a prior year profit, said improvement isexpected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill theinventory pipeline, cutbacks in operating costs are realizedand its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fullyintegrated.    However, operating results are likely to remain underpressure in the first quarter ending April 30, it said.    Varity earlier reported a loss for fiscal 1986 endedJanuary 31 of 23.3 mln U.S. dlrs, compared to a year-earlierprofit of 3.9 mln dlrs.    Varity said continued deterioration in major markets, aweakening U.S. dollar and unforeseen delays in launching majornew lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss.    Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erodeduring the latest fiscal year, with worldwide industry retailsales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year'sdepressed levels, the company said.    However, Varity increased its share of the global tractormarket by more than one pct to 18.2 pct, it said.

LINDE TURNOVER UP IN FIRST TWO MONTHS OF 1987 Engineering group LindeAG's <LING.F> world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks inthe first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said.    But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mlnmarks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excludingexchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct andincoming orders increased 1.0 pct.    Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales thisyear but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln.    Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the sameperiod last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln.    Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marksnominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximumissue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capitalcurrently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks.    Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company thenecessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds foracquisitions. He declined to give further details.    While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billionmarks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation ofthe mark against major trading partner currencies, incomingorders would have been four pct above the prior year's level.    World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge.    World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05billion marks.

HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> said in astatement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite afall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.    The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar andother currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressureon selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices ofcrude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale ofpolystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.    World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01billion from 42.72 billion.    Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billionmarks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.    The statement made no mention of net profit figures.Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.    In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by thecold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continuesat present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below theprevious year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from1986, Hoechst said.    Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and informationtechnology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.    Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance ofthe parent company, other units in West Germany, and to<American Hoechst Corp>.    Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected therestructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.    Roussel Uclaf <RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidatedpartners did not perform as well as in 1985.    Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretaxprofits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earningsfrom interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall inextraordinary costs.    The fall in raw material prices was not enough tocompensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices andcurrencies, Hoechst said.    The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in newprojects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capitalincrease of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with theacquisition of <Celanese Corp>.

SIEMENS SEES SALES NEAR 52 BILLION MARKS THIS YEAR World group turnover of Siemens AG<SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the currentyear to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first fivemonths, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.    Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02billion marks.    Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly dueto payment in January for a West German nuclear power stationwhich led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.    In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed athree pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.    In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.    For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise betweenone and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.    Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, thecommunications and telecommunications sectors in particularshould contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.    But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of thedollar, Kaske said.    Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 groupnet profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in thesame period in the previous year.    Turnover in the first five months rose particularlystrongly in the installations and automotive technology,communications and telecommunications sectors, but componentsand energy and automation showed a sharp decline.    Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks inthe first five months of this year, or nine pct above theirlevel in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular byorders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.    Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. Anincrease in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroadwas balanced by the decline in the dollar.    While the installations and automotive technology sectorshowed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation andcommunications orders were below the level achieved in the sameperiod of 1985/86.    Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the samelevel.    Kaske said investments were expected to remain around sixbillion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previousyear. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover. REUTER
KRUPP HAS SATISFACTORY 1986 RESULTS The Fried. Krupp GmbH<KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.    Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.    Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar'sweakness against the mark and oil and raw materials pricefalls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.    The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery andplant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.    Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineeringbusiness achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions hadunderpinned machinery and component activities.    An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, thetrading and services sectors, affected the group's total orderfigures.    However, "all business sectors contributed to the positiveresults achieved in 1986," Krupp added, without giving details.    Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marksfrom the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct oforders against 40 pct in 1985.    Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11member companies which comprise the core area of the group,rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.    The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks atend-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.    Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased bythree pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.    The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration inforeign trade and a downturn in a number of customerindustries.    The difficult market for sections and flats of qualitysteel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainlesscold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.

LUCAS SEES CONTINUED GROWTH IN SECOND HALF Lucas Industries Plc <LUCS.L> said itsunderlying performance would continue to improve in the secondhalf but profits would be restrained by low activity in U.K.Commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in NorthAmerican electronics.    The company earlier reported a two mln stg rise in pretaxprofit to 40 mln in the six months to end-January. The figurewas some five mln below forecasts and Lucas shares droppedsharply to 557.5p at 1130 GMT from last night's close of 590p.    It said it would continue with plans for all its activitiesto be internationally competitive and profitable.    Costs of restructuring, reorganisation, employee trainingand retraining, particularly in the UK automotive businesses,together with high research and development spending wouldaffect profits in the short term.    But Lucas said it was exploiting growth opportunities inautomotive markets, especially in vehicle breaking and enginemanagement systems. Recent acquisitions in North America hadstrengthened Lucas Aerospace and Lucas Industrial systems. REUTER
FIRST INTERSTATE <I> ESTIMATES LOSS ON BRAZIL First Interstate Bancorp ChairmanJoseph Pinola said the bank holding company would lose about 16mln dlrs per year, after taxes, if it had to put its medium andlong-term debt on non-accrual status.    In an interview, he said that could result in about a 4.5pct decline in annual earnings per share.    Pinola said First Interstate, like other banks, has not yetdecided to put the loans, which Brazil stopped paying intereston last month, on non-accrual status.    "None of us really wants to injure negotiations that mightbe going on," he said.    First Interstate reported to the Securities and ExchangeCommission last week that it has about 339 mln dlrs inmedium-to long-term loans to Brazil.    It said on December 31, 1986 its nonperformind Brazilianoutstanding debt totaled about 4.1 mln dlrs.    First Interstate also has about 168 mln dlrs in short-termloans or trade lines to Brazil.    Pinola said he believes the solution to the Brazilian debtcrisis will be more political than economic, which he said hefinds, "very disquieting and discomforting." Reuter

BEST PRODUCTS CO INC 4TH QTR SHR 1.44 DLRS V Belgian banks will need greaterflexibility to choose their sphere of operations by 1992, whenthe European Community is due to introduce free competition inbanking throughout the bloc, Generale de Banque SA <GENB.BR>president Eric de Villegas de Clercamp told a news conference.    He said at present Belgian and Italian banks were the mostrestricted in the EC.    While German banks were free to hold stakes in commercialcompanies in which they invested capital, Belgian banks coulddo so only in severely limited circumstances for short periods.    "The authorities concerned should introduce within areasonable period major modifications toward greater freedomand flexibility if we want to retain competitiveness with theneighbouring countries," de Villegas said.    He said the EC authorities envisaged that after 1992financial institutions would be able to start operationsthroughout the EC.    Since the control of each institution would remain in thehands of the authorities in its country of origin, rulesapplied in member states could distort competition unless theywere harmonised. REUTER

After an extraordinary expense associated with theDecember, 1986 withdrawal of a planned common share offering,"we expect to be modestly profitable for the year, but below the410,000 dlrs earned in fiscal 1986," the company said.

"First quarter results will be dramatically better," hesaid following a presentation to analysts. He cited a sharpdrop in non-earning assets, healthy asset growth and lowerexpenses.    He declined to predict specific results for the firstquarter. In the 1986 first quarter, the commerical financecompany earned 606,000 dlrs, or eight cts per share.    Gevirtz also declined to predict full year results, butsaid, "We expect an excellent year." In 1986 Foothill earned3,239,000 dlrs, or 41 cts per share.    Analysts expect Foothill to record earnings of 65 cts to 85cts a share in 1987.

Previously, the company had said first quarter resultswould likely be lower than for the 1986 period due toproduction disruptions caused by the large number of productionline changes scheduled during the first quarter, its statementpointed out.    While the disruptive effects of the production line changeshad occurred in line with expectations, Anchor Glass said,first quarter operating results were helped by lower thananticipated operating costs and improved margins on sales as aresult of a more favorable product mix.

He told shareholders the company has a 190 mln dlr exposurein loans to Brazil if that country defaults on its debtpayments. If a default does occur, it would first quarterearnings by about five cts a share, which would bring thebank's in the lower level of the estimated range, he added.    Brown noted the 1986 first quarter net included a 17 ctsgain from loan restructurings which will not appear this year.    Brown said the bank's other nonperforming assets, notincluding its Brazilian exposure, could rise to over 700 mlndlrs at the end of this quarter compared with 669 mln dlrs ayear earlier and 614 mln dlrs at the end of 1986.    He said the increase includes all of its Equadorian loanswhich he expects will be ultimately repaid after the companyrecovers from an earthquake earlier this year.    Brown said the increase also includes some Mexican andVenezuelan loans as those nations are also facing creditproblems.    Brown said the Bank of Boston remains "cautiously optimiticabout the full year even if our Brazilian exposure were to beon nonaccural all year." In 1986, the bank earned 3.69 dlrs ashare, or 232.8 mln dlrs on net interest revenues of 1.08billion dlrs.    President Ira Stepanian told the shareholders's meeting thebank's total loans to Argentina, Brazil and Mexico totaled 875mln dlrs at the end of 1986, 37 pct of its primary capital.Brazil loans total 300 mln dlrs, of which about two-thirds areaffected by its suspension of interest payments on its mediumand long term foreign debt.

NORCEN SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987 EARNINGS <Norcen Energy Resources Ltd>,41 pct owned by <Hees International Corp>, said earnings andcash flow will improve in 1987, even if oil and gas pricesremain at 1986 levels.    The improvement will result from production increases,lower taxes and royalties, reduced financing costs and fromoperating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during1986, the company said in the annual report.    Norcen previously reported 1986 earnings, excluding a 20.1mln dlr writeoff, declined by 58 pct to 50.0 mln dlrs from119.7 mln dlrs in in 1985.    Norcen's 1986 cash flow fell 10 pct to 204.9 mln dlrs from228.9 mln dlrs in the prior year.    It said the sharp decline in oil prices during 1986 was themost significant factor for Norcen's reduced performance.    "While financial results are far from the previous year'srecord levels, it is clear that Norcen has withstood decliningprices and remains financially and operationally strong," Norcensaid. It did not give a specific 1987 profit forecast.

ENTERTAINMENT PUBLICATIONS SEES 31 CTS/SHR 3RD QTR LOSS ON UNITS  The Polish government has backed downfrom some proposed price rises in the face of strong oppositionfrom trade unions, but has restated its commitment to economicreforms entailing tougher discipline and austerity measures.    Following a warning from the officially-backed OPZZ unionsthat sharp price hikes could spark confrontation, thegovernment has agreed that food prices this year will rise anaverage 9.6 pct instead of the planned 13 pct.    A statement last night said the government had "partiallyaccepted" demands for the protection of the low-paid and agreedto extend some social benefits.    But Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, at a separatemeeting yesterday, sharply criticised the slow pace of reforms.    He told an economic commission that tougher discipline andausterity measures, greater efficiency and initiative shouldreplace waste, red tape and inertia. He announced cost-cuttingmeasures affecting central administrative bodies.    OPZZ economic expert Zbigniew Kochan welcomed the move onfood prices. "This decrease was considerable," Kochan toldReuters today. "Also important is the fact that the governmentadmitted we were right and agreed to consult us over pricesfrom now on," he added.    The communique made no mention of curbs on wage increases,or price rises in sectors including transport and energy.    The authorities have said prices could go up by as much as26 pct as state subsidies are sharply reduced in an effort tomake the market more free and to improve efficiency.    The OPZZ unions are officially recognised by the governmentand replaced the Solidarity movement suppressed under martiallaw. They claim a membership of seven million.    Western diplomats said today the climb-down on food priceswas a limited concession. "This is a small price to pay if theycan push through the other price rises," one said, adding thatfuel and energy rises would have a more significant effect.    He noted that there had been a concerted media campaign toprepare people for price rises, including a major article in amass-circulation women's magazine, "clearly aimed at those whodo the shopping," he said.    Other articles in the official press this week have focusedon coal, which sells to both industrial and private consumersat far less than either the production or export costs.    Countering scepticism from opposition sources and formerSolidarity activists as to OPZZ's role, Kochan said "It wasdefinitely not a question of gaining credibility, but trueconcern for people's living standards."    Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Koziol said the authorities'main aim was not to harm workers' living standards. But he wasalso quoted by the official PAP news agency as saying thegovernment had to take current economic realities into account. REUTER

GREAT AMERICAN <GTAM> SEES CHARGE, WRITEDOWN Great American Corp saidpreliminary findings by regulatory examiners of its AMBANKsubsidiary will result in a first quarter charge of 14.1 mlndlrs and a writedown of 1.4 mln dlrs.    The charge will be made against the allowance for possibleloan losses, and the writedown is of other real estate.    Great American said the examiners were conducting a regularexamination and a final report is not expected for severalweeks. Management intends to include the charge and writedownin response to the preliminary findings.    Great American said regulatory authorities are notrequiring an adjustment of the previously reported financialresults for Great American for 1986.    However, Great American has revised its previous estimatesof provisions for possible losses and has added 9.9 mln dlrs tothe allowance account as of December 31, 1986. It said it tookthe action since the charge-offs will significantly deplete itsallowance for possible loan losses and the economic environmentdoes not show signs for significant improvement in the nearfuture.    It said the additional provision increases the allowance to26.4 mln dlrs, representing 6.63 pct of the outstanding loanportfolio and 83.2 pct of non-performing loans at year-end.    Great American said its revised net loss for the fourthquarter is 14.1 mln dlrs, or 6.36 dlrs per share, compared to anet loss of 2.4 mln dlrs or 1.06 dlrs per share the yearearlier. Reuter

The British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> unit attributed thedeficit to stock losses arising from the drop in crude pricesin the first half, when it made a 119.93 mln dlr loss.    It said government compensation, in the form of subsidiesto refiners to partially cover stock losses, together withimproved crude prices in the second half, enabled the group'soil business to make a modest pre-tax profit.    BP Australia said it had not recommended a dividend.    Commenting on the year's performance, the company said itsuspended operations at the 60 pct-owned Agnew Nickel minebecause of losses sustained from declining nickel prices.

JARDINE MATHESON PLANS FOUR-FOR-ONE BONUS ISSUE Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd<JARD.HKG> said it planned a bonus issue of four new "B" sharesof 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value twodlrs.    A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total1987 dividend of four cents per "B" share, while the "A" sharedividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents ashare.    Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985.    Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said.    It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Mathesonachieved the good performance through satisfactory results inmost sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG>,Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan.    He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong KongLand, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of areorganisation, is "a long term investment and now stands at alevel which causes us no financial strain or problems of assetimbalance."    Keswick said the issue of new "B" shares will give the group"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares forexpansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability whichhas been brought about through the group's recentrestructuring."    He said the new issue is pending approval from both thefirm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriateadjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.    The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation,with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land tothe new unit <Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>.    Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the twocompanies spun off from Hk Land -- <Mandarin OrientalInternational Ltd> and <Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd>-- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.    Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrslast year, will become debt free after the restructuring.    "A positive cash flow from operations and disposals,continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet,"Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests inairfreight operations, Australian properties and truckingbusiness, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities.    Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against itsgeneral trading business in the Middle East in view of thecontinuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he saidthe operations would be profitable in the longer term.    He said the firm's function "has evolved into one primarilyof strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy."    He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the boardof directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacificregional board. He gave no further details of the change.    Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs atmidday on the Hong Kong stock market. In early trading it hadfallen to 24.30 dlrs because of rumours yesterday that the firmplanned a rights issue. REUTER
BHP SEES STRONG FOURTH QUARTER BUT LOWER YEAR NET The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S>said it expects a strong full year result, helped by sigificantinvestment allowance credits in the fourth quarter, but netwill fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86ended May 31.    The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28from 813.0 mln a year earlier.    Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln ayear earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November31, BHP said in a statement.    Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end ofshare analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to620 mln dlrs.    BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents afterdeclaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced aone-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1.    The bonus is being made from reserves which will notqualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction ofdividend imputation next July 1.    The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHPsaid.    BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate ofdividend will be maintained on the increased capital.    The level of future dividends will be influenced by theimplications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation,it said.    As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free inshareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits thathave borne the full 49 pct company tax rate.    BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, saidpetroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mlna year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln.    BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflectedgenerally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Straitwhile the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domesticsales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of newplant and some operational difficulties.    The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrsfrom 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase inownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.    The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain, all in the third term,reflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of <Blue CircleSouthern Cement Ltd> offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown. REUTER

WESTINGHOUSE <WX> SEES HIGHER EARNINGS GROWTH Westinghouse Electric Corp saidearnings per share growth will exceed sales growth and will bein the double digit range through 1989.    In 1986, the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share on revenuesof 10.7 billion dlrs.    Speaking at a meeting for securities analysts, DouglasDanforth, Westinghouse's chairman, said the company's salesgrowth target is about 8.5 pct a year for 1988 and 1989, "givenan economic environment that remains on a moderate growthcourse." He also said the company will make acquisitions, buthe did not specify particular targets.    Paul E. Lego, senior executive vice president told theanalysts "our plans do not call for a multibillion dlracquisition, even though our balance sheet can handle one.Despite this disclaimer, if we identify a major acquisitionthat has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we willconsider it." He said the company would consider an acquisitioncandidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse'sprimiary businesses.    Danforth said the corportation was focused in several keyareas including defense electronics, financial services,broadcasting, electrical products and services for constructionand industrial and utility markets.    Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse's sales to growfaster than the markets the corportation serves and "surelyfaster than GNP."    He said earnings per share growth is expected toconsistently exceed the Standard and Poor's 500 index andreturn on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range.    Leo W. Yochum, senior executive vice president for finance,told the analysts "we will consider buying back stock" butthere are no current plans for such a buyback.    Yochum said that at the company's current level of earningsit could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and thatWestinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholdervalue.    Last year, Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrsrestructuring reserve to be used for plant consolodation,assett writedowns and other items. Yochum said, the companyspent 306 mln dlrs of that reserve in 1986 and will spend 344mln dlrs of the reserves in 1987. The balance will be used in1988.

GALACTIC <GALCF> ADOPTS CONSERVATIVE ACCOUNTING Galactic ResourcesLtd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, saidit adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar toother gold producers' accounting for exploration costs.    As a result, the company retroactively charged all pastexploration and related administration costs incurred on itsproperties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984.    Under the new policy, all future exploration and relatedadministration costs will be written off to expenses ratherthan capitalized as an intangible asset, it said.    Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mlnU.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediatelydisclose the affect of the change on prior years' results.    The new accounting policy is not expected to adverselyaffect working capital position, future cash flows or thecompany's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, itsaid.    Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs ofcosts concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mlnU.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and othermine developments.    Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, theSummitville mine expenses would have been amortized over thelife of the mine and charged against future earnings.    The change will also result in lower depreciation andamortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs anounce of gold produced in future periods, based on totalestimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.    Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville isexpected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalentproduction since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000ounces. Reuter

SOUTHWESTERN BELL VOTES THREE-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT, 8.8 PCT DIVIDEND  U.S. cotton farmers are likely toplant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on anaverage of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearingup for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 plantingintentions report next Tuesday.    The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpseof what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, whichbegins August 1.    Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to10.9 mln acres.    On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cottonfarmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres.    Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acreshad been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.    Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's gooddemand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analystssaid those factors make cotton a profitable crop.    "With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there isgoing to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.Soybeans are dirt cheap," said Lisbeth Keefe of CargillInvestor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cottonmarket specialists.    Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead toincreased acreage, analysts said.    They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmerswho used part of their crop as collateral for government loanswere not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton ingovernment warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the governmentwill not pick up the tab for storage.    Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers fromparticipating in the program, which could result in morecotton. "The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of25 pct of a farmer's base acreage," noted Judy Weissman ofShearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not toparticipate in the program are free to plant all the acreage they have.    Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yieldingWestern states would be most likely to steer clear of theprogram. "Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct," saidone commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in parton forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during itsannual meeting in late January.    But others disagreed. "I think some Western growers havedecided they should be in the program for security reasons.There's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed thegovernment's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside theprogram is subject to the wiles of the market," said WalterBrown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.    Some cotton specialists said their expectations forincreased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's plantingintentions report. "Anything the USDA is announcing now isbased on information they gathered before their cotton programwas announced (on March 20)," one analyst cautioned. She saidtraders will get a better idea of next year's cotton outputwhen the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9.    Brown took that opinion a step further. "I don't thinkplanted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonmentrate," the difference between acreage planted and acreageharvested.    Brown said the abandonment rate this year was "pretty high"at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producingstates. "More normal would be about six pct," he said. Reuter

HONEYWELL BULL SEES REVENUE GROWTH Honeywell Bull Inc, owned by HoneywellInc <HON>, <Cie des Machines Bull> and <NEC Corp>, said itexpects its 1987 revenues to increase 15 to 20 pct over itscurrent level of about 1.9 billion dlrs.    Honeywell Bull president Jerome Meyer also told the pressconference the company was profitable, adding the company aimedto improve profits over time.    Honeywell Inc earlier today received 527 mln dlrs in cashfor the sale of 57.5 pct of its computer business to Bull andNEC. Honeywell will retain a 42.5 pct interest in HoneywellBull and Bull will own an equal amount.    NEC owns 15 pct of the company.    Meyer, who had been executive vice president of HoneywellInformation Systems, said Honeywell Bull would work closelywith NEC and Bull in both developing new products and marketingcomputers to multi-national companies.    "We haven't been growing as fast as we'd like, but we aregoing to turn that around," Meyer said. He said business was soft in the U.S.    He said the company was reorganizing its distributionprograms and its staff, reassigning and laying off selectedemployees. He also said the company was hiring new workers.    Honeywell Bull chairman Jacques Stern, who is also chairmanof Bull, said he believed the computer industry could be a fastgrowing market for companies that provide the type of computerscustomers want. "I don't believe in the slump of the market,"he said.    The computer company would offer open systems so thatcustomers would not be tied to a specific vendor orarchitecture, and it will also focus on tying computerstogether through communications networks.

BFG PARTIAL OPERATING PROFITS FALL SHARPLY IN 1986 Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG<BKFG.F>, BfG, partial operating profits fell to 182.6 mlnmarks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholderAachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG <AMVG.F>, AMB, said.    But total operating and extraordinary profits, includingearnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's ownaccount and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms,were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said.    BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB'scapital increase, which is to finance the insurance company'sacquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.    Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid anunchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred anunchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company,<Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from whichAMB has acquired the majority stake.    The bank has said its business last year suffered from theturbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housingconcern Neue Heimat.    AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.    The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in theinterest margin to 1.9 pct.    A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.    The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step uprisk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasisedbecause of the continuing difficulties of some countries.    Disclosed risk provisions, which under West Germanaccounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.    BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pctof this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.    BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01pct of <Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9pct of <BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> andfive pct of <Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linkedto AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG.    These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transferagreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions. REUTER

ARBED SEES NEED TO MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON COSTS The recent deterioration in thesteel market makes it important for Arbed SA <ARBB.BR> tomaintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in astatement.    It reported that its competitive position had weakenedconsiderably in the second half of 1986, leading to a seven pctcut in steel output over the whole of the year to 3.74 mlntonnes.    Arbed had managed to make a 890 mln franc net profit,slightly down from the 1.12 billion profit in 1985, thanks tolower raw material costs and prudent management, the companysaid.    Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the marketdeteriorate further, but the decision of the European Communityto maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally,should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect.    EC ministers have agreed to extend a quota productionsystem while discussions continue on an industry plan forcapacity reductions.

BASF <BASF.F> SAYS 1986 RESULTS AFFECTED BY DLR BASF AG saidthe volatile currency situation last year, particularly thefall of the dollar, led to sharp drops in turnover denominatedin marks and to price reductions for exports from domesticproduction.    But in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the groupsaid it expected satisfactory business development over thenext months. "At the moment we do not expect any extraordinaryinfluences such as there were last year," it said. Orders inhand and incoming orders were steady at a high level.    BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-taxprofit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985.    The unusual situation on the crude oil market last yearalso produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector andforced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said.    The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses onstocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. Inthe parent company, the positive earnings developmentcontinued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover wasbalanced out by increased capacity use and price declines inraw materials.     In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47billion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell8.5 pct to 18.72 billion.    Turnover increases, with the exceptions of the sectors finechemicals and informations systems, had only been achieved inthose areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985.    Results from these had been taken only partly into thefourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data.    So far in the current year, the investment volume of theparent company and the world group is exceeding that in 1986,BASF said, without giving concrete figures. REUTER

CANADA BANKS COULD SEE PRESSURE ON BRAZIL LOANS Canada's major banks will likely facestiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performingif, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after theend of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said.    American bankers said last week that slow progress in debttalks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. bankswould soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing.    Such action "would put a lot of pressure on the Canadianbanks to do the same," Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bankanalyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters.    "They (banks) like to appear to be conservative," saidPulcine, "and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performingbasis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lotof pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is consideringthe loans non-performing and another bank is not."    Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said anywillingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp<CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather thanlet Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compellingexample for other creditor banks.    "In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) haveto have the support of the other banks," said Meredith.    Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltdsaid at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify,"wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basisand is trying to encourage the others to take that position."    Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrsby Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments onits 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.    Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 daysbefore declaring loans on which they are receiving no interestas non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days.They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans untillate May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter endingJuly 31.    <Bank of Montreal>, Brazil's largest Canadian bankcreditor, said last week it was not currently consideringdeclaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans asnon-performing.    "I think that is just for the benefit of the public," Walshsaid of Bank of Montreal's statement.     Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadianbanks from a move to declare the Brazilian loansnon-performing.    They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments bythe banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banksto recoup their lost interest income.    "From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the bankswill get the money," said Meredith. "My outlook at this point isoptimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year'searnings."    Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of3.80 dlrs for <Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in1986; 4.30 dlrs for <Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25dlrs for <Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with2.23;  2.15 dlrs for <Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94,and 2.85 dlrs for <Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74.    She forecast 1.90 dlrs for <National Bank of Canada>against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split.    Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earningsestimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share,assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs.    "If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of thefiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts ashare. But I don't see that as a likely scenario," Pulcine said.    Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that theBrazilian debt situation was so complex that "it could drag onbeyond one full fiscal year."    He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earningsforecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearlyinterest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrsor about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings. Reuter
VENEZUELA PLANS METALS INVESTMENT FOR 1987-89 The Venezuela Guayana Corporation, CVG,which oversees the state steel, iron, aluminum and otherindustries, will invest 75 billion bolivars in new projectsduring 1987-89, CVG president Leopoldo Sucre Figarellaannounced.

Among the best performers was steel company Sidor whichearned 1.019 billion bolivars, the first time since 1978 Sidorturned a profit.

WOODSIDE SAYS LOSS REFLECTS LOWER OIL PRICES Woodside Petroleum Ltd <WPLA.S> saidits 1986 net loss largely reflected the drop in oil pricescombined with a large tax provision.    Woodside earlier reported attributable net loss rose to17.14 mln dlrs in 1986 from 8.73 mln in 1985, although grouprevenue rose to 220.84 mln from 173.50 mln.    It said it should have received a 1.7 mln dlr tax creditbut instead made a 10.04 mln dlr tax provision. This largelyrelated to its <Vamgas Ltd> unit, non-allowable exchange lossesand tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project notrecognised in the accounts.    Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected fullyear sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of theShelf project, against six month sales in 1985.    Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gasand liquids revenue of its 50.6 pct-owned Vamgas unit.    Since the balance date Woodside has accepted a Santos Ltd<STOS.S> takeover offer for Vamgas.    Woodside said a 92.8 mln dlr capital profit on the salewould be included in the 1987 accounts.

LASMO SET TO BENEFIT FROM FUTURE OIL PRICE RISES London and Scottish Marine Oil Plc(Lasmo) <LASL.L> will have an advantage when oil prices riseagain and it is confident this will happen early in the nextdecade, the company said in a statement accompanying results.    Lasmo said its advantage comes from its reserves of oil andgas which at the end of 1986 stood at 210 mln barrels of oilequivalent, a group record. Reserves have increased every yearsince 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year.    The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg,down from 118 mln in 1985.    It said falling oil prices caused the downturn.    The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop inoil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure,which had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mlnstg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand forlower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.    The company said had very few exploration wells committedfor 1987 and therefore retains maximum flexibility in itsexploration program. Even without further success, the existingfields and recent discoveries will contribute significantly toprofit and cash flow for some years to come, it said.    Lasmo shares were down 2p at 251 after the announcement. REUTER

MANNESMANN SEES DIFFICULT YEAR FOR CAPITAL GOODS Mannesmann AG <MMWG.F> expects adifficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chiefexecutive Werner Dieter told a news conference.    Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn inforeign business because of lower energy prices and the highermark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customernations.    Domestic business was also declining and orders for WestGerman engineering goods have been falling since July 1986,Dieter said.    Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.    Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer aset- back, although measures to cut costs, which were startedlast year, were now having an effect.    Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related productsaccounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. Thecompany saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dietersaid had become one of Mannesmann's "strategic aims."    He said the company's drive to combine activities inmechanical and electronic engineering was a particular "pluspoint" for Mannesmann.    Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to takea majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts groupfor an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fallnine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group netprofit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.    It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollarand lack of demand for steel pipe.    Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipewere bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he addedthe company would continue to cut personnel in this sector thisyear. REUTER
 BRITISH CALEDONIAN GROUP ANNOUNCES BIG LOSSES <British Caledonian Group>, Britain'ssecond largest airline, has announced a 19.3 mln stg pretaxloss for the financial year ending last October, compared witha record pre-tax profit of 21.7 mln stg in 1985, chairman SirAdam Thomson told reporters.    A decline in U.S. Transatlantic traffic following terroristattacks in Europe, the U.S. Bombing of the Libya, the Chernobyldisaster and a slump in the oil industry which affected MiddleEast traffic were the main causes of the loss, Thomson said.    He said the poor results were caused by "a range ofexceptional circumstances wholly outside our direct control" andpredicted a return to profitability this year.    Last year, the airline was forced to axe 1,000 jobs, sellsome of its assets and cut the number of its flights across theAtlantic and to the Middle East following the fall in business. REUTER
ESSO MALAYSIA REPORTS HIGHER PROFIT IN 1986 Esso Malaysia Bhd, a unit of ExxonCorp of the U.S., Reported net profit of 70 mln ringgit fromits petroleum and ammonia operations in 1986 compared with 48.7mln in 1985. Chairman Gerald F Cox said the improvedperformance was mainly due to product prices falling moreslowly than crude prices during the year.    He added that total sales volume increased as a result ofhigher offtake by affiliated companies, while inland marketsales were maintained at around the previous year's levels.    But growth prospects in 1987 remained weak and 1986 resultsare unlikely to be repeated in the current financial year. REUTER

Jewelmasters said it expects to report audited results forthe fourth quarter and year in about three weeks. Reuter
J.C. PENNEY DECLARES TWO FOR ONE SPLIT, RAISES Q Pigmeat and beef futures, which havebeen thinly traded on the London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE,despite lower physical prices and the introduction of newcontracts, need more effective marketing, LMFE chairman PatElmer said in his annual report.    In 1986 the Exchange introduced live cattle and pig cashsettlement contracts, representing a move away from theproblems of cash distortions and squeezes, which initialdeliverable "buyers option" contracts created, he said.    Although the physical industry is aware of the market andfollows its prices keenly, this has not been reflected inmarket volume, Elmer said.

CANADA'S AIRLINE PROFITS SEEN HIGHER Canada's airline industry, shaken up bya recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor forgovernment-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drivefor profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.    "Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,"said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd."Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market."    The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlrtakeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small butcash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last weekas Canadian Airlines International Ltd.    Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about ninepct.    Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive andcost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the truepotential of the former CP Air, which floundered for fourdecades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian PacificLtd.    They said CP Air's management style had been not muchdifferent from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, becauseneither airline was held accountable to its owners.    "Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, thesetwo airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neitherseemed that concerned about the bottom line," said Bradley.    "But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be veryconscious of profitability and shareholder return. And AirCanada is on the verge of going that way," he said.    CP Air, always fighting for market share rather thanprofits, was "a perennial money-loser," analyst Wilfred Hahn ofBache Securities Inc said in a recent report.    Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulatedlong-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, itslosses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.    Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later thisyear in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs onrevenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of morethan 2 billion dlrs.    Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold tothe public, the prospect of privatization at a time ofincreased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay moreattention to finances, analysts said.    It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit "inexcess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs" for 1986. However, this profitrecovery was due less to management skill than the fact thatall Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.    Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 inVancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.    For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct airtraffic growth, and they expect profits will come fromcost-cutting and careful spending.    Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd saidinstitutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to theirportfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that newcompetition makes profit growth less certain.    "The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. Atone time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobodyelse's," Friend said.    Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airlineshares for at least a year.    Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of apublic stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routeswithout setting off a political storm.    It also will be faced with an expensive but necessaryupdating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.    Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase ofa dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie.    Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week orderedsix commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it wouldsoon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or theBoeing Co.    Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these withouthurting profits.    Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects CanadianAirlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western. Reuter

PENNZOIL SEES LOWER 1ST QTR NET BEFORE UNUSUAL ITEM AGAINST YEAR AGO LOS Presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater shrugged off yesterday's sharp decline on WallStreet, saying the administration believes the stock market is"fundamentally sound."    Fitzwater attributed Monday's 57 point drop in the DowJones industrial average at the closing bell to "technicaldecisions" and said President Reagan's decision to impose tradesanctions against Japan might have also contributed.    "There are a lot of reasons that can cause this, but theunderlying fact is that we believe the market is very strongand sound," he said.    Fitzwater said the stock market had risen 239 pct sinceReagan took office on January 20, 1981.    "The market, we believe, is fundamentally sound," he said.    The presidential spokesman noted that at mid-day, themarket had recovered some of the losses that occurred onMonday, when the third-worst one-day slump in Wall Streethistory occurred. REUTER

WALL STREET STOCKS/AMES DEPT STORES <ADD> Ames Department Stores Inc fell 1-7/8to 23 in what analysts said was a reaction to a surpriseannouncement earlier today by the company that earnings in thefiscal year ended January 31 will decline sharply.    Ames said it expects to report earnings of between 72 and77 cts per share compared with 1.19 dlrs per share in theprevious year.    "We were looking for 1.15 dlrs," said an analyst at a majorWall Street firm who declined to be identified. Ames said mostof the decline resulted from an inventory shortage at itsSecaucus, N.J. distribution center.    "The obvious suspicion is that there has been some kind offraud or theft," said Ralph Shulansky, senior vice president ofAmes. "We do not have hard evidence we are still putting thingstogether."    He said it would take several weeks for the company tocomplete an investigation. He said there are no law enforcementofficials involved at this time.    He declined to quantify the inventory shortage but said itwas the major reason for the decline in earnings. A decline ingross margin percentage and an increase in the effective taxrate also contributed to the downturn, Ames said. Reuter

1ST CENTRAL FINANCIAL <FCC> SEES HIGHER EARNINGS First Central Financial Corp said itexpects earnings to rise significantly in 1987 and said it isactively seeking an acquisition.    The property and casualty insurance company's chairman andchief executive officer, Martin J. Simon, told Reuters in aninterview that he expects earnings of 33 cts a share in 1987compared with 25 cts a year ago.    He said, "the company currently has the sufficient momentumto achieve those earnings and the successful completion oflicensing applications to operate in Pennsylvania, Delaware,Connecticut and Ohio should fuel our earnings."    The company is currently licenced to operate only in NewYork state.    Simon estimated that the company would earn seven cts ashare in the first quarter compared to three cts in the samequarter a year ago, and eight cts a share in the second quartercompared to five cts earned in 1986. He expects the company toearn nine cts a share for each of the final two quarters of1987.    In addition, Simon said, First Central Financial "isactively looking for, and has several acquisition brokerslooking for a small life insurance company to acquire."    He said the acquisition should be in the 10 mln dlr rangeand will be part of a strategy of expanding the company into a"wide spectrum of insurance services." No specific company hasbeen targeted as yet, "but I would like to make my firstacquisition in 1987," he said.    He said First Central Financial would not itself be an easytakeover target. It wants to remain independent, he said, andhas implemented a staggered board of directors system.

DOME PETE<DMP> TAKES 2.08 BILLION DLR WRITEDOWN Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlierreporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlierprofit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to writedowns totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction indeferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs.    The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreignexchange losses, the company said.    "The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reversesmuch of the progress the company has made in the two previousyears," Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement.    "But even a net loss of this magnitude has very littlebearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome," chairmanMacdonald said.    "It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of thecompany's assets in today's economic environment, and theabsolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenderson a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continuedexistence," he added.    Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan forrestructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs.    Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulatedforeign exchange losses to current expenses because of theuncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan.    Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remainingperiod of the loans to which they apply, it said.    Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarterreduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to acharge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly inthe third quarter.    Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter chargeresulted from a year-end accounting change made under new fullcost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute ofChartered Accountants.    The company said it previously determined a write down ofconventional oil and gas properties was not required atSeptember 30, under the previous method of calculating thelimitation of oil and gas values.    Dome said the most significant accounting change under thenew guidelines is using current oil and gas prices incalculations instead of escalating price forecasts.    Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan precludethe company from making an accurate estimate of futurefinancing costs, which are used in the new accountingcalculations, it said.    As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantiallyconform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securitiesand Exchange Commission, the company said.    Dome said operating income from its crude oil and naturalgas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs.    Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gasoperating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billiondlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue.    Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization ofDome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea alsocontributed to the decline, it said.    Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985.    Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs.    Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintainedat prior year's levels through new drilling activity andimprovements in productivity.    Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result oflower domestic and export sales, it said.    Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year.    Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a dayfrom 591.0 mcf a day.

AUDITORS GIVE FIRST CITY <FBT> QUALIFIED OPINION First City Bancorp of Texas, which losta record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, said in its annual report itexpected operating losses to continue "for the foreseeablefuture" as it continues to search for additional capital or amerger partner.    The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements receiveda qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co.The auditors said their opinion was subject to First Cityeventually obtaining additional capital.    "The company believes that in order to address itslong-term needs and return to a satisfactory level ofoperations, it will ultimately need several hundred milliondollars of additional capital, or a combination with a morestrongly capitalized entity," First City said in a note to itsfinancial statements included in the annual report.    "Management believes that sufficient resources should beavailable to cover interim capital concerns while additionalcapital is being sought," the bank said.    To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sellor mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributionsto its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some ofits member banks.    "The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially lessthan in 1986," First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letterincluded in the annual report. "However, the ultimate return tosatisfactory operating conditions is dependent on thesuccessful resolution of the related problems of creditquality, funding and the eventual need for substantialadditional capital."    First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of acredit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most ofFirst City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments wouldbe modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoiddefault.    The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenantslast year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks.    Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratiosexceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986,First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. FirstCity National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio.    Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estateprices, First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrslast year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more thandoubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of1986.    First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its totalenergy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billiondlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs "shouldbe more modest." The amount represented 15 pct of First City'stotal loans.    In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assetsnearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end.Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or ninepct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amountcould go higher.    "The company still faces uncertainties in the real estatemarket and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolioso long as the regional recession persists," First City said."Because the carrying value of many of these loans iscollateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value ofthe collateral base could cause an increase in the level ofreal estate-related chargeoffs."

MORGAN <JPM> PLACES BRAZIL LOANS ON NONACCRUAL J.P. Morgan and Co Inc, parent ofMorgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York, said that it will place1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil on anon-accrual basis, matching similar action by BankAmerica Corp<BAC> earlier today.    The move, which follows Brazil's suspension of interestpayments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt on February20, is expected to reduce first quarter net income by about 20mln dlrs, of which four mln dlrs represents interest accruedprior to 1987 but still uncollected, the bank said.    Morgan earned 233.9 mln dlrs in the first quarter of 1986.    Morgan also said that, based on current interest rates andassuming cash interest payments are not received for the restof the year, 1987 net income would be reduced by about 72 mlndlrs. 1986 net income was 872.5 mln dlrs.    Although U.S. banks do not have to put loans on nonaccrualuntil they are over 90 days past due, Morgan said some of theloans affected by the Brazil payment freeze may reach the90-day limit during the second and third quarters.    Morgan said it assumes talks between Brazil and commercialbank lenders will proceed "expeditiously" and interest paymentswill resume at the earliest practicable date. Reuter

As a result, net income for the first quarter will bereduced by 18 mln dlrs.

U.S. bank accounting guidelines do not require loans to beplaced on nonaccrual unless interest payments are past due 90days or more.  However, Manufacturers Hanover said that, inlight of current circumstances, it was more appropriate torecord income on its Brazilian loans only when cash paymentswere received.    It added that it believes Brazil will reach agreement withits banks on a debt restructuring and that all interestpayments will be received later in 1987.

DEUTSCHE BANK SEES SLOW START TO 1987 Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> has seen aslow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986,management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said.    Credit business declined in the first few weeks of theyear, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weakGerman bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, andtrading in securities also fell. But earnings from currencydealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference.    Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balancesheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion.    Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of theformer Flick group, which have been estimated at some onebillion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank'sown account, not included in partial operating profits.    Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through asubsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interestsurplus in a section current earnings from securities andparticipations.    In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from1.45 billion.    As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits.    But it said that total operating profits, including ownaccount trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flicktransaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in theparent bank.    Banking analysts said this put group total operatingprofits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bankoperating profits at over five billion marks.    Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earningsfrom Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of itsunchanged 12 mark dividend.    The bank had decided against raising the dividend itselfbecause of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986,and developments so far this year showed that was correct,Christians said.    West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they aresure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequentyears, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits.    The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue ahigh level of risk provision, Christians said.    Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in1986 from 765 mln in 1985.    Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarilyreflect the full amount of risk provisions.    Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen saidDeutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallento over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985because of the fall in the dollar.    He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds ofsuch problem country debt had been written off.    Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of "othersecurities," to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in theparent bank.    Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly dueto its increased activity in international share placements,with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's internationalplacement last year remaining on its books.    Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned toplace these shares and conclude the original placement. Reuter
SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH Singapore's major banks arediversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings fromloans to debt instruments, banking sources said.    The banks following the trend are the <Overseas Union BankLtd>, <United Overseas Bank Ltd>, <Oversea-Chinese BankingCorporation> and the <Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>.    The shift towards securitisation has been helped byvolatile financial markets which have developed hedgingfacilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for riskmanagement, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.    Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks seelimited growth in credit risk. More and more of them areswitching from term lending to major growth areas such asstockbroking and fee based income, he said.    Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after beinggranted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are nowmoving into the new government securities market and the StockExchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.    One foreign banker said the Development Bank and theOverseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equitymarket in Singapore.    Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market hasincreased business transactions and provided long term growthfor the market. The banks are not competition for individualstockbroking firms because of the increased business theygenerate, he added.    Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expandequity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year becauseof the increasing ability of foreign and local marketparticipants to absorb new issues.    Loh said <OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary ofthe Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm tolaunch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investorsseeking capital growth through a diversified internationalportfolio. It will invest in international shares with theemphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.    <DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of theDevelopment Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong KongStock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.    Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates inSingapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will beforced to provide fund management services for major clientsseeking better returns, he said.    Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the majorbanks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income fromtreasury and investment banking activities.    They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chineseand United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pctagainst respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986.    Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.    The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by<National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiaryof the bank, they said.

Reckitt and Colman plc pretax profits 1986 yr 145.11 mln stg vs 12 A Japanese businessman announced plans fora new telecommunications firm in which Britain's Cable andWireless Plc would be a core company.    However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation ofEconomic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does notspecify what stake Cable and Wireless would have.    "The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,"Watanabe said in a statement. "The actual percentage ofshareholdings should be agreed by the core companies."    He said the eight core companies will provide directors forthe firm.    "The new company shall immediately set to work on thefeasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,"Watanabe said.    Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups,one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against<Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which now monopolizes Japan'soverseas telephone business.    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wantsonly one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts.    A British source, who declined to be identified further,said the proposals could open the door to further talks betweenC and W <CAWL.L> and the other firms involved.    C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal whichwould have given it a five pct share in the newtelecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pctstake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stakein one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge.    The British source said the decision not to specify theexact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the dooropen for further discussion.    "It's probably a sensible approach on their part," theBritish source told reuters.    C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay anew cable between Japan and the U.S.    The proposed merger has sparked an international row, withBritish government sources threatening retaliatory actionagainst Japan for what they see as discriminatory practicesagainst foreign firms.    The sources said last Friday that one option for Britainwould be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securitiescompanies operating in London.    The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans,saying that both rival consortia should be licensed.    Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms,Watanabe said, "They will not be core companies but if they wishthey could participate." Under the Japanese law, total foreignparticipation would be limited to one-third.    "It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which hasthe support of many influential backers and work within thisfor the realization of their ideas," Watanabe told reporters.    The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.T>, Mitsuiand Co <MITS.T>, Sumitomo Corp <SUMT.T>, Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co <MC.T>, Toyota Motor Corp <TOYO.T>, C Itoh and Co<CITT.T>, and <Pacific Telesis International Inc>.    Watanabe said that his latest proposal represented hisfinal effort.    If it fails to satisfy the British government, it will beup to the Japanese government to explain its position, he said. REUTER
Bayer world group 1986 pre-tax profit 3.30 billion marks (3.15 billion) -  The Finance Ministry has asked trust banksto moderate their dollar selling, trust banking sources said.    A Ministry official told Reuters earlier this week theMinistry had recently surveyed foreign exchange transactions byinstitutional investors, but he declined to say whether thiswas aimed at moderating the dollar sales.    Dealers said institutional investors were reluctant to selldollars aggressively today partly because of the Ministrymonitoring.    One senior trust bank source said that while sympathizingwith the Ministry position, the trust banks had to conducttheir foreign exchange operations according to the dictates ofthe market.    A Bank of Japan official said the central bank approved ofthe survey as long it was not used too forcefully.    But another official denied local press reports that thecentral bank itself had asked investors to moderate theirdollar sales. "We are not legally authorized to do that," hesaid.    A Bank of Japan official also said the central bank willrenew its call on financial institutions to moderate excessiveloans for the purpose of land and securities investment as suchinvestments threaten to cause inflation.    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita had previouslyexpressed concern about excessive investment in land andsecurities resulting partly from eased credit conditions. REUTER
BAYER CONFIDENT OF POSTING GOOD 1987 RESULTS Chemicals group BayerAG <BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986.    The company said that this was despite the mark's furtherstrengthening against the dollar and other currencies anddespite an increase in competitive pressure.    "The further progress of our business will depend largely onthe extent to which threats to free trade materialise and onthe developments of exchange rates, raw material and energycosts.    Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billionmarks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72billion from 1.62 billion.    The company gave no net profit figures or any indication ofthe likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985results, up one mark from a year earlier.    Bayer said that world group operating profit declinedslightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showeda further improvement.    Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainlythe sharp fall in the dollar against the mark.    Lower prices on the raw material side had also broughtpressure on selling prices, it added.    In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against1985, the company said without giving details.    "The western Europe, North America and Far East regionsdeveloped well in local currency, but here too the translationof local currency sales into marks distorted the picture,especially in the case of North America," it said.    Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks.    Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986,resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combinedwith savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offsetfalling prices and cost increases in other areas.    The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lowerextraordinary expenses and higher net interest income.Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating rawmaterials all developed well, it said.    Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that worldgroup turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last threemonths of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period.    Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pctto 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower andforeign turnover 8.6 pct lower.    Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarteragainst 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985. REUTER

HOOGOVENS EXPECTS CLEAR LOSS IN 1987 <KoninklijkeNederlandsche Hoogovens en Staalfabrieken NV> said it expecteda "clear loss" for 1987.     The company reported its 1986 profits were 44 pct lower at154.6 mln guilders than in the year before.     Turnover was 18 pct lower than in 1985.     The main reason fo the fall in turnover was the lower rateof the dollar, the company said. The lower costs for rawmaterials and energy, resulting from the lower dollar, couldnot compensate the fall in revenues.

INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY <ITX> SEES 4TH QTR LOSS International Technology corpsaid it expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter endedMarch 31 of about 20 cts per share, compared with ayear-earlier profit of 11 cts.    The company blamed the expected loss on regulatory andpermitting issues that limited the full utilization ofhazardous waste treatment cites in Califoirnia, continuedstartup delays for major remediation projects, the writeoff ofan investment in a subsidiary and a settlem,ent with theCalifornia Attorney General's Office and Department of HealthServices.    The company said the settlement relates to regulatoryviolations alleged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agengyand the California Health Services department at the company'sVine Hill and Panoche treatment facilities in NorthernCalifornia.    It said under the agreement, it will pay the state2,100,000 dlrs in civil penalties over a two-year period andpay 500,000 dlrs over five years to local medical facilities aspart of a community awareness and emergency response programdeveloped by local communities.  The expenses will be chargedagainst fourth quarter results, it said.    The company said it has agreed as well to make complianceand public safety capital expenditures of about 600,000 dlrs.    It said it has now received an operating permit for a new250,000 cubic yard landfill cell at its Imperial County,Calif., from the Health Services department.    The company said the Panoche facility remains closed but isexpected to reopen for liquid and sludge receipts in the nearfuture.  But it said receipts of solid material, which hadaccounted for the majority of the revenue at the site, could berestricted until 1988 pending resolution of capacity issues inthe Panoche site permit.

WESTLB LUXEMBOURG REPORTS LOWER 1986 NET PROFIT Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale<WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLBInternational SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.    WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend toWestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.    The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the recordprofit of the previous year could not be repeated, due tochanged market conditions, it said. Increased funds were alsoallocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of1987 developed positively, it added.    WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks forinternational credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in thebalance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.    Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mlnin 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact thatcredit business redemptions were not fully offset by newlending.    The statement said WestLB International's business withprivate customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.    This development was aided by cooperation between the bankand the savings banks in the West German state of NorthRhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.    Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of1.1 billion.    WestLB International said it plans to expand its range ofservices for private clients. REUTER

MELLON <MEL> SEES LARGE FIRST-QUARTER LOSS Mellon Bank Corp said it expectsto report a loss for the first quarter in the range of 55 mlnto 65 mln dlrs or 2.13 to 2.15 dlrs a share.    The company also said it intends to reduce its secondquarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts.    Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in thefirst quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs incharge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-lossreserve.    It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cashbasis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs.    In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrsor 2.13 dlrs a share.    Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs andincreased provisions address four areas of concern in thebank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector,developing countries, some basic industrial companies andseveral commercial real estate businesses.    Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the firstquarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct ofthe loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct oftotal loans at the end of 1986.    Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of thefirst quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines.    Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986.    Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement inenergy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lackof a substantial recovery in energy prices this year,especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent toincrease reserves and take losses on loans in this sector.    "This action relates both to loans to companies directlyinvolved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers,home builders and financial institutions in the SouthwesternUnited States," Barnes said.    As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mlndlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but hadcharged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt.    He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quitBrazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term creditlines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil andother sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts.    Loans to basic industries were not major contributors tothe increase in non-performing assets or to first-quartercharge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about theabsence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries.    The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continuedmanagement cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon hasthe financial strength to deal with current uncertainties,Barnes said.    "We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presentlytrouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing themaggressively," he added. Reuter

GERMAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SEES LOWER PROFITS West Germany's chemicalindustry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, JosefStrenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said.    Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG <BAYG.F>,told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the maindangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar aswell as crude oil and commodity prices.    Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harmingearnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at thestart of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.    The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, wasbadly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover wasmainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.    Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 andcompetition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings fromlower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by pricecompetition and increased costs.    Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemicalfirms were slightly worse than the year before but the improvedfinancial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,neutralized the negative impact.    Strenger said the industry would try to increase productionin the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out ofWest Germany.    The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall inexports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.    Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far Eastexports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.    Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidencefollowing several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine latelast year. REUTER

WESSANEN FORESEES STRONG PROFIT GROWTH Dutch dairy and general foodsmanufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV <WESS.AS>, said it isplanning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strongprofit growth over the next 10 years.     Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at thepresentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987first quarter profits to show an increase.    The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985.    This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar'sguilder value, van Driel said.    Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guildershigher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985level of 3.20 guilders.    Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mlnguilders down because of the lower dollar and lower rawmaterial prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders.    US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover,compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separatebusinesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide.    Van Driel said the company would continue an activetakeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying morethan its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit.    He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisitionpossibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China.    He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mlnguilders and would if necessary make new share issues.    Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mlndlrs. He said <Balanced Foods> and <Green's Dairy>, taken overlate last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrswhich was not included in the 1986 account.    All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key tothis growth was the successful introduction of new products,which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented USacquisitions, van Driel said.    Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said.    The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich,Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims tobe quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said.    Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not beaccompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehiclesfor the company to raise capital for future expansion.    He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were inforeign hands.    The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made alisting on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step,van Driel said without elaborating.    Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which producesaround 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospectsfor its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said. REUTER

TIME <TL> 1987 EARNINGS MAY BE 4.25 DLRS SHARE Time Inc's chief financial officer,Thayer Bigelow, told security analysts the company is"comfortable" with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earningswill be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share.    In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share,including a number of special items.    Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the specialitems and also removing the earnings of American Television andCommunications Corp <ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in1986.    Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by thecable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directlyin CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs inTurner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest.    Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, aTurner Broadcasting spokesman said.    Bigelow said the company is continuing its previouslyannounced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares werepurchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of81 dlrs per share.    Bigelow said the company will always have a share buybackprogram in place whenever it believes it is a better long-terminvestment than starting or acquring a business. But he did notgive any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mlnshares already announced.       On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman andchief executive said the company is not interested in investingin over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at allareas in which it is currently engaged.    Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time.In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggestacquisition ever.    N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, saidthe company might be interested in a relatively small bookbusiness.    He said following the recent agreement for the sale ofHarper and Row to the News Corp Ltd <NWS>, "there may be piecesthat Murdoch doesn't want," referring to News Corp chairmanRupert Murdoch.    Asked if the company's SAMI business is for sale, Munrosaid it is a "delicate subject", and "we're looking at all theoptions." SAMI is a marketing information service for the foodindustry. Published reports have stated it could be worth asmuch as 500 mln dlrs.       Bigelow said that Time's Home Box Office added  subscriberslast year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of1987. However, he said, HBO's results in the quarter will bedown slightly, but in the first quarter of 1986 there was aspecial gain in the HBO unit.    Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscribergrowth of 800,000 for last year.    He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits andhigher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in thetax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points.    Munro said the company does not plan to increase itsdividend.    Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of AmericanTelevision and Communications, said the unit is looking atgetting involved in the home shopping video area. "It would befoolish not to be a player there," he said.    He said the company had talks with Home Shopping NetworkInc <HSN> prior to that company's public offering last year,but nothing came of the talks. Reuter

U.S. MEAT PROCESSORS ASK FOR LABELLING CHANGE Four U.S. meat processors have askedthe federal government to relax a labelling requirement whichthey said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat,the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co,Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allowmechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels asthe species from which it was derived.    For example, "pork" would be listed on the ingredientsstatement instead of "mechanically separated pork."    Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat productwould have to be stated on the label and the mechanicallyseparated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meatand poultry portion of the product.    Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-costproduct that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.    Current regulations allow use of mechanically separatedingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultryproduct, but require it to be listed in the ingredientstatement as "mechanically separated (species)," USDA said.    USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoidusing mechanically separated meat in their products because theterm carries an "unwarranted negative connotation" in the mindsof many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similarregulation exists for poultry products.    Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcassparts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have someremaining meat, into specialized processing equipment. Reuter

GULF STATES (GSU) SEES END TO CASH BY MAY Gulf States Utilities Co saidits condition has "significantly deteriorated" and that itsoperating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unlessit receives additional financing or rate relief from statepublic utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana.    In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-Kfiling, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified theutility last month that no additional credit would be granted.Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to beginmaking prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more thanthe estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.    "The circumstances increase the likelihood that the companymay have to seek protection from its creditors under thebankruptcy code," Gulf States said.    The utility had previously said it might be forced toconsider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rateincreases granted by state regulators in connection with GulfStates' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.    "If the regulatory commissions approve the company'sproposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases providedfor in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period,the company believes it could achieve financial stability,"Gulf States said.    In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission grantedGulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrscontingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line ofcredit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.    Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana stateregulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs inemergency rate relief.    In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs onsales of 1.85 billion in the previous year. Reuter
CAESARS WORLD BOARD APPROVES RECAPITALIZATION Caesars World Inc <CAW> said itsdirectors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan underwhich stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs pershare via a one-time special cash dividend and will retaintheir common stock ownership in Caesars World.    Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximatelyone billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividendand the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mlndlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired.    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, hastold the company it is confident it can arrange the entirefinancing needed for the recapitalization.    Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of thehotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement theboard believes the recapitalization plan is financiallysuperior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff.    Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommendsthat shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer.    The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday.    "Our ability to restructure along these lines is possibleprimarily because of the financial stability and the strongoperating results achieved by management in recent years," Glucksaid.    He said that after the recapitalization takes effect,proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 isexpected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs.    Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalizationcommon and common-equivalent shares outstanding.    Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook,Gluck said "we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrsin 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lowerinterest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debtincurred in connection with the recapitalization."    He said the company does not usually release projections,but has done so now beause of the significance of therecapitalization.    Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted forstockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June.    The plan will require the approval of stockholders and thatof the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities.    As part of the plan, the company will change its state ofincorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger ofCaesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.    The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will providefor, among other things, a "fair price" provision requiring thatcertain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders beapproved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding sharesheld by such interested stockholders.    Caesars World said in a statement that "the cashdistribution will result in a substantial deficit instockholders' equity." It did not give an estimate of the sizeof this deficit.    But the company said its financial advisors have said theybelieve that after the recapitalization, Caesars World shouldhave the financial flexibility and resources necessary tofinance its current and projected operating and capitalrequirements.

The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987,ending June 30, to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago.    That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen ofSanford C. Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates forthe company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987, compared to hisprevious estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share. Last year the companyearned 70 cts a share.

At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, Marion'spresident Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 "are expected to causeeven the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low."    Lyons said the strong performance in the second half ofthis year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said thatCardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approvedfor the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year.    Crossen said "because Marion is still just a small company,the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottomline." He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs ashare from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share.    "The company has a broad new product pipeline in theindustry and as far as I am concerned, it is the mostinnovative company in the business," he said.

Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad toldReuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiariesoperating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring forinvestment banking away from commercial banking and an economicslump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.    Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries inNorway since 1985.    Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway'ssecond-hand securities and equities markets, to be approvedlater this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements wouldmake profit this year.    Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, butSejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of plannedliberalisation and better economic performance, helped by asteadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.    Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's <CMB.N>subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavylosses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking. REUTER

Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province ofFlevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up anagenda and procedures for meetings between the employers andunions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.    Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 inprotest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the4,000-strong workforce this year.

The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 butZeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against theemployers and they were therefore very likely to restart thecomplicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.

Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrsof medium- and long-term debt on February 22.    U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stopaccruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of "the highpotential of a continued suspension that would result inreaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987."    Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates arereceived for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated thatfull-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.    Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiationsbetween Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to theresumption of interest payments.    The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when centralbank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt thatmatures on April 15.

A dividend of 11 marks wouldbe proposed for the company's new preference shares.    Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval ofthe management board proposal as virtually a formality."Anything else would be more than a surprise," one said.    Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves tomaintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood ataround three billion marks at end-1985. Reuter

ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct willpropel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to recordprofits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,major company executives predicted.    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and anindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAFCorp <GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firmsto aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc <ASH>, theKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping formoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy.    "I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period," saidPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co <DOW>, adding,"There's no major plant capacity being added around the worldnow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improvingthe old ones."    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot ofpaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hikeproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demandfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins upby as much as 300 pct, he said.    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers inHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earnedlast year and predicted it would have the best year in itshistory.    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barreland chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. "I believe the entirechemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,"Oreffice said.    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemicalindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billiondlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemicalindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck andplanning, said Pace's John Dosher.    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boostU.S. chemical exports.    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producersin the early 1980s.    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturershave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring programto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminateunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry offriendly and hostile takeover attempts.    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquireUnion Carbide Corp <UK>, recently offered three billion dlrsfor Borg Warner Corp <BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plasticsand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace <GRA> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizerbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may beheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back onthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such asethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals thatare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.    "Companies like DuPont <DD> and Monsanto Co <MTC> spent thepast two or three years trying to get out of the commoditychemical business in reaction to how badly the market haddeteriorated," Dosher said. "But I think they will eventuallykill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the nichemarket." Some top chemical executives share the concern.    "The challenge for our industry is to keep from gettingcarried away and repeating past mistakes," GAF's Heymancautioned. "The shift from commodity chemicals may beill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by theSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyoutof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plantsalong the Texas Gulf Coast.    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals thatare the building blocks of specialty products.    "This kind of commodity chemical business will never be aglamorous, high-margin business," Cain said, adding that demandis expected to grow by about three pct annually.    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand forplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, woodand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemicalbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided theU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth. Reuter

J.P. MORGAN <JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said itsfirst-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting itspreviously announced decision to place on non-accrual statusits 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.    That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interestpayments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in thefirst three months of 1986.    Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securitiesunderwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mlndlrs in the year-earlier period.    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other tradinglosses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading andunderwriting of Euromarket securities.    Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remaineddifficult last quarter, with floating rate notes sufferingheavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whetherMorgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.    On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loanlosses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreignexchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln andtrust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees andcommissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but netinvestment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the firstquarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fellto 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which meansthat interest can be recorded as income only when payments areactually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resumepayments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance forcredit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs comparedwith 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs aftercharge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a yearearlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related topersonnel costs, Morgan said. Reuter

REUTERS CHAIRMAN URGES FREER INFORMATION FLOWS Exchanges and telecommunicationsauthorities should abolish their restrictions on full and freedissemination of information to the investment and bankingcommunities, Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L> chairman SirChristopher Hogg said.    In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiationshad brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchangesfor fuller, but still not complete, access to market datathrough Reuter services.    "Many other markets maintain restrictions," he added.    Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe thatinformation restrictions protected their interests.    In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting thedistribution of data in order to provide competitive advantageto their own commercial information businesses.    He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in thetelecommunications field, some countries continue to protecttheir state monopolies at the expense of other economicsectors.    "Reuter dealing services remain excluded from suchcountries. As a result, banking communities serving entireeconomies are put at a competitive disadvantage," he added.

HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hopedto maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth tothe 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despitecontinuing investments in a reorganization program and effortsto extend world penetration.    Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mlnguilders, after 265 mln in 1985.    Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe'sleading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.    The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.    Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weakerforeign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.    Further consolidation of foreign companies, including theincrease of its stake in leading Spanish brewery <El AguilaS.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularlyin French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. Thecompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year inrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.    Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profitnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations hadalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by theEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beerinto the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beermarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. "Wehave the beer, but distribution and sales is the importantpoint," van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heinekenhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.    "The question is not if we want to penetrate the Germanmarket, but how we are to do it," van Schaik said, adding thatwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing ataste for foreign beer, the internal structure was veryregionalized.     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible forAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the mostimportant beer growth markets in the long term.     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and withmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, washampered by the lack of hard currencies there.    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine litersper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictionsand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total1986 sales.    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high priceof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientistshave been looking at other possibilities.    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched onthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, whichhad sold successfully, Coebergh said.    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional rawmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer werepopular in Rwanda . "This is a possibility, but we could notpossibly achieve the Heineken flavor," Coebergh said.    Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts topenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in acontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken'smarket potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow thatare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept westernmoney. Reuter

MEDTRONIC <MDT> SEES 15 PCT EARNINGS GROWTH Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pctgrowth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30,1988.    At an analysts meeting here the company said that for theyear ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, orabout 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.    In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.    Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company willimprove market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers andexpand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.    Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their pershare estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will haveheavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.    He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in itsbusinesses and not in its dividends. "Shareholders are betteroff if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividendsor share repurchases," he said.    Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the totalworldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.    He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeuticproducts, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters andlasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and willdouble that by 1995.    Wallin said, "Our objective is to get a hold of newproducts and start building market share if we have to beg,borrow or steal to get into new markets."    In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued witha number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulatorsalso have criticized the industry, citing quality problems anda needless overprescription of pacemakers.    "We have no knowledge of any major problems in ourpacemakers or leads," Wallin said. "We intend to re-establishour company as the quality leader in the industry."    Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, saidthe company intends to diversify internally and throughacquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,such as drug delivery systems.    Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 doesnot include dilutions from acquisitions. "We hope to have somesafety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutionsfrom an acquisition."    Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivityin rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.    The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamberpacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physicalactivity.    Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing arate responsive pacemaker.    Reuter

SHOWBOAT <SBO> TO TAKE CHARGE, SEES 3RD QTR LOSS Showboat Inc will take acharge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for thethird quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to thepresident J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.    He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses ofits recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casinoand Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarterand probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.    But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to thecontribution of the new Atlantic City facility.    Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's thirdquarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.    Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the AtlanticCity hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interestexpenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facilitydirectly against income rather than capitalizing the interestas it had been able to do previously.    Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter andgaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gamingwas completed earlier in the week. Reuter
SECURITY PACIFIC <SPC> LOANS PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL Security Pacific Corp said it isplacing medium and long-term loans to Brazil and Ecuador on anon-accrual basis as of March 31, a move that will reduce firstquarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, aftertaxes.    Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings,Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarterearnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per sharereported for the first quarter of 1986.    The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mlndlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrsof medium- and long-term debt on February 20.    Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billiondlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks sinceFebruary.    In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest paymentsfor the rest of the year because of an earthquake which haltedthe export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct thecountry's export revenues.    In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will recordinterest income only as it is received in cash.    The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach anagreement with its banks and that interest payments will resumelater in 1987.    The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New Yorkwhen Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to askbanks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of termdebt that matures on April 15.

In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest PipelineCorp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that areamong the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gasreserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feetin 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.    The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which hasless take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, shouldshow improvement in its 1987 operating results because ofchanges tariff and federal tax rates.    The company's gas marketing business is expected to havesomewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in itsoperating region, the annual report said. The gas marketingunit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.    Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in itsdebt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mlndlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co andproceeds from the sale and leaseback of WilliamsTelecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will notbe profitable until late 1988, Williams said. Reuter

HAWKEYE <HWKB> 1986 ANNUAL REPORT QUALIFIED Hawkeye Bancorp's 1986 annualfinancial results were qualified by its auditors, according tothe annual report.    "...there are conditions which may indicate that thecompany will be unable to continue as a going concern,"auditors Deloitte Haskins and Sells said in Hawkeye's annualreport to shareholders.    Hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citingan increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs andrestructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs.    However, Hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986year end, said it expects "to have sufficient cash to meet itsobligations for the next 12-month period."    Last July the bank holding company reached a debtrestructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiariesand five non-bank operations for disposition.    "The restructuring has improved Hawkeye's financialcondition, but it does not assure that Hawkeye will be able tosurvive as a going concern," the report said.    Hawkeye's survival will depend on its ability to complywith provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatoryagreements and on its ability to return to profitableoperations, it said.    There can be no assurance that Hawkeye will be able to meetthese requirements. However, the company "believes it will beable to do so," Hawkeye said. Reuter

Burmah Oil 1986 pre-tax profit 105.9 mln stg vs 7 Remarks by two leading central bankerssparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut inthe West German three pct discount rate may be underdiscussion, currency dealers said.    Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech thatmonetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflowsrequired cuts in interest rates.    Separately, West Berlin state central bank president DieterHiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall belowits lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he wasnot making a forecast on interest rates, however.    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollargained slight background support from the speculation.    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the moneymarket this week, dashing some expectations that it may eitheroffer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rateand let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much lessthan the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pactexpired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank couldmove to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.    Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculativecapital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless ofwhether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity."    Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of thegenerally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked thefirst time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as acounterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.REUTER^M

PHILIPPINE TELEPHONE FIRM PLANS STOCK SPLIT The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co<PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pctstock dividend later this year to reduce excess marketbuoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters.    Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of thecompany's common stock from 10 to five pesos.    He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 151987. "The exercise should make our stock more marketable," Lazosaid. "Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors."    PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the ManilaStock Exchange.    Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15,would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.    PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of sixbillion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.    At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.    A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely tobe substantial since the government raised its franchise tax tothree pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income taxfrom which it was previously exempt.    The government has not so far ordered the implementation ofthe tax decision.    PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in thePhilippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instrumentsin the country.

CCF REPORTS 34.8 PCT PROFIT BOOST, SHARE SPLIT SEEN Credit Commercial de France <CCFP.PA>reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mlnfrancs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before itsdenationalisation around the end of this month.    Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest interms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offerahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital tothe public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.    Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it wasnationalised by the Socialists in 1982.    The sources said it was too early to give details of theplanned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as alikely date for the flotation launch.    So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale tolarge private investors to constitute a solid core of eight toten shareholders before the flotation.    The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mlnfranc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday."The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,"CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.    Market sources put the total value of CCF's privatisationat between four and five billion francs.

The company said guilder revenue and profit were pressuredby falls in exchange rates, particularly in the US andAustralian dollar and sterling.    Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would havebeen 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher,NatNed said.    The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986compared with 52 pct in 1985.    The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mlnguilders after 428.4 mln in 1985 due to currency influences,tighter interest margins and increased investment.    Claim payouts fell to 9.9 mln guilders after 66.6 mln theprevious year.    The company's total assets reached 69.87 billion guildersin 1986 against 67 billion the year before.

AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS Dutch insurer AEGON NV <AEGN.AS>reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mlnguilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profitsfor 1987.    Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billionguilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said itsrevenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and achange in accounting practice. It added that revenues wouldhave risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainlydue to its life insurance business.    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rosedespite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums andhigher personal risks.    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damageinsurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health andlife insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a changein accounting for U.S. Annuities.    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personalinvestment influences that it should be accounted differentlyfrom the more traditional insurances.    This change in accounting practice and another change toaccount for profits made on fixed interest investments,resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mlnguilders.    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profitswere slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initialcosts for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in TheHague.    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emergedin the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initialcosts for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON inMay 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by thesecosts and made only a small contribution to the group'sprofits.    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwillfor Monumental Corp.    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.  REUTER

ABBOTT LABORATORIES 1ST QTR NET SHR 62 CTS V India's national foodgrain target hasbeen fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchangedfrom the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in itsannual report for 1986/87.    Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterologicalsub-divisions of the country.    The report gave the targets for various crops withestimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grainsincluding sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).    Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it waspossible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifyinggrowing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.    The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along withgreater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement infertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, addingtotal foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4mln.   India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnesof foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-yeardevelopment plan ending March 31, 1990.    Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gapof 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining threeyears of the plan by increasing grain output annually by morethan nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only withgood weather, the report said.    "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water(irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread ofimproved technology including timely use of inputs (farmmaterials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to bevigrously pursued," it said. Reuter
REICHHOLD CHEMICAL <RCI> SETS ANTI-TAKEOVER PLAN Reichhold Chemical Inc said itsboard adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferredstock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on eachcommon share outstanding.    The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed toprotect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attemptsto aquire control without making an adequate offer for allshares.    Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to anyspecific takeover attempt.    Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buyone one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series ofpreferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, withdividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of oneshare of the company's common stock.    The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold'sprior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more ofthe voting power or announces a tender offer which would resultin 20 pct ownership, the company said.    Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at fivects apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, orbefore an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional twopct or more of the voting power of the company, or inconnection with certain transactions afterward.    The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1,1987, and will expire 10 years later, the company said.    Details of the plan are outlined in a letter to be mailedto stockholders. Reuter

VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES Losses for Volkswagen AG<VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud willnot exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VWspokesman said.    The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed itwould pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on1986 business, despite the provision.    One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currencydealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses fromthe currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, butthe VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit."    VW said in a statement following today's supervisory boardmeeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal indetail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreigncurrency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditingcompany.    VW has said computer programs were erased and documentswere faked in the alleged fraud in which it believestransactions intended to protect it against possible foreigncurrency losses were not completed.    VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger wasarrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of havingevaded justice.    Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks andparent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommendan unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company hasalso set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,which were issued last year. Analysts have described the helddividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.    VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5billion marks, with the result that its total dividend paymenton 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,since the new capital was in preference shares.    The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves inorder to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. Atthe end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightlyless than three billion marks. REUTER

WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORP 1ST QTR SHR 1.05 DLRS V The United States' dependency onforeign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum IndustryResearch Associates.    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conferencehere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as muchas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous highlevel of 47 pct in 1977.    "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil isinevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oilimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to40 pct by 1990.    "However, the rate of this growth can be affectedpositively or negatively through government action orinaction," Lichtblau said.    He said that one of the government's negative actions isthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cashflow for oil exploration.    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floorprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.    "An international floor price adopted by all or mostindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effectivemeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than ifwe imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.    Development of alternate energy sources such as syntheticfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessenU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.    A potential for alternative supplies could limit thewillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offertax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the StrategicPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plansfor alternative energy.

MOORE <MCL> SEES SUBSTANTIAL 1987 PROFIT GAIN Moore Corp Ltd expects 1987 profits fromcontinuing operations will exceed 1986 results and recover to1985 levels when the company earned 152 mln U.S. dlrs or 1.70dlrs a share, president M. Keith Goodrich said.    "We'll have a substantial increase in earnings fromcontinuing operations," he told reporters after the annualmeeting. He said he expected profits would recover last year'slost ground and reach 1985 results.    In 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to139.5 mln dlrs or 1.54 dlrs a share. The total excluded lossesof 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations.    Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking foracquisitions related to its core areas of business formsmanufacturing or handling.    "We could do a large acquisition," he said when asked ifthe company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for thispurpose.    Chairman Judson Sinclair, answering a shareholder'squestion, told the annual meeting that a special resolutionpassed by shareholders to create a new class of preferredshares would allow Moore to move quickly if it decided topursue an acquisition.    "If we were to make a major acquisition ... it means we canmove with a certain expediency," Sinclair said.    Asked if the resolution was designed to give Mooreprotection from a possible hostile takeover, Sinclair saidonly, "I know of no threat to the corporation at this time."         Reuter

TEXACO SEES BUSINESS LITTLE HIT BY BANKRUPTCY MOVE Texaco Inc <TX> said its decision tofile for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcycode will not affect the majority of its businesses.    It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,plant and equipment, were free of the action.    Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operatingsubsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, areaffected, it said.    But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 centsper share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repaymentson debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.    Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers weredemanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as aresult of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.    Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bondof more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp <GTY>. The bond almostmatches the damages awarded against Texaco.    Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could beginto attach its assets to secure the judgment.    Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cutTexaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back tothe Texas courts.    Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze allTexaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits ofthe Pennzoil lawsuit.    "Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bondissue and the larger dispute failed," James Kinnear, Texaco'spresident and chief executive officer, told reporters.    Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers onFriday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing untilthe end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.    Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cashbond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct ofearnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would notsell any assets, Kinnear said.    Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter ofcredit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under11.1 billion dlrs, he added.    Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said thecompany had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco onSaturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed forbankruptcy.    He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing aconfidentiality agreement between the two companies. "Texacotold us they would get back to us but instead they chose to goto bankruptcy court," Jamail said.    Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company wouldprevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets wereample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full. REUTER

IRVING BANK CORP 1ST QTR SHR 1.51 DLRS VS 1 Saudi Arabia has speeded up reform ofits financial system with a package of measures designed toboost the economy and open up the Kingdom to the lucrativeworld of investment banking.    Bankers in Saudi Arabia detect a fundamental shift inpolicy stemming from a need to tackle the underlyingcontradiction between an Islamic legal framework and westernbanking system.    One senior banker in Jeddah said: "There is a new windblowing... Saudi Arabia is moving on many fronts in a mannerthat is extraordinarily aggressive."    The speed of reform, begun last year but now gatheringpace, has surprised bankers who have had to contend with afinancial system that restricted internationalisation of theriyal and a religious court system that made debt collectingdifficult.    Saudi banks, once the most profitable in the world, havegenerally reported falling profits for 1986 -- the fourthsuccessive year of decline -- as loan loss provisions ate intoalready dwindling earnings.    Bankers say the Saudi Finance Ministry and Saudi ArabianMonetary Agency (SAMA) seem to have developed a new strategyalthough it remains to be seen how it will be implemented.    Reform started in 1986 with measures to boost previouslydormant stock trading, but took off in earnest this year.    -- From January 1, SAMA liberalised the money market,giving banks greater access to liquidity aid via repurchaseagreements.    -- From March 22, the Finance Ministry abolishedwithholding tax on funds borrowed by Saudi banks abroad.    -- From the same date, banks were notified of a newcommittee to be set up under the auspices of SAMA to hear bankdisputes with creditors over non-payment of loans.    -- Also from the same date, banks were allowed to usemortgages as collateral for lending, banned since 1981.    -- Within a few weeks, the Kingdom's first stock markettrading floor is expected to be opened.    Housed in central Riyadh in the building of the SaudiIndustrial Development Fund, the floor will initially be usedto trade shares on an auction system. Staff from each of the 11commercial banks have been trained ahead of the launch and anew computer network has been set up.    One banker said: "The abolition of withholding tax will givebanks the opportunity to participate in new instruments such asinterest rate or currency swaps. At last SAMA and the FinanceMinistry are opening up markets for investment banking."    Bankers say Saudi authorities appear to have been shockedinto reform by pressure from banks and alarm at bank reluctanceto extend further loans to the private sector.    Banks have lobbied hard for change, arguing that thereligious, or Sharia, legal framework was inconsistent with theKingdom's western banking system and made it nigh impossiblefor them to collect interest on bad loans through the courts.    As a result, many banks had virtually stopped new lending,but found themselves cut off from world investment banking by aseries of restrictions. Withholding tax made it punitivelyexpensive to take part in interest rate or currency swaps.    The private sector's frustration at the virtual standstillin bank lending overflowed at a businessmen's conference in themountain resort in Abha last month and some powerful merchantfamilies also called for change, bankers said.    "Banks lobbied hard and had the ultimate weapon to forcechange -- they stopped lending," another banker said. "That wasstifling growth of the economy."    It is still unclear whether the new committee that will beset up to hear bank disputes with creditors will prove any moreefficient than another non-Sharia system already in force, theCommittees for the Settlement of Commercial Disputes (CSCDs).    Some bankers believe the new committee, yet to be formed,will simply delay pending cases and force banks into a seriesof private deals with creditors.    Nor is it clear what stance the new committee will take oninterest payments, generally not recognised under Islamic law.    But other bankers say the move is clear recognition by SAMAand the Finance Ministry that Sharia courts and the CSCDs werenot the correct bodies for hearing bank disputes.    Other reforms have been taken or are in the pipeline.Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail said in March that anew body would examine late government payments to contractors.    In addition, further moves are under way to align businesslife to the Gregorian calendar year, with companies being urgedto adopt it as their financial year.    A black list of borrowers, started more than two years agoby banks, has recently been effectively sanctioned by SAMA,bankers say.    Banks are now not permitted to lend or engage in securitiestransactions with any party on the list. REUTER

IRVING BANK <V> CITES LOANS IN EARNING DECLINE Irving Bank Corp said the decline inits first quarter earnings to 28.6 mln dlrs from 30.4 mln dlrsin the year-ago period were due to the placement on anon-accrual basis of 215 mln dlrs and 33 mln dlrs of medium andlong-term loans to borrowers in Brazil and Equador.

FOSTER <FWC> UNIT AUDIT REVEALS DISCREPANCIES Foster Wheeler Corp <FWC> said anaudit of its Stearns Airport Equiment Co Inc unit, revealed"substantial discrepancies" in Stearns accounts that mayrequire material adjustments to previously announceconsolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries.    Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior managementmade Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they wereby improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's presidentand controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did notknow the names of the president and controller, and could notimmediately comment on the release.    Foster said the amount involved in the "discrepancy" isabout 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs netafter tax due to an "improper recording of job costs over aperiod of several years and continuing through part of thefirst quarter of 1987."    Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not"likely to be significant" but the amount to be charged toprior periods had not been determined.    Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mlndlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.

CHEMICAL <CHL> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, EXPENSES Chemical New York Corp said itsfirst-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.    Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mlndlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring theBrazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs inlost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.    A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrsfrom 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise wasmainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth inconsumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.    Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs ofmedium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are notresumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for thewhole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.    Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador onnon-accrual because the Quito government also suspendedinterest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interestincome by 1.5 mln dlrs.    Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrsfrom 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from3.96 pct.    This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, areduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculationof the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) anda narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical'scost of funds.    Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrsfrom 26.2 mln.    Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said.    The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, comparedwith 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs atquarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.    Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billiondlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end ofMarch, 1986. Reuter

NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK USA 1ST-QTR NET RISES National Westminster Bank USA saidhigher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantialincrease in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise infirst-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reporteda year earlier.    The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction ofincome as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.    Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly tomiddle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But someof these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.    Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losseswas 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.    Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at theend of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrsof loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.    The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual forthe remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reducedby about 4.9 mln dlrs.

TALKING POINT/IBM <IBM> International Business Machines Corphas started the year aggressively, but industry analysts saidthe company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stopa two-year earnings slump.    "I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than Ihave been in a long time," said PaineWebber analyst StephenSmith.    "But they're not out of the woods yet," he added.    At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easilytopped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from aneven dollar to 1.20 dlrs.    Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM'sperformance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a fullrecovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not befelt until later in the year.    These include the success of IBM's new personal computerline, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,which will begin volume shipments in July.    In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of itsearly-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves willemerge as the year progresses.    Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers wasrelatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook thanhe has been for nearly a year.    "Although the worldwide economic situation remainsunsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,"Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higherfirst-quarter shipments. "We remain optimistic about theprospects for both the industry and IBM," he said.    "Akers was most encouraging," said PaineWebber's Smith.    A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframecomputer sales all contributed to the better-than-expectedfirst-quarter results, analysts said.    "Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong inMarch," after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil ofWashington-based Weil and Associates.    Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly calledthe Sierras, "bailed out the whole quarter," Weil said, adding,"If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year."REUTER...^M

IRVING BANK <V> 1ST-QTR NET HURT BY BRAZIL Irving Bank Corp said a six pct dropin first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely theresult of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers inBrazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.    Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrsfrom 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per sharedropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.    Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs ofEcuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter netincome by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.    Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mlndlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received onthese loans during the remainder of 1987.    Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on thetrading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,although these were partly offset by increased trust income,profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securitiesgains, the bank said.    The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986. Reuter

GTE <GTE> CITES LOSS OF SPRINT GTE Corp said the decline in itsfirst quarter net income reflects a 121 mln dlr loss from its50 pct share ownership of U.S. Sprint's operations.    This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reportedon operations GTE owned a year ago quarter and prior toentering a joint venture with United Telecommunications <UT> inJuly 1986. Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct ofSprint.    Earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0mln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago.    Theodore Brophy, chairman of GTE said, "we expect USSprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer trafficmigrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distancetelecommunications.    The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices aswell as higher operating costs related, in part, to thefraudalent use of the network.    Operating income of its telephone operations, which accountfor 91 pct of the total, rose eight pct to 736.0 mln dlrs. Revenues from telephone operations rose eight pct to 2.9billion dlrs. Reuter
GOODYEAR <GT> TO SELL CELERON Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said itexpects to sell its Celeron Corp oil and gas subsidiary forabout two billion dlrs in about two months.

In thesame year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents ashare from continuing operations.    Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buyingCeleron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit.    Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almostcomplete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara,Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserveswould not be sold separately from the pipeline.    Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag forCeleron was too high, Mercer said "There is no fire sale goingon here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitableoperation throughout the year."    Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit wasbased on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchaselast year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeoverbid. Reuter

"I think (debt) forgiveness will simply create anenvironment in which no more money will go into development anda lot of the world will be consigned to poverty and toinstability indefinitely," he told ABC Television on Sunday.    A number of bills have been introduced in Congress thatwould require commercial banks to forgive a least a portion ofthe debt owed them by cash-starved developing countries.    "I think we've got to find ways of encouraging continuousimprovement in policies, of wise use of money in short, ratherthan trying to turn everybody off," Conable said.    Conable told ABC's "Business World" he supported TreasurySecretary James Baker's debt plan as an "andidote to debt."

Better operating results in each of the company's three sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter dueto financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace andthe sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profitwith Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said.    "Our first quarter results show clear benefits of ourrestructuring," chairman Edson Spencer said. "All of ourbusinesses are producing better results than last year, eventhough we do not see significant improvement in the externalmarket environment," he said.    Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders inaddition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said.    Domestic industrial automation and control orders weremodestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.    Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation andcontrol business were flat in the U.S. and up in internationalmarkets, it said.    International orders increased, with the greatest strengthin Europe, Honeywell said.    The company said that by year-end 1987, it intends tocomplete the repurchase of 3.3 mln shares remaining of a fivemln share buyback program which began in 1986. Reuter

INTERFIRST CORP 1ST QTR LOSS 28 CTS VS PROFIT T OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutinyin coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies ofoil to international oil markets, the Kuwait daily al-Qabassaid.    In an article headlined, "Gulf oil sources say Middle Eastproduction up 1.4 mln bpd," it warned OPEC's official pricescould face fresh pressure from international oil companiesseeking cheaper supplies.    It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and otherproducers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nordid it specify if the sources were official or other contacts.    "The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come underfresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in theEuropean and American markets," the daily said.    The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had inMarch demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, somemembers had raised output last week. It gave no details.    "Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec wasable to control production, or whether the days of cheating andproducing over quotas has begun anew," it said.    The sources warned that "maybe the (price of a) barrel ofoil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next ifthere is no control on supplies," it said.    "The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrelmay open the doors for international oil companies to pressureOPEC over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,"it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to liftfrom Qatar unless it gave price discounts.    "More than one official has warned OPEC would find itssolidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,"it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer. Reuter

MARINE MIDLAND BANKS INC 1ST QTR 1.74 DLRS VS 1 American Century Corp said ithas restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30,1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan lossallowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000dlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs.    The company said the change came after talks with theSecurities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgementin considering the five mln dlrs collectible.    In the note to its 1986 financial statement, AmericanCentury said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,making its loan loss provision less than required.    The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it stillfeels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986was adequate and that it has considered all relevantinformation to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlrreceivable.    But, it said continued disagreement with the SEC staffwould not be in its best interest. Reuter

DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE FALLS 50 U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oilplatform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided asecond oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missileattack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.    President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinbergerwarned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the militaryescalation between the two countries continued in the volatilewaterway.    Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform byfour U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shellsat the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the centralGulf.    A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranianoil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radarand communications equipment before leaving the structure, thePentagon said.     Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reportersthat the second platform had been abandoned by Iranianpersonnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.    The United States said both platforms were being used tokeep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboatattacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards. Reuter
