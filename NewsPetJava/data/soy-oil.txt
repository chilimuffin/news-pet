FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT The sharp decline in soybean crush ratiosseen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, haspushed margins below the cost of production at most soybeanprocessing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybeanmeal and oil.    The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by theNational Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen overthe past two months when crush margins surged to the bestlevels seen in over a year.    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushedsoybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in theweekly crush number.    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surgein shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the nextfew months.    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feeddemand is very light for this time of year due to the milderthan normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices inan attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recentweeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in thenearby March contract today.    "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and soldMay, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crushtrader said.    "But they've been bailing out this week because the Marchhas been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if nottomorrow, then later in the month," he added.    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crushratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents perbushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last twodays.    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so noprocessors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitablelevel, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cutback production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.    With futures down, processors are finding they must bidpremiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 centsfor every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, downsharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and belowthe average cost of production, cash dealers said.    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, withlittle talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. Butprocessors will start halting production in the next few weeksit they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added. Reuter

YEUTTER BLASTS PROPOSED EC OILS AND FATS TAX U.S. trade representative ClaytonYeutter today said that if the European Community's Council ofMinisters approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, anothermajor transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture.    In a statement issued by the trade representative's officefollowing a speech to the American Soybean Association's boardof directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severeimpact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billiondlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.    "This is an unacceptable situation for us and its(vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but tovigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access tothe European market," Yeutter said.    Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violateEC obligations under the GATT.    He said the effect of the tax would be to double the priceof soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarinemade from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine,and closer in price to expensive European butter.    "I am astonished that the EC commission would propose sucha provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolvedthe agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC toinclude Spain and Portugal," Yeutter said.    "It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontationalcourse before the recent wounds have healed and as we arebeginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of globaltrade talks)," he said.

Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and salesto unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.    Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half fromthe previous week's combined sales, it said.    Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers fordelivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1.    Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled thepreceding week, but were nearly a third below the four weekaverage. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexicoand Italy, it said.    Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct lessthan the four week average.    Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy andAustralia were partially offset by declines to unknowndestinations.    Soybean oil sales of 5,400 tonnes were the result ofincreases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes forunknown destinations.    Combined sales activity in cotton of 75,200 running bales-- 44,700 bales for the current year and 30,500 bales for the1987/88  bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's goodshowing, the department said.

EC FARM LOBBIES BACK OILS AND FATS "TAX" PLAN The European Community (EC) farmers'and farm cooperatives lobbies, Copa and Cogeca, have backed theEC Commission plan for an oils and fats price stabilisationmechanism, claiming it would not harm consumers.    In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans,current president of the EC Council of Ministers, they said themechanism, often referred to as a tax, would in fact subsidiseoils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances.    This would have been the case in May 1984, when soya oilprices cif Rotterdam stood at 914 dlrs a tonne, they noted.    If such price stabilisation is not implemented, EC farmersshould not be the ones to suffer through their prices andincomes from the financial consequences, the letter, madeavailable to journalists, said.    Under the Commission proposal the mechanism would initiallyresult in a tax of 330 Ecus a tonne on both imported and ECproduced oils and marine fats.    The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced, andpossibly to become a subsidy, as world soya oil prices rosefrom present levels. REUTER

MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET Malaysia is unlikely to meet itstargeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.    Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliserand overstressed palms, they said.    The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil Worldnewsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely todrop sharply this year.    Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell morepalm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage theindustry, a leading grower told Reuters.    The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnesagainst about 800,000 last March, the growers said.    The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this yeardue to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.    The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.    In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expectedto enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oiloutput peaks.    They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new treesagainst 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reductionwill not be felt for about another three years.

JAPAN SEES MARGINAL RISE IN EDIBLE OIL DEMAND The Agriculture Ministry estimatesJapan's edible oil demand will rise 1.5 pct in calendar 1987 to1.68 mln tonnes from 1.65 mln in 1986.    Domestic consumption will rise to 1.66 mln tonnes in 1987from 1.64 mln in 1986, while imports will rise to 77,000 tonnesfrom 70,000 and exports will be unchanged at 14,000.    Edible oil supplies will total 1.75 mln tonnes in 1987against 1.73 mln last year, including domestic output of 1.60mln against 1.55 mln. Domestic supplies will comprise 725,000of soybean oil (706,000 in 1986), 638,000 of rapeseed oil(609,000) and 235,000 of other origin oils (231,000). REUTER
GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE The rate of increase in world palm oiluse is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that inthe next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year averageincrease of 550,000 tonnes.     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expectedto be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlierlevels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnesabove this season's available amount, Mielke said.    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia willslow down from this year on, but that will be offset by areaexpansion in Indonesia, he said.    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesianmature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, andat 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,but where yields are lower, he said.     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is alsoexpected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel andpalm.    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils wereunusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the currentseason's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year agoand with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the startof next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks bythe end of next season.    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks lastOctober and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 atthe end of next season, Mielke said.    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in thecourse of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen insoybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mlntonnes or by one fifth.    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mlntonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocksof 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of thisseason.
