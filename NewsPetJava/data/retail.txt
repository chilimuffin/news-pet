FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN U.S. retailers posted stronger thanexpected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analyststo change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for thefirst half of 1987.     "My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of thebusiness we normally see later in the quarter and the realstrength of general merchandise sales will be in the secondhalf of 1987," said Bear Stearns and Co analyst MonroeGreenstein.    "I don't think March will be as strong because Easter fallsin April this year," said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb.   Analysts generally average the sales results of March andApril to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence.    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates saidsales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a3.6 pct increase last year.     Analysts noted that February is considered a small,transitory month between winter and spring.    In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by anespecially soft February last year which was adversely affectedby severe weather.    Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales,according to retailers and analysts.    "February's strong sales reflected a lot of freshmerchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due totax reductions," said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.    Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales ofdurable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuinghigh levels of consumer debt.     May Department Stores Co <MAY> and K Mart Corp <KM> wereamong the strong performers, posting comparable store salesgains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overallsales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain last month.    "Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programscontinued to positively impact our sales comparisons. INaddition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all ourspecialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,"said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.    Sears Roebuck and Co <S> posted a 4.9 pct increase."Domestic sales were led by better than average increases inapparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strongcatalog sales," said Sears chairman Edward Brennan.    Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc<JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early inthe month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitivestore basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales.    Penney chairman William Howell said, "store sales werestrongest during the early part of the month, while catalogdemand was consistently strong throughout the period.    Store sales activity varied throughout the country, rangingfrom good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest.    Analysts also said gross profit margins were high asretailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventoriesthan a year ago.    "February is not a big month seasonally but these numberssuggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending," said DrexelBurnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

N.Z. DECEMBER QUARTER RETAIL SALES FALL 13.2 PCT Retail sales in the quarter endedDecember 31 fell a seasonally adjusted 13.2 pct compared with a7.8 pct rise in the September quarter and a 1.3 pct fall a yearago period, the Statistics Department said.    Actual retail sales in the December quarter totalled 6.17billion N.Z. Dlrs compared with 6.70 billion in the previousquarter and 6.10 billion a year ago period.

FEBRUARY U.S. JOBS GAINS SHOW STRONGER ECONOMY Momentum in th U.S. economy may bepicking up given solid across-the board increases in theFebruary U.S. employment report, economists said.    U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February,twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previouslyreported 448,000 increase.    "Even if you look at January and February together, this isstill a much stronger report than the consensus expectation inthe market," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.    Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal muchlarger gains in February U.S. production and income thanpreviously forecast.    The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week sinceNovember 1966, the Commerce Department said.    "The gains in manufacturing employment point to a verylarge increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7pct," said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Incnoted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hourin February from 8.83 dlrs in January.    "Combined with the increase in hours worked, this meanswe'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-visthe wage and salary disbursement," he said.    Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income shouldrise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.    He said the February employment gains are consistent withhis firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national productgrowth forecast of 3.7 pct.    Economists agreed that the employment data were negativefor the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economyand no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Butmost said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.    "This report is another reason for the Fed to not considereasing," said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.    "It gives them more room to address the dollar situation," hesaid. "If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,but it's most likely they'll sit and wait."    "The data have not been uniform," Stone added. "Durablegoods were weak in January and now employment is strong."    In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gapwidened to 14.8 billion dlrs.    "Things just aren't adding up," said Steve Slifer of LehmanGoverment Securities Inc. "Consumer spending, capital spending,goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak firstquarter GNP growth of one pct," he said.    "The employment and production data point to a biginventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourthquarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth."    Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain wasaccounted for by striking workers in the steel and machineryindustries returning to work.    Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gainshave resulted from an improving trade outlook.    Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exportsgrew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase inimports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improvein the first quarter.    "Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paperproducts, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods showthat trade is improving," Benderley said.    "The economy is moving between extremes," he said. "Somereports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarterGNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct."    A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greaterpart of February's employment gain. Retail services employmentrose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 inJanuary, previously reported at 166,000.    Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. Butthis follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised downfrom a previously reported 142,000 gain.    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged inFebruary at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading sinceMarch 1980, the Commerce Department noted.    "The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,"Carson said. "This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that."       Reuter
U.S. ECONOMIC DATA KEY TO DEBT FUTURES OUTLOOK U.S. economic data this week could bethe key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures breakout of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.    Although market expectations are for February U.S. retailsales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthygains, figures within or slightly below expectations would bepositive for the market, the analysts said.    "You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bondsright now," said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst CraigSloane.    Treasury bond futures came under pressure today whichtraders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and arise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interestto break below chart support in the June contract failed tomaterialize, participants who had sold bond futures earlyquickly covered short positions, they said.    "Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come inas expected it won't be that bad for the market," Sloane said.    Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sectorof retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.    Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figurebelow market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, andshe put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up0.8 to 1.2 pct.    Industrial production and the producer price index Fridayboth are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, sheadded.    Retail sales "will tell us whether or not we will be ableto fill the gap," Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in Junebonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bondsclosed at 100-4/32 today.    Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to thefederal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, saidCarroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.    "A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded themarket from breaking out of the trading range the last time themarket approached the top of the range," Singer said.    In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,which is just below 102 in the June contract, "the crude oilrally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,"Singer said. "Fed funds are already easing back down toward thesix pct level."    The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern toManufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rallymay be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.    Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract toease to 99-6/32 and find support.    "I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.The jury is still out this week," Rozich said.

U.S. RETAIL SALES ROSE 4.1 PCT IN FEB, NON-AUTO SALES ROSE An 18-month strike againstWatsonville Canning and Frozen Foods, one of California'slargest food processors, ended with workers overwhelminglyratifying a new contract.    More than 1,000 workers walked off their jobs in September1985 after Watsonville Canning cut their wages from 6.66 dlrsan hour to 4.85 dlrs.    Watsonville declared bankruptcy last week and the cannerywas taken over by Norcal Frozen Foods Inc., a consortium ofgrowers. A spokeswoman for Teamsters Local 912 said the workersvoted 543-21 in favor of a new contract.    The Norcal offer provides a 5.85 dlrs-per-hour wage with noadditional benefits for most workers for up to three years. Reuter
U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE 4.1 PCT IN FEBRUARY U.S. retail sales rose 4.77 billiondlrs, or 4.1 pct, in February to a seasonally adjusted 122.29billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.    The increase came after a revised 7.4 pct drop in Januarysales to a level of 117.52 billion dlrs. The departmentpreviously reported January retail sales fell 5.8 pct.    Excluding autos, retail sales in February were up 1.5 pctafter falling by a revised 0.4 pct in January.    Department spokesmen said the major cause for the revisiondownward in January sales was a weaker January auto dealersales figure than originally estimated.    Auto dealer sales were 26.91 billion dlrs in February, a14.4 pct rise from January levels. But January sales dropped by27.7 pct from December levels to 23.52 billion dlrs, more thanthe 22.4 pct fall originally reported.    The expiration of the sales tax deduction under new taxlaws on January 1 was the main reason for the drop in Januarysales, department spokesmen said.    Sales of durable goods rose in February by 8.8 pct to 46.72billion dlrs after dropping by 17.7 pct in January.    Building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after fallingby 1.7 pct in January.    Non-durable goods sales rose by 1.3 pct to 75.58 billiondlrs in February after falling by 0.2 pct in January, thedepartment said.

U.K. RETAILERS SEE GROWTH IN CONSUMER SPENDING U.K. Retailers expect consumer spendingto accelerate in March after a disappointing increase inFebruary, according to a monthly survey by the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI).    Fifty-nine pct of the 325 retailers questioned for thelatest Distributive Trades Survey expected sales to be higherin March than they were in March 1986, with only six pctexpecting lower sales.    The chairman of the Distributive Trades Survey Panel, NigelWhittaker, said a favourable Budget next week would furtherhelp sales during the summer.    Figures released earlier this week showed retail sales inJanuary fell 2.2 pct, mainly due to exceptionally cold weather.    "Sales did not recover in February as much as retailers hadexpected, and they are now looking for better business inMarch," today's survey said.    It reported clothing stores were the most optimistic, with80 pct expecting sales in March to be higher than a year ago.    Wholesalers also expected stronger sales in March, whileboth retailers and wholesalers reported slower growth in importpenetration, it said. REUTER

U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND - ANALYSTS U.S. retail sales rose sharply inFebruary but many economists said the underlying consumerspending trend remains weak.    February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January'ssales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previouslyreported 5.8 pct decline.    "The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at amuch more sluggish pace," said Don Maude of Midland MontaguCapital Markets Inc.    Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales dataover past four months to show that the pace of consumerspending is slowing.    Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in Novemberand a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gainover the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4pct rise for year-over-year sales through February.    "You can see a pattern developing," Maude said. "I wouldn'tbe surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since salesprobably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were inFebruary."    Despite the weak underlying trend, economists wereimpressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excludingautos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct declinein January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline.    "The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gainsin durable goods as well as non-durables," noted Ward McCarthyof Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. "It was a pretty healthyreport."    He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in Februaryafter falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise storesales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January.    "There are signs of life in the economy," McCarthy said."But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this reportinto the future."     A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in Januarywhich may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boostspending in February, he said.    "A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholdingtaxes from their paychecks," he said. "When people in thiscountry get an increase in disposable income, the inclinationis to go out and spend it," he said.    Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales forthe first 10 days of March will be an important indicator ofhow much this sector will add to first quarter spending.     Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of totalFebruary sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct dropin January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largelyto the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax lawsJanuary 1, the Commerce Department noted.    Some economists argued that the because the gain in totalsales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, thestrength in the February report is less than impressive.    "There is strength in the February data, but that's becausethey were compared to low sales levels in January," said saidBeth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "We don't see it as aprecursor of continued strength."    Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January.    Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higheroil prices rather than an increased volume of gas salesprobably accounted for these gains.    Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spendingis weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billiondlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, theyfell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and inFebruary rose to 122.29 billion dlrs.    "On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mlndlrs in the first quartrer," she said. "We don't look at thisas indication that the economy is barrelling along."    "The number is not really that problematic for those of uswho are constructive on the bond market," agreed Elliot Plattof Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.    Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetarypolicy on the basis of the latest retail sales report.    "The Fed is on hold now because the data have been soconfusing," he said.    "Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payrollemployment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut inMarch," he said. "But now Fed officials will have to wait forthe first quarter real U.S. gross national product data inApril to sort things out." Reuter
UK FEB RETAIL SALES RISE PROVISIONAL 2.2 PCT (JAN FALL 2.2 PCT) -  Gold is expected to continue its risethis year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially inthe U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.    It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oilprices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries'efforts to achieve further firming of the price led to growinginflationary pressures in the U.S., The world's biggest crudeoil producer.    Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceedthe central banks' limits and real growth of their grossnational products, it said.    Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increasedindustrial demand and higher expected coin production, the banksaid.    Speculative demand, which influences the gold price onfutures markets, has also risen. These factors and SouthAfrica's unstable political situation, which may lead to atemporary reduction in gold supplies from that country,underline the firmer sentiment, it said.    However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986. REUTER

FRENCH GDP SHOULD RISE 2.3 PCT IN 1988 - MINISTRY French gross domestic product should growby 2.3 pct in 1988 after two pct growth this year and 2.1 pctin 1986, the Finance Ministry said.    The latest forecast, prepared by the National Accounts andBudget Commission, assumed an exchange rate of 6.20 francs tothe dollar this year and next and an average oil import pricerising to 18.9 dlrs a barrel next year from 17.4 dlrs this yearand 14.7 in 1986.    The Commission, headed by Finance minister EdouardBalladur, forecast a fall in consumer price inflation to twopct year-on-year at end-1988 from 2.4 pct at end 1987 and 2.1pct last year.    In annual average terms inflation would fall to two pct in1988 from 2.5 pct this year and 2.7 pct last year, it said.    Trade should show a one billion franc annual surplus thisyear and next after last year's 0.5 billion surplus, it added.    Employment should rise by 0.1 pct a year over the next twoyears while the state budget deficit should be cut to 2.2 pctof GDP in 1988 from 2.6 pct this year and 2.9 pct in 1986.    Other forecasts prepared by the Commission indicated a 1.8pct 1988 rise in household purchasing power, up from 1.1 pctthis year but less than last year's 2.9 pct, and a 1.6 pct risein household consumption, compared with this year's 1.5 pct andlast year's 2.9 pct.

Excluding defense, orders rose 3.8 pct, compared with arevised January decline of 7.7 pct.    In January, durable goods fell a revised 9.9 pct instead ofthe previously reported 7.5 pct. Durables excluding defensewere reported originally as having fallen 9.9 pct in January.    The Commerce Department on Monday revised orders statisticsfor 1982 to 1986 to reflect more current inventory valuationmethods, and the February orders statistics are consistent withthe revisions, officials said.    The February order increase was led by transportationequipment, up 11.1 pct after an 18.0 pct decline in January.    Orders for defense capital goods rose 48.9 pct to 6.9billion dlrs, following a 38.8 pct decline in January.    Non-defense capital goods orders fell 1.6 pct in Februaryto 26.3 billion dlrs after falling 8.7 pct in January, thedepartment said.    Electrical machinery orders rose in February by 8.2 pct to17.2 billion dlrs after falling 15.4 pct in January.    Primary metals orders were up 13.9 pct to 8.4 billion dlrsafter a 20 pct decline in January, the department said.    New orders for non-electrical machinery were up in Februaryby 3.9 pct to 16.6 billion dlrs after a three pct ordersdecline in January. Reuter
U.S. ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH The U.S. economy is showing somepromising signs of accelerated expansion despite thesluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, privateeconomists say.    Some of the slowness experienced in the October-Decemberperiod had been expected to spill over into the first quarterthis year, as the tax law changes that went into effect inJanuary slowed business and consumer spending.    But some of the latest economic data show signs ofsurprising strength in the U.S. economy, although someeconomists remain cautious about the outlook.    The Commerce Department reported today that new orders fordurable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pctrise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defensegoods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agencysaid.    The February numbers surpassed the expectations of manyfinancial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat toincreases of up to five pct.    The January/February employment statistics suggest theGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth forthe first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, aneconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.    The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farmjobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain inJanuary and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.    The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate ofabout three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.    Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuildingtheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in thesecond quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in thesecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumptionand government spending. He also sees residential constructiondeclining mostly for multi-family housing units.    Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of thefourth quarter slowness will continue.    Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in thefirst quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter andshow a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.    The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in theU.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline inthe dollar's value over the last year and half.    "The improvement will be gradual and long lasting," Levypredicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but atleast one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as theprices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.    The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,which soared to record levels last year, will improve this yearand the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for theyear compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.    As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate theirdomestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.    U.S. officials believe that would help take some of thepressure off the United States whose five years of economicgrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries.    The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market fortheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed toservice their foreign debt.    The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at amodest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.    There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalancebetween the volume of goods imported to the United States andthose shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume ofexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the factthat in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsenedduring the closing three months of 1986.    While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporateprofits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, thegovernment said. It also reported that inflation, as measuredby the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing amoderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.    The government also reported that consumer spending, a keyelement of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct inFebruary, after falling two pct in January.    The Federal Reserve Board also reported that themanufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elementsof the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.    In its latest report on current economic conditions, theFed said that economic activity in the various regions of thecountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving.Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in mostregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.    Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said thepick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to thedrop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a majorpick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economywill slip into recession either.    He said higher prices on imported products and wage cutsthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeezeconsumers purchasing power.    "That pattern is starting and will continue for a number ofyears," Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering arounda modest two pct level for the next few years. Reuter
GERMAN RETAILERS EXPECT GOOD 1987 West German retailers expect another goodyear in 1987 even though they will not be able to repeat thesharp increase in turnover they enjoyed in 1986, the GeneralAssociation of the German Retail Trade (HDE) said.    HDE President Wolfgang Hinrichs said retailers would besatisfied with a real turnover increase of between 2.5 pct tothree pct in 1987 after last year's steep 3.7 pct rise.

U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER U.S. retailers' lackluster March saleswere due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect arecovery in April.    "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, butunderlying business is better than the numbers indicate," saidBear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.     Analysts generally average the sales results of March andApril to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. Thisyear, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is threeweeks later than last year.    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates saidsales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and aseasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted5.7 pct last year.    "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicatethat the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appearto be because liquidity and employment are rising," saidanalyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming inaccording to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expectedto rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticketitems were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to manyanalysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as theholiday nears.    "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect acontinuing strength in the housing market," said EdwardBrennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co <S> which reported anoverall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women'ssportswear were also excellent.    "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but evena modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishmentdue to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner.     J.C. Penney Co Inc <JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp <DH> wereamong the weaker performers with comparable stores salesdeclining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store andcatalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson'soverall sales rose 4.8 pct.    Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continuedstrong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged fromvery active in the east to weak in the economically depressedsouthwest."    "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activitywear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,but are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of BearStearns.    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter forthe decline. Edelman of Drexel said that "Hudson had a toughercomparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."    Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lowerthan last year.    "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories arebeing kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but salesare coming through anyway," said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.    Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  be better than he had originally expected in the beginning ofthe year.    Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle ofMay.
