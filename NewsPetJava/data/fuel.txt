ECUADOR ADOPTS AUSTERITY MEASURES AFTER QUAKE OPEC member Ecuador adopted austeritymeasures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed bya strong earthquake.    Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced ontelevision the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct.A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinitesuspension of crude oil exports, declaring force majeure.    Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told atelevision interviewer that it could possibly take more than amonth to repair Ecuador's main pipeline linking Amazon basinoil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast.    The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-pointMercalli scale, killed at least six people and was centred nearthe Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito.    Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day.    The government's austerity measures ban the sale ofaviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes andno fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines.    Ecuador also banned the sale of petrol on weekends andholidays and limited sales on weekdays, an Energy and MinesMinistry communique said. REUTER

He said the mooring is the firstof its kind in the U.S.    The new system can accomodate vessels up to 150,000deadweight tons, or one mln barrels of cargo, PRI said. Reuter
SENATE COMMITTEE MAY LOOK AT FUEL TAX PROPOSALS The Senate budget committee sitsdown tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with thebudget writers expected to look at several proposals for fueltaxes and other tax options to cut the budget.    In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number ofrevenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrsa barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just onimported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energyconsumption based on five pct of value.    Other proposals include various excise taxes andcombinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years.    The committee, however, will only include revenue numbersin its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions leftto the House and Senate tax-writing committees.     The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, SenLawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise atleast 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind.    The House Budget Committee also plans to start drafting aseparate budget plan later this week, which would have to bereconciled with the Senate version.

NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE Higher crude oil prices will raisedemand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lostto heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.    The analysts said that these efforts will be mostsuccessful in the industrial sectors of the economy with largeand growing energy requirements.    "Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share ofoil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residualfuel industry last year," Michael Smolinski, an energyeconomist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters.    An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel wentinto the utilities market at the expense of natural gas lastyear when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said.     Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, nationalaverage gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive,Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at AmericanGas Association said.    The average delivered prices at the end of January were2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.    "We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubicfeet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second andthird quarter (1987)," he said.    In addition to price competitiveness, availability will bean important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas,Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp.in New York noted.    Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the NorthAmerican continent has led to a build up of gas inventories andless would be necessary to replenish underground storage thisspring freeing gas for spot sales.    These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fearsthat natural gas suplies would be tight and pricessignificantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling lastyear.    AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline,much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to productionquickly through developments such as the infill drilling whichpermits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.    Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surpluswas likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would notgo away until 1990.    Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus wouldpersist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certainconsuming areas, notably in California and in the NortheastU.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote. Reuter

VENEZUELA RE-ESTABLISHES POSTED PRODUCT PRICES Petroleos de Venezuela, PDVSA, thestate owned oil company, has re-established posted prices forsome light products and heavy fuel oil, industry sources in NewYork said.    The return to posted prices is a sign that the market isreturning to a more stable and orderly condition after a yearof volatile price movements in which Venezuela ceased postingprices and moved to negotiating prices with companies.    "We are in more stable market now and PDVSA has probablydecided to return to postings for some products," one industrytrade source said.       But there was no talk of Venezuela posting prices for crudeoil which were also dropped in 1986.    Posted prices were dropped in the first quarter of 1986  when prices for crude oil and products tumbled in response toOPEC's market share strategy and netback arrangements.    PDVSA has set out posted prices for several groups of lightproducts including gasoline, naphtha, jet kerosene anddistillates effective April 15 as follows.    Unleaded gasoline was posted at 19.74 dlrs a barrel (47 ctsa gallon) with leaded gasoline at 20.16 dlrs a barrel (48 cts agallon).       Light naphtha was posted at 17.85 dlrs a barrel (42.5 cts agallon), full range naphtha at 19.11 dlrs a barrel (45.50 cts agallon), and heavy naphtha at 19.53 cts a gallon (46.5 cts agallon).    Jet kerosene was posted at 18.90 dlrs a barrel, alsoeffective April 15, or (45 cts a gallon) with dual purposekerosene at 18.06 dlrs a barrel (43 cts a gallon).    Distillates of 0.2 pct sulphur and 0.3 pct sulphur gradeswere posted at 18.48 dlrs a barrel (44 cts a gallon), each with0.5 pct sulphur 18.08 dlrs a barrel (43.05 cts a gallon).    LPG postings, also effective from April 15, were made as follows, propane 175 dlrs a tonne (33.33 cts a gallon), butane210 dlrs a tonne (46.26 cts a gallon) and isobutane at 240 dlrsa tonne.    Heavy fuel products were given a posted price effectiveApril 10 and ranged from 0.3 pct sulphur at 19.35 dlrs a barrelto 17.21 dlrs a barrel for 2.8 pct sulphur.

U.S. ENERGY COSTS ROSE IN MARCH BY 1.0 PCT Consumer energy costs rose 1.0 pctin March following a moderate rise last month, the LaborDepartment said.    The March increase in the overall energy costs, includingpetroleum, coal and natural gas, followed a 3.0 pct rise inJanuary and a 1.9 pct rise in February, it said.    However, energy prices were 5.6 pct below year-ago levels.    The department's Consumer Price Index showed that the costof gasoline rose in March by 2.3 pct, after a 4.2 pct rise inFebruary.    Gasoline prices were nonetheless 5.9 pct below their levelsas of March 1986.    Also, the category including fuel oil, coal and bottled gasrose in March by 1.4 pct, putting it 9.0 pct under the year-agofigure.    The index also showed that natural gas and electricity wereunchanged last month, but down 3.1 pct from the March 1986figure, the department said.

EGYPT FUEL PRICE INCREASES PART OF REFORM PACKAGE Egypt has embarked on reforms sought bythe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank byraising the price of diesel oil and other types of transportfuels.    The energy price increases were the first visible measurestaken in return for IMF standby credits and World Bank loans.    Effective today, fuel oil prices were trebled and prices ofgas oil, diesel and kerosene went up by over 50 pct, anEgyptian General Petroleum Corp (EGPC) official said. He saidfuel oil will sell for 28 Egyptian pounds a ton, instead of 7.5pounds.    Kerosene and gas oil were raised by 66 pct to sell for fivepiasters a litre, while diesel rose 50 pct to 4.5 piasters.    The government is expected also to act soon, possibly asearly as next weekend, to simplify the country's complexexchange rate system, bankers said.    Moving towards a more realistic exchange rate for the poundwas part of a package of reforms sought by the IMF and creditorgovernments. In return, Egypt stands to receive up to onebillion dlrs in IMF standby credits phased over three years tohelp it repay its 38.6 billion dlr foreign debt and guaranteerescheduling by western governments, the main creditors.    Energy price increases were also a condition of progress onWorld Bank project loans of up to 800 mln dlrs in energy,communications and other sectors which have been undernegotiation for several months, western diplomats said.    The U.S. And Western Europe have pledged political backingfor President Hosni Mubarak's government, committed to amulti-party political system and peace with Israel andstrategically poised in control of the Suez Canal.    Fuel price rises, postponed at least once and likely tolead to higher retail prices of basic goods, were a test of thegovernment's resolve to pursue economic reform, diplomats said.    But the new prices are still below world market levels.    There was no announcement of increases in more politicallysensitive products such as gasoline or natural gas, used forcooking, and the mass-circulation Al-Akhbar newspaper said theywould stay the same.    Official comment was not available on speculation amongbankers and diplomats that the Central Bank would soon tinkerwith the pound's exchange rates to try to channel more dollarsinto the banking system away from the illegal but toleratedfree market.    The Central Bank was expected to set up a committee inwhich 10 commercial banks, including the four state-ownedbanks, would decide the pound's value every day.    The official "incentive rate," currently set by the CentralBank daily, is around 1.36 pounds to the dollar, against 2.15on the free market.    Bankers predicted that the banks' committee might set ratesaround 1.80 or 1.90. But some doubted this would serve the aimof curbing the free market. REUTER

OIL MARKETS SHOW RESPECT FOR NEW OPEC ACCORD OPEC has shown itself to be in controlof the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out apact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day(bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.    They said market respect for the cartel has increased sinceit announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter outputto 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.    "There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensuredthere will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is ineffect putting pressure on end-users," a European crude oiltrader said.    In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, "There's no reason to expecta weak market from now on."    A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, "Wethought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarterproduction so the market will react very bullishly."    Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only aslight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmarkcrude, they expect price increases over the next few days.    August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity ataround 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but stillbelow the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.    Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and AbuDhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weakpositions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traderssaid sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.    They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices tostabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.    They said the Japanese oil market would be most affectedand Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winterrequirements before October.    Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter onEuropean and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.    "There's no doubt consumption will be higher than productionby the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high," said aninternational trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was lessbullish, "For sure there will be some shortage but it depends onhow much they (OPEC members) cheat."    A Singapore trade source said, "There is enough cheating andleakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there isno need to worry about shortages."    Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearishfactor to be considered.    Traders also said end-users now would buy as much aspossible on term contracts and buy spot only when the marketcooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.    Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed inthin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillatesquiet on minimal buying interest.    Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand andtight prompt supplies, dealers said. REUTER
