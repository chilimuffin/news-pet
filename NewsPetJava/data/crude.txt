OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS OPEC may be forced to meet before ascheduled June session to readdress its production cuttingagreement if the organization wants to halt the current slidein oil prices, oil industry analysts said.    "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easyas OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort outthe problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates, CERA.    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPECfaces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.    "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a productionissue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oilanalyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and itsability to keep production under control have given way to apessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon ifit wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.    But some other analysts were uncertain that even anemergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC productionabove the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.    "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot havedeemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said theregional manager for one of the major oil companies who spokeon condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying toteach them that lesson again," he added.    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPECto meet before June, although not immediately. However, he isnot optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.    "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of thewinter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and Aprilwhen demand slackens," Mizrahi said.    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything morethan reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical forOPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.    "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weekssince buyers will come back into the market then," said DillardSpriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energyand Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oilhas been rising through the first quarter and this may haveprompted excesses in its production.    "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpdand is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what weare seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting thisdemand through current production," he told Reuters in atelephone interview.

TEXACO CANADA CUTS CRUDE PRICES 64 CANADIAN CTS/BBL, PAR GRADE TO 22.26 CANAD Brazil's 14-bank advisory committeeexpressed "grave concern" to chief debt negotiator AntonioPadua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interestpayments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibankto creditor banks worldwide.    Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep angerand frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral movelast Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrsof short-term trade and interbank lines.    Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank's foreigndebt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.    Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibankexecutive William Rhodes and representatives from committeevice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc,told the banks that the government was preparing a telex toexplain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.    The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today,bankers said.    Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plansfor Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercialbankers during his trip to Washington on Friday and Saturday.    Funaro will be explaining Brazil's actions to U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman PaulVolcker and International Monetary Fund managing directorMichel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.    Meanwhile, bankers were to hear in New York this afternoonwhat impact Brazil's hard line would have on Argentina, with aninitial presentation from Argentine Treasury Secretary MarioBrodersohn on his country's request for 2.15 billion dlrs innew loans and a multi-year rescheduling agreement.

KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS Kuwait"s Oil Minister, in remarkspublished today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPECmeeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in worldoil prices.    Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the localdaily al-Qabas as saying: "None of the OPEC members has askedfor such a meeting."    He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed productionlimits of the 13-nation organisation.    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimateOPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mlnbpd agreed in Geneva last December.    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along withthe much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing abovequota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.    "This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which saidKuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose thatbecause Kuwait has the ability, it will do so," the ministersaid.    Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability toproduce up to 4.0 mln bpd.    "If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing theirshare, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever," he said.    He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpdof its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resistingofficial prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a markerof 18 dlrs per barrel.    Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levelsthis year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of19 dollars a barrel.    Sheikh Ali also delivered "a challenge to any internationaloil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices."    Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs abarrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.    However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil becauseof its local and international refining facilities and its owndistribution network abroad, he added.    He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC"sdifferentials committee has been postponed until the start ofApril at the request of certain of the body"s members.    Ecuador"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite saidlast Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assigna lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this attalks this month of opec"s pricing committee.    Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, inapparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: "Weexpected such pressure. It will continue through March andApril." But he expected the situation would later improve. REUTER
INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE Indonesia appears to be nearing apolitical crossroads over measures to deregulate its protectedeconomy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.    To counter falling oil revenues, the government haslaunched a series of measures over the past nine months toboost exports outside the oil sector and attract newinvestment.    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leadingprimary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year"sfall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue itscurrency by 31 pct in September.    But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto"sgovernment appears to be divided over what direction to leadthe economy.    "(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard toderegulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,"the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia"s agriculturalsector, but also reviews the country"s general economicperformance.    It says that while many government officials and advisersare recommending further relaxation, "there are equally strongpressures being exerted to halt all such moves."    "This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,"the report says.    Indonesia"s economic changes have been welcomed by the WorldBank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics andsteel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.    Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced traderestrictions and liberalised imports.    The report says Indonesia"s economic growth in calendar 1986was probably about zero, and the economy may even havecontracted a bit. "This is the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s," the report notes.    Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with apopulation of 168 million, is facing general elections inApril.    But the report hold out little hope for swift improvementin the economic outlook. "For 1987 early indications point to aslightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economicactivity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in exportearnings from the petroleum industry."    "Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weakdomestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, realdeclines in construction and trade, and a reduced level ofgrowth in agriculture," the report states.    Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms iscrucial for the government to get the international lending itsneeds.    A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balanceof payments support was given partly to help the governmentmaintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said. REUTER

QATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88 The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recoveringslightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected adeficit of 5.472 billion riyals.    The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyalsin the last published budget for 1985/86.    In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister SheikhAbdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected tospend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.    Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6billion riyals.    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86projected revenue of 9.7 billion.    The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due touncertainty surrounding oil revenues.    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the governmentdecided to limit recurrent expenditure each month toone-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15pct.    He urged heads of government departments and publicinstitutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. Hedid not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed onthe country's foreign reserves.    He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had beenallocated for major projects including housing and publicbuildings, social services, health, education, transport andcommunications, electricity and water, industry andagriculture.    No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence andsecurity. There was also no projection for oil revenue.    Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000barrels per day.    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: "Our expectations of positive signsregarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC'sdetermination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect itswealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the comingyear's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."

SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC PACT Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazerreiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPECaccord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, theofficial Saudi Press Agency SPA said.    Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free marketoil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below thepronounced prices under any circumstance."    Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free marketprices "may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)winter season and the glut in the market."    Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord,under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixedprices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.    The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets,which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel inmid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market pricesare currently just over 16 dlrs.    Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia'sadherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.    He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they allwanted to stick to the accord.    In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is alsoNigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with thepricing agreement.    "We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulatethe operations of the market, but we are satisfied that thefundamentals exist for stable market conditions," he said.    Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, saidin remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there wereno plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimateOPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.

SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD Saudi crude oil output last month fellto an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpdin January, Gulf oil sources said.    They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymahterminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last monthfrom 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by somecustomers.    But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulfexports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpdfrom 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.    The production figures include neutral zone output but notsales from floating storage, which are generally consideredpart of a country's output for Opec purposes.    Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under aproduction restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation grouplast December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrsa barrel.    The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last weekappeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift Februaryentitlements before the month-end.    Last week's high export levels appeared to show continuedsupport for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crudecustomers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.    The four -- Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Texaco Inc<TX> and Chevron Corp <CHV> -- signed a long-term agreementlast month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.    However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia'sability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market willcome this month, when demand for petroleum productstraditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recentweeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.    Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterdayreiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accordand said it would never sell below official prices.    The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fellslightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln inJanuary because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail exportrefineries.    They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpdlast month, compared to zero in January, while throughput atBahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steadyat around 200,000 bpd each.

NYMEX WILL EXPAND OFF-HOUR TRADING APRIL ONE The New York Mercantile Exchange setApril one for the debut of a new procedure in the energycomplex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.

"This will change the way oil is transacted in the realworld," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.    Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEXprices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at adifferential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.     The expanded program "will serve the industry because theoil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza,secretary of Century Resources Inc.     The rule change, which has already taken effect forplatinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the openinterest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according totraders and analysts.    Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, calledan exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures positionbefore entering into the transaction.    Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold afutures position before entering into an EFP and one or bothparties can offset their cash transaction with a futurescontract the next day, according to exchange officials.    When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December,NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFPprovision will add to globalization of the energy markets byproviding for, in effect, 24-hour trading."

The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa onthe Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, andconstruction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery.    The project also includes construction of liquifiedpetroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additionalcrude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammoniacomplex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansionof the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said.    Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment andmaterials for the project, he said.

He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in thespot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, andpredict the price will be better in the third and fourthquarters."    Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stockdeliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the priceto fall. But Opec would get through this period if membersstuck together. REUTER
OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT Crude oil prices rallied today, movingover 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determinedeffort to support prices, analysts said.    "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this withoutanother meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst withShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due toseasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added.    Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attemptto get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount fromthe official prices agreed to last december.    The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministersof the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at theCooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.    The Saudis have also offered to support members havingdifficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.    "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and toprevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPECmember will allocate some of their oil sales to help membersthat lose sales," Margoshes said.    He added that the allocations would probably be in the formof loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.    Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in linenations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But itis also likely that such assistance would be provided toNigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPECpresident Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPECmeeting for fear that it would give the appearance that theDecember pact is falling apart.    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, UphamHarris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have beenoversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a shortcovering rally."    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, whichrefused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refinersinto the market to cover their short positions.    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the marketto but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideastsours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after tradingyeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into theNorth sea crude oil market.    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors todaythat Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brentfor Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vesselsbeing fixed to make such shipments.    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with tradesreported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.    OPEC members' denials that they are producing over theirquotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPECproduction was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to lastdecember but he gave no details on OPEC production againstclaims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.    "The production probably is about their quota level andlargely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sellits oil as a result," Margoshes said.    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of thecurrent rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise ifSaudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.    But others said that despite the rally today there werestill several fundamental factors, including demand, whichcould cut the rally short.    Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, saidslow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keepdemand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to riseabout 1.4 pct over 1986.

SAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuringother members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries to stay within their production quotas, said MorganStanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.    Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oilengineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations toattempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several yearsto keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.    "Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concertedeffort by the Saudis to get production down," Wellemeyer said.    "The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs abarrel) and are willing to make it happen again," he said.    In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs abarrel level on market reports of some OPE members producingabove their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mlnbarrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on abelief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.    Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil productioncould push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day asearly as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.    Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oilshould strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed theorganization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs abarrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users fromswitching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing marketaccounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of theworld demand for oil. Reuter

ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION Drilling for oil in California islikely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levelsdespite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analystssaid.    Because much of the crude oil in California fields isthick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have toincrease to near 1985's levels before any significant recoveryis seen in drilling, they said.    "Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,"said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.    Few new wells now are being drilled.    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, comparedto about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger OilInformation Services, which tracks California drillingactivity.    "It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state'sdrilling activity.    Current prices are not enough to justify increaseddrilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California IndependentProducers Association.    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pactto curb production boosted oil prices early this year, priceseventually fell.    Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, haveslumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a highof about 17 dlrs.    More than half of California's oil comes from stripperwells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and thatmuch of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel toextract, Malmgreen said.    "It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,"Malmgreen said.    Many stripper wells along the southern California coastproduce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inlandwells frequently require the use of steam injection to spurextraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.    The outlook for future production in California is cloudedby a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.    In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, whichproduces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratorydrilling has slowed to a crawl.    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell ofthe state energy commission. So far this year only fiveexploratory wells have been drilled.    "I don't think they'll even get to what they did lastyear," Mitchell said.    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest ofthe decade, Mitchell said.    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in thenumber of producing wells and overall production.    Between February and October of 1986, the number ofproducing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 frommore than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California EnergyCommission.    In line with that decrease, California's crude oil outputfell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and isexpected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.    Between February and October 1986, California's crude oilproduction slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrelsper day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.    Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department ofConservation.    "Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,"Guerard said. Reuter

U.K. OIL INDUSTRY SAID NOT PERMANENTLY DAMAGED The U.K. Offshore oil industry hassuffered from last year's collapse in oil prices but should notsustain any permament damage, Minister of State for EnergyAlick Buchanan-Smith said.    The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had beenmost affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energycommittee. He noted, however, that oil companies were stillspending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production.    He added that a report by the manpower services committeewhich said 14,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1986 shouldbe seen in the context of a total workforce of 300,000.    Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of8.50dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs theprevious November.    They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after lastDecember's OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15dlrs.    Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adoptingOPEC style quotas, noting that Britian is an oil-consuming aswell as an oil-producing nation. Reuter
TEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS Texas Railroad Commissioner JamesNugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait forCongress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adoptincentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severancetaxes on oil produced from stripper wells.    Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house ofrepresentatives that the state must take the initiative inmolding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assisttroubled oil producers.    His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exemptstripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each dayfrom the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that themajority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper wellcategory and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can becrucial in determining if the well remains in production.    Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt newwildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five yearsas a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.    Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods ofproduction that inject water or gas into the ground to recoveroil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugentsaid. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiarywells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a dayfor three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 abarrel.    "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federaladministrations to develop a coherent energy policy for thenation to follow. I say we have waited long enough," Nugentsaid. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead,follow, or get out of the way."    Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasuryby exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxeswould be more than made up by stimulating new business for theoil supply and service industry.

OPEC SAYS FEBRUARY OUTPUT UNDER CEILING OPEC output in February was "well below"the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countriesare strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agencyOpecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying.    The official was quoted as saying that lower output was theresult "of member countries' firm determination to defend theorganisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and torefrain from selling any quantity below that price."    The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that noOPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC sessionplanned to start on June 25.    The official gave no figure for February output. Thestatement said only that "the reduction in total supplies,namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus localdeliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced asthose supplies fell very noticeably during that month."    "No matter what the pressure on member countries by liftersto align the official selling price to the ongoing marketprice, member countries are, without exception, strictlyadhering to the official selling price in spite of thefinancial hardship this may entail," the statement said.    "The very recent improvement in the price structure is anindicator of such determination by the organization to stick tothe official selling price," the statement said.    Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs abarrel in early December last year to near OPEC's officiallevels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.    There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC mighthave to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduledJune session to discuss reports of overproduction by somestates and strains on the differential matrix, which priceseach OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from mainmarkets.    The official said in the statement that no such emergencysession was scheduled "because of member countries' firmdetermination to defend the price (system)" agreed in December.    Opec"s differential committee was to have met in Viennastarting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with nonew date set, according to an official of the United ArabEmirates, which chairs the seven-state body.

OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukmansaid the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpdceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had beendelayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opecprices.    Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home fromJamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that inFebruary, Opec had underproduced partly because members werestrictly abiding by production quotas and partly because theywere resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to officialprices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.    "We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,"he said. "I have spoken to every other Opec minister and theyare committed to making the accord work," he said.    Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. Hesaid the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing thesefigures.    Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimatedthat Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, hesaid; "That could well be correct."    Opec"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement sayinggroup output was "well below" its ceiling in February. But itgave no figures.    But one source close to Opec indicated that February outputmay have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.    The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around16 mln bpd.    Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.    Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had allproduced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which saidit would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the Decemberpact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.    Lukman said that some industry reports "may be correct" thatin February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mlnallocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.    He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by hiscountry were coming under price pressure because they werecurrently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades andthe United States" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.    However, he said Opec in December had anticipated thatdemand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasonsand expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.    "We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market isnow firming on actual fundamentals," he said, adding that heexpected it to go "up and up" even beyond official prices afterearly April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demandfor gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria"s.    The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuelaand Indonesia were having less problems with output thanproducers like his own country because they exported oilproducts.    Also, some of Venezuela"s heavy grades were outside the Opecpricing system, he said.    Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to liftsome Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocksand ran them down to "dangerous levels," they would eventuallyhave to buy Opec oil.    "When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)they will realise they should buy now instead of paying morelater on," he said.    Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was beingpressured by equity producers for better terms, said it wasimportant to know that terms with them were negotiable,flexible and under constant review, not only when the marketseemed weak.    He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nationministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and thatsuch a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priorityfor Opec at the moment.    "At this time, we have to get our priorities right," he said."The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord isworking, not dealing with a differential of cents betweengrades."    But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections overthe differential system, a meeting would be called, he said. Reuter

IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrelsper day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln theprevious month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter1986, the International Energy Agency said.    A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the productionquotas set at their last conference in December, but liftingswere reduced from several countries, it said in its latestmonthly oil market report.    These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance tofixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly forfixed volumes over an extended period.

Contracts for Saudi crude have beensigned, but it is understood they have much leeway in requiredliftings.    The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks onIranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed pricesapparently cut February production.    It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through theTurkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internalconsumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.    The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply inFebruary at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.    The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpdOPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids(ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd otherdeveloping countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpdwith centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd ofnon-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal)and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.    Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expectedin February in accordance with government curtailments ofapproximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.

ECUADOR SAYS SUSPENDS OIL EXPORTS DUE EARTHQUAKE Ecuador today suspended its crude oilexports indefinitely due to an earthquake last night thatdamaged pumping and crude transport installations, an Energyand Mines MInistry statement said.    It said the state oil firm Corporacion Estatal PetroleraEcuatoriana (CEPE) notified foreign customers that it wasdeclaring force majeure on its crude exports due to the tremor.    Ecuador"s OPEC oil output quota is 210,000 barrels per day(bpd).    A senior energy ministry official said that one pumpingstation at El Salado on Ecuador's main pipeline was damaged.    He also said an 180 metre section of the pipeline attachedto the bridge over the Aguarico river collapsed.    The pumping station was about 20 km from the Reventadorvolcano, near the epicentre of the quake, which Ecuadoreanseismologists said registered six on the 12-point internationalMercalli scale. The Aguarico bridge was also close to thevolcano, he said.    The quake struck northern Ecaudor and southern Colombia,according to Ecuadorean officials. No injuries were reported. REUTER

Exports in january totalled 123,000 bpd.    The quake, which in Colombia measured between 6.5 and sevenon the 12-point international Mercalli scale, caused panicamong residents but no injuries were reported. Reuter
CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the pricecould rise another dollar as inventories fall.    "OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash marketthere is tight supply of crude with short transportation timeto major refining centers," said Daniel McKinley, oil analystwith Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. "That could send prices50 cts to a dollar higher," he added.    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.    The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell inFebruary more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs abarrel.    "Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption thatoil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have comeunder question," McKinley said.    Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthlyreport said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or inindustrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd duringthe first quarter of this year.    IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the firstquarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whoseinventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mlntonnes, or about 74 days consumption.    Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpddraw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterdayfed speculation that other major companies were destocking.    Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of aso-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buyingofficially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organizationto offer discounts to the official price.    "This struggle between the companies and OPEC is theultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relativelysoon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),"the general trading manager of an international oil companytold Reuters in a telephone interview.    For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cuttingexcess supplies from the market by a reduction of its ownoutput, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output tobe 14.7 mln bpd this week.    Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspendoil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.    "This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expectingit to be there," McKinley said.    International oil traders said that other short-haulcrudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asianrefiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readilyavailable Mideast crudes earlier this week.    If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid upthe price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, tradingmanagers at several companies told Reuters.    But there were skeptics who said they wondered how longOPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.    Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg CommodityManagement, said OPEC production was lower "because of theSaudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if itgives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas."     He added, "The Saudis will be picking up the tab for othermembers who produce over their quota, and the drain on theSaudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as lowas 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price," he added.    There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in thespot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.    Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for deliveryinto the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, whichtraded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.    Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the FarEast at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.    "There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-governmentdeals, which are below official prices and this is probablybeing resold," one international trader said. Reuter

ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL The suspension of Ecuador's crude oilshipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last atleast four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.    The official said Ecuador could resume exports afterrepairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which linksjungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to thepipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oilaccounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as60 pct of government revenues.    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisationof Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumpingabout 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpdabove the output quota assigned by the cartel, another EnergyMinistry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombianpipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could takeabout 60 days to build.    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the endof January, about equal to one month's imports.    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billiondlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country'stotal foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest inLatin America.    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela wouldloan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next threemonths to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic suppliesand would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela inrepayment in May, Lusinchi said.

IRAN SELLING DISCOUNTED CRUDE, JAPAN TRADERS SAY Japanese customers have bought nearly sixmln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company(NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, andWestern traders have received even larger discounts, Japanesetraders involved in the transactions told Reuters.    NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanesecustomers with different formulas. One company has bought800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.    Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman andDubai spot prices less a discount, they said.    Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed toreverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spotmarkets, oil traders said.    Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colderweather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output wasbelow its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.

SAUDI ARABIA'S KING FAHD WANTS STABLE OIL PRICES King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wantsoil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers toavoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group.    His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the televisionnews agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will maketo Britain later this month.    King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be preparedto reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mlnbarrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark priceagreed to by OPEC last December.    The King replied: "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices byitself but certainly desires price stability."    Non-OPEC countries "must help us in a framework of commoninterest so that there is no type of competition which couldprove harmful to everyone," he said.    Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a firststep towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was notfor Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine suchissues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higherbenchmark.    In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure,due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahdsaid Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, wasadhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference whichset a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.    A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted thegroup's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.    The King also urged the world community to help thePalestinians return to their homeland and called for a peacefulend to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not beresolved on the battlefield, he said. REUTER

Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crudefrom jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, wouldbe repaired with the help of Texaco Inc <TX.N> and a Mexicanand an Argentine firm.    President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago thatEcuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exportsfor four months due to the quake.    Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds ofEcuador's total exports and as much as 60 pct of governmentrevenues.    Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuadorwould have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil tomeet its needs until the line was repaired.    The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, PatricioQuevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador fivemln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a180-day period.    He added the Caracas-based Andean Development Corp hadgranted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline,50 km of which had been damaged in the quake.    In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterdaysummoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issuedappeal for emergency aid for the country. Only three countries,the U.S., Colombia and Venezuela, had offered assistance. REUTER
TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN The oil services industry is on theverge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oilindustry analysts said.    The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on somestocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in thesecond half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in thefirst half, and continue into the next decade.     "People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to goup to start buying," said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior researchanalyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc.    Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>,Halliburton Co <HAL>, Dresser Industries <DI>, BakerInternational <BKO>, and McDermott International Inc <MDR>,which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, aDallas-based investor.    Analysts said although major oil companies are increasingexploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup inoil services will begin in the U.S.    "Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move upfaster," said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs.    The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co<HT> figures show.    The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 isprojected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge,vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. "Thefirst significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in thesecond half of 1988," Kerridge said.    Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similarpattern, Kerridge said.    "Halliburton is the best value," said Jeffrey Freedman,vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, addingthe company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of commonstock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess,and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cashflow including debt.    Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil servicestock.    "Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominanttechnical leader in the industry," Freedman said.    "Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring,including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and itsconsiderable cash horde sets the stage for the company tomaximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize onthe project upturn in exploration and development activity,"according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president atRobert W. Baird and Co Inc.    Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 ctsin 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87billion dlrs.    Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oilservice companies and said choosing among them is difficult.Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in apossible merger with Hughes Tool Co.    Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery butpossibly not as much as other companies because it is not apure service company, Sweeney said.    Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to costreductions and streamlined operations, including the sale andleaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup. Reuter
ECUADOR DEPUTY MINISTER SEEKS OIL AID IN VENEZUELA Ecuador's deputy energy ministerFernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks onfurther Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industryfollowing last week's earthquake, officials said.    Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for anexpected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles ofpipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port ofBalao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.    Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lendEcuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.    The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports thatVenezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota,set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987.    "All options are open at this moment in the context ofcooperation on oil production," a Venezuelan energy and minesministry source said.    Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula tocompensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while thepipeline is repaired, officials said.    Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and minesminister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks attechnical level, officials said.    Industry sources said that among the options are forVenezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuelaand non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supplyEcuador's Far Eastern clients.    But the ministry source said that no decision has yet beenreached on the matter, and that an announcement would be madein due course.    Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would haveto import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet itsneeds until the line was repaired.    Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teransaid last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair thedamage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake. REUTER

MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS Most Japanese companies have decided notto renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spotprices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels,industry sources said.    They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubaitraded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to itsofficial price of 17.42 dlrs.    Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract forIranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.    The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting atotal of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crudeunder term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift inthe second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.    They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discountson cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discountsdepended largely on the levels of spot prices.    "If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we wouldprobably buy Iranian crude at the official price," one Japaneserefiner said.    "We don't intend to put pressure on them," he added.    Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oilat official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades areconsiderably lower, oil traders said.    They said if spot prices move higher there will be noproblem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil afterfinding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem islikely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus.    The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself fromOPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to thefixed prices.    But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close toits first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demandwould be balanced by the end of the second quarter.    They also said if OPEC holds its official price structurebased on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuationsshould be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai anda 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.    One Japanese refiner said, "At the moment there's a lot ofpressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold outthere will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust theirability."    Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukmantold a news conference in Lagos yesterday, "Nigeria and allmember countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold theDecember agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotasand official selling prices."    He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocksof both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levelswell below this time last year. He said consumers would soonreturn to the market in search of crude.    A Japanese refiner said, "The European and U.S. Markets arebeginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky."
SAUDI OUTPUT SAID AT YEAR LOW TO HELP OPEC Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen toits lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence ofthe kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs abarrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sourcessaid.    They said Saudi output in the first eight days of Marchaveraged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from theneutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February averageof 3.5 mln bpd.    They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crudeoil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must becounted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia'squota is 4.133 mln bpd.    The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, theworld"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opecofficial prices, even at the cost of lower production, thesources said.    King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview withReuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudicommitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to anaverage 18 dlrs.    "Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions," hesaid.    The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf portsaveraged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday,down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd.    They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuatewith lifting nominations and was not trying to maintainartificially high levels by putting oil into storage.    The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms withpast stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon,Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in thetiming and volume of their liftings but are bound to payofficial prices, the sources said.    Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks butstill remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayedliftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.    They expected low early March output to pick up towards theend of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractualobligations. REUTER

WILDLIFE UNIT PROPOSES ALASKA REFUGE OIL STUDY The National Wildlife Federation rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wildernesslands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration.    The federation, the nation's largest conservation group,said further study was needed to assess any possible damagethat development might have on the wildlife in the area, thecoastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.    Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, calledthe Interior's research into the effects of development "sofundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis onwhich to make a public policy decision."    Hair called the department's proposal a "reflection of alargely political decision," adding "we have no confidence inInterior to represent the broad public interest in this area."    Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plainto oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen.    It said a preliminary survey showed the region could holdbillions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential asan energy resource would never be known without exploration.    Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.    Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gasexploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain awildlife refuge protected from commercial development.    Hair said Interior's report failed to stress theprobability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.    He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas,fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gatherednor had the department consulted the Environmental ProtectionAgency on the possible effects of exploration.    The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that anine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of theissue and report back to Congress in about two years.    Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possibleexploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate tomake a sound judgement.    Congressional observers said that at present there waslittle sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area forcommercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that theUnited States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil. reuter

Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd.    Several other Mediterranean refineries are currentlyshutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled somemonths ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may havebeen rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude.     Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products marketsbullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said.    Garrone's refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) isdue to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and thejointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th followingits closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesmansaid.    The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa willnot be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said.    In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise deBP's Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance sinceMarch 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pctcapacity, a company spokesman said.    Shell Francaise's Berre l'Etang refinery will shut down inearly April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacityis around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR)will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in earlyApril, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, acompany spokesman said.

BRAZIL CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA Brazil's state-oil company,Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from SaudiArabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guaranteesfrom the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said.    Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference theSaudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose suchconditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment ofits commercial debts last month.    The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oilconsumption in Brazil.    But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds anddecide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobraswill lift the order to cancel the shipment.    Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms byMonday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.    "Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be muchbetter for us, because with the market prices more or less thesame, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage," he said.    Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importingBrazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothingfrom Brazil, he said.    Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industryworkers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobrasoil stocks are "reasonably balanced."     Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, withan average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.    "If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, Iam sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offersfrom elsewhere," Santana added. Reuter

VENEZUELA TO LEND ECUADOR 50,000 BPD OF CRUDE Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to helpit meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines MinisterArturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.    He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during avisit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy MinisterFernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan inAugust.    Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way tooffsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused byearthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipelineconnecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balaowas put out of action.    Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador'sis 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC toallow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when thepipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.    Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrelsshipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador thisweekend to help meet domestic consumption needs.    The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan byVenezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries.    "If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of thiscountry would have ground to a halt," he said. Reuter

ECUADOR BEGINS WORK ON OIL PIPELINE TO COLOMBIA Construction workers today began buildinga 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador's jungle oilfieldsto a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude couldbe pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitryofficials said.    They said it would take about two months and at least 15mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador toPuerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombianpipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia'sPacific Ocean coast.    The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed totransport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) ofEcuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said.    The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room forEcuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadoreanenergy ministry official said.    The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped byboat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domesticdemand.    The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador toresume some of production, paralysed since March six by an earthquake the night before.    The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungleoilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the PacificOcean.    Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before theearthquake. It would take about five months to repair thepipeline to Balao, government officials said.    Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mlndlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake,energy ministry Javier Espinosa said.    Reuter
VENEZUELA TO LEND UP TO 12.5 MLN BARRELS OF OIL Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitmentsand its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and MinesMinister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipelineconnecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port ofBalao was damaged last week by an earthquake.    Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for atotal of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet exportcommitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crudeand provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said.     Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed itsexports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task thatwould take an estimated five  months.    Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude forrefining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador wouldrepay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.    Both countries are the only Latin American members of theOrganisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).    Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before theearthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total outputwas around 260,000 bpd. Reuter

SAUDI OIL MINISTER FORESEES NO NEED FOR NEW OPEC MEASURES BEFORE Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazersaid OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and therewas no immediate need to change it.    Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television newsagency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around threemln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPECquota.    Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, willcontinue to restrain production as long as other OPEC membersadhere to the pact, Nazer said.    The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its productionceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed pricesaveraging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.    Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed ZakiYamani last October, said: "I do not foresee any need for newmeasures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meetingwill take place as scheduled."    Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and allmembers were abiding by its agreements.    "We've heard news every now and then of violations but theywere not at all verified," he said.    OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.    Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February buthave firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels astraders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.    Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.    "As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program asdevised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere tothe agreement," he said.    Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from theNeutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floatingstorage, Nazer said.    King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters andVisnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil pricestability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmfulcompetition with OPEC.    "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainlydesires price stability," he said.    Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom hadreturned to a role of "swing producer" within OPEC.    Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mlnbpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand andover-production by some OPEC states.    "Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being playedby OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by othermembers of OPEC," Nazer said.    Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during thirdquarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.    But he said if circumstances changed "I am sure then theOPEC members will consult with each other and take thenecessary measures."    Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain whendemand for petroleum products generally falls in the northernhemisphere spring and summer.    Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperationfrom non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Unionagreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports afterhe visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.    "We did not ask any country to do anything. These wereprogrammes they thought were necessary to stabilise marketconditions and to help themselves attain better pricingconditions," Nazer said.    He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate-- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals ifthey saw fit. REUTER
SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TO DISCUSS PRIVATE SECTOR Saudi Arabian businessleaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing outproblems facing the private sector of the kingdom'soil-dependent economy.    The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across SaudiArabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry andcommerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices.    The four-day conference in this resort town, high in themountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea,has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce.    Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and CommerceMinister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day.    Bankers and businessmen said the conference will airproblems facing commerce and industry after last year's slidein oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment ina private sector sorely short of finance.    Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia,the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster privateenterprise to diversify its oil-based economy.    The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the MiddleEast recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturingand trading companies ran into problems repaying loans.    Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accordreached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boostprices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel.    With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at theturn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing downforeign reserves.    The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure ofconfidence to the business community.    Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since lastNovember, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in thenumber of new non-performing loans.    But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporatefinance manager in Riyadh said: "Banks are still reluctant tolend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I amnot sure if it is firmly based."    Some businessmen and bankers point out that governmentspending is still under tight control and the non-oil economymay still be contracting.    Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply.A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before thebudget said: "While industrialisation has continued to be one ofthe government's highest priorities, the recession, thepayments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudiand foreign investor interest in industry."    It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be amajor issue among the businessmen gathered here.    Official figures show the number of new licences forindustrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March1986, compared with the same period in 1985.    Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a majorsource of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983.    Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with hugeinventories of construction equipment as recession bit.    Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories.Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reachedagreement with bankers to extend debt repayments.    The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotelsconglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled adraft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals ofbank debt.    Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likelyto discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms tostep up investment in the kingdom.    A British government delegation has just left Riyadh afterholding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudioutlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraftworth five billion stg.

MEES SAYS SECOND WEEK MARCH OPEC OUTPUT 14 MLN BPD OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd ofoil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below itsceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey andEcuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated.    A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline throughTurkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador haveshut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuadorhas an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.    MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the firstweek of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition tooutput from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.    MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd ofits total production into floating storage.    Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and thetelevision news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output,including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.    The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyanoil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared withits 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lowerthan that.    It said one major Libyan equity producer had partiallystopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for Marchbecause Libya was insisting on official prices, but is stilllifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and afurther 25,000 bpd of "purchase crude."    It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not liftat official prices.    MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and membercountries calling for the formation of a committee to studywhat it said were inequalities in marketing potential amongvarious members.    The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad washaving difficulty selling crude at official prices.    The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countriesexport substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPECprice regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crudeon which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and"other forms of hydrocarbons" which are marketed in package dealswith crude oil.

ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN President Leon Febres Cordero saidEcuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to makepayments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would haveto be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.    Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake wasforcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on theslide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments toprivate foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16billion dlr foreign debt.    "All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," thepresident said during a visit to the quake zone. "A governmentas a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain."    Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oilwould have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be ableto meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.    He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrsa barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.    Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and aprice freeze on key consumer goods as a result of theearthquake, which killed at least 300 people.    Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget wouldbe cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen andsalaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet,would be reduced.    He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basicconsumer items, mainly food staples, while the price ofgasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fareswould rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited. Reuter
PARIBAS SEEKING TO ADJUST ECUADOR OIL FACILITY Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the countryrecover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.    But the French bank's plan, which would effectivelypostpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for severalmonths, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52members of the loan syndicate.    The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports wasruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five monthsto repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.    President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated totaldamages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said thatEcuador as a result would maintain January's suspension ofinterest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.    Payments were halted in January because of the drop in theprice of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador'sexport earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.    Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in theParibas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a jobfor international financial organizations and not forcommercial banks, bankers said.    The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed lastOctober 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for aLatin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted inAugust 1982.    Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel stronglythat the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, theyfear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditionsfor Latin borrowers will be set back.    "There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feelit's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of arestructuring would look bad," one banker commented. Reuter
SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER PACT Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazersaid OPEC's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and therewas no immediate need to change it.    Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television newsagency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around threemln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPECquota.    Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, willcontinue to restrain production as long as other OPEC membersadhere to the pact, Nazer said.    The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its productionceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed pricesaveraging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.    Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed ZakiYamani last October, said: "I do not foresee any need for newmeasures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meetingwill take place as scheduled."    Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and allmembers were abiding by its agreements.    "We've heard news every now and then of violations but theywere not at all verified," he said.    OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.    Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February buthave firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels astraders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.    Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.    "As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program asdevised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere tothe agreement," he said.    Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from theNeutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floatingstorage, Nazer said.    King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters andVisnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil pricestability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmfulcompetition with OPEC.    "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainlydesires price stability," he said.    Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom hadreturned to a role of "swing producer" within OPEC.    Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mlnbpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand andover-production by some OPEC states.    "Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being playedby OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by othermembers of OPEC," Nazer said.    Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during thirdquarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.    But he said if circumstances changed "I am sure then theOPEC members will consult with each other and take thenecessary measures."    Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain whendemand for petroleum products generally falls in the northernhemisphere spring and summer.    Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperationfrom non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Unionagreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports afterhe visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.    "We did not ask any country to do anything. These wereprogrammes they thought were necessary to stabilise marketconditions and to help themselves attain better pricingconditions," Nazer said.    He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate-- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals ifthey saw fit.
SAUDIS DROP CONDITION FOR OIL SALE TO BRAZIL Saudi Arabia has dropped itscondition that Brazil secure international bank guaranteesbefore Saudia Arabia would ship it oil, state-oil companyPetrobras said in a statement.    Petrobras said the Saudis will accept Banco do Brasilcredit guarantees.    Petrobras cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase fromthe Saudis yesterday after they refused to accept a letter ofcredit from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis haddemanded that Brazil get credit guarantees from leadinginternational banks.    Petrobras said the Saudis had been advised that if they didnot change their mind by Monday, Petrobras would negotiate thepurchase of oil with other producers.    The Petrobras statement said the shipment of 2.2 mlnbarrels will be made by the Saudis on March 24 as scheduled.    The shipment was part of a contract signed in February forthe Saudis to supply Brazil with 125,000 barrels per day untilJune. REUTER
STUDY PREDICTS U.S. DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL A government study has concluded theU.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into thenext century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability,the New York Times said.    The newspaper said the inter-agency government study founda serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily fallingdomestic production and rising demand for imported oil.    The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relyingon foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peakof 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate duringthe 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.    The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said.    It said recommendations sent to the White House by EnergySecretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raisedomestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from thecurrent 8.4 mln barrels.    The newspaper said the administration has placed increasedemphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now heldis that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in timesof shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day,rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget.   The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring thedepletion allowance to major producers.    "The administration also plans to renew its efforts to...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling onthe outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits theuse of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers," it added.    The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahomaas saying the study greatly underestimated potential U.S.Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimatedthe amount of domestic oil which would be produced.

SHEARSON LEHMAN UPGRADES U.S. OIL STOCKS Analyst Sanford Margoshes of ShearsonLehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stockstoday now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded inholding to its prescribed production quotas.    "It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quotarestraint, will boost the price of oil," Margoshes said.    Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response tohigher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas. Margoshessaid he recommends Imperial Oil <IMO.A>, up 1/2 to 49-1/8,Standard Oil Co <SRD>, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon <XON> one to83-1/8, and Chevron <CHV> 1-1/8 to 54-7/8.    In addition, Margoshes said he recommended AtlanticRichfield <ARC> on a short-term basis, though he said he isstill suspect about its debt situation. Atlantic Richfield rose1-3/4 to 77.    He said "the market could come down to test the 16 dlr abarrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil ispositive right now. Before the year is out we will see higheroil prices."    He noted that belief that the government is interested inraising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oilstocks today. Reuter
EXXON <XON> MAY CLOSE ONE FRENCH REFINERY Exxon Corp, the world's largest oilcompany, said in a published interview today that it wasreviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide toclose on of its french refineries.    Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's new president, singled out thepossibility of a closure of one of Exxon's refineries in Franceduring the interview.    An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond hadspecifically mentioned refineries in France but said that nospecific refinery had been named. She also said that all ofExxon's opertations were under constant review.    Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in themediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day andPort Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity.    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential tradejournal, said, in its current issue, that they understood thatExxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures inAntwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy.    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc saidthat with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and theimprovement in the European refining situation, its futureprofits there should be good.    "Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch ofrefineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of theindepedents out of the market. Now with demand for productsrising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superiorearnings," Mlotok said.    "Just after Royal Dutch <RD>, they are seen as one of thehighest grade refiners in Europe," he added.    Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely tofeel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europewhere competition from the OPEC countries is increasing asthese producers move further into downstream operations.    PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expectincreased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC exportrefineries.    PIW said "sales from Libya, Algeria and elsewhere areexpected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other Europeanrefiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil lastyear." Reuter
LAWSON OIL TAX BREAKS TO HELP NEW FIELDS - REVENUE Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oilproducers, announced today, are aimed at encouragingdevelopments in the North Sea to go ahead and boostopportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the InlandRevenue said in a post-budget statement.    Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announcedin his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companieswill be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifyingdevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields againstPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).    To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on anindividual field itself, when its income stream began, but wasnot immediately available against other developmentexpenditure, the statement said.    The new relief will apply to fields outside the southernbasin for which developmentconsent is first given on or after today, and will improve thepost-tax economics of new developments and encourage companiesto proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.    Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allowcertain expenditure on oil related research which does not atpresent qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRTliability.    This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on theU.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in aparticular field within three years of being incurred, to beallowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the InlandRevenue said.    This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs morein line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned toencourage general research into ways of reducing fielddevelopment costs, it said.    In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mlnstg a year, it calculated.    The Inland Revenue statement also included other technicalmeasures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.    These included measures to allow companies to balance theirshares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in twopast periods of allowance utilisation.    Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefswere announced, while there were also ammendments on rules oncorporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to theso-called "ring fence" of activities in the U.K. And itscontinental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions forthe implementation of measures announced in November, it said.    Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokersWood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefson PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.    He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief wouldfavour chances that development of smaller North Sea fieldssuch Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.    Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fieldsmight also be encouraged, he said.    Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshoreconstruction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offsunder the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.    He pointed out that the relief only applies to thedevelopment of new fields outside the Southern Basin.    This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in thecentral and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper thanin the south and thus have greater capital and labourrequirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.    He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditurewould help fundamental research in the oil industry, althoughthe benefits of this research would not be seen for severalyear. REUTER

U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL A White House-ordered report said that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000could have potentially damaging implications for nationalsecurity.    The Energy Department study discusses several options tocurb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruledout a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to helpthe depressed domestic oil industry.    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that"although we have made gains in energy security in the last sixyears, this report shows that there is justification fornational concern both over declining competitiveness of ourdomestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreignoil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing adetermination that the country never again become captive to aforeign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages andsharp prices increases of the 1970s.    The report said an import fee would raise prices and helpmake it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce newoil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax woulddepress the nation's economy. reuter
U.S OIL TAX WOULD NOT AFFECT PDVSA-CHAMPLIN DEAL an eventual oil import fee in theunited states will make no difference to champlin petroleumcorp's joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos devenezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said.    "this was an aspect which was discussed at length during thenegotiations, but we can say our contract covers alleventualities in this regard," he told reuters during thesigning ceremony here.    Venezuela's energy and mines minister arturo hernandezgrisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsabuys 50 pct of champlin's corpus christi refinery, as "one morestep in the maturation and presence of our oil industry inworld markets."   union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement willbe beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source ofsupply with a modern refinery and access to markets.    "we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a timeof protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there areclear benefits to both sides," he said.    Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even withan oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily overthe years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelanheavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities andobtain a competitive product yield.    "therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been aconsideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seenwhat such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impacton today's agreement," adams said.    He said the refinery could run crude as heavy asvenezuela's bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without anydifficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier dietto take advantage of bigger margins.    The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd ofvenezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pctyield of white products. Reuter

The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels aday.    Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill ratefor the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept downbecause of budgetary constraints.    Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he mightadvocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in taxbenefits for oil and gas exploration and for research anddevelopment into new ways to extract oil which is nowconsidered uneconomical to produce.    He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of theEnergy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.    Herrington said that before he disclosed whatrecommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industryhe might make, he would raise the matter with the White HouseEconomic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increaseoil production made good tax policy.

U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88 The U.K. Government forecasts that oilrevenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in1985/86.    The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement andBudget Report issued after the Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.    The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oilrevenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remainingclose to current levels, the Treasury document said.    The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall willreflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporationtax is paid after a time lag.    The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel differencein oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mlnstg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a fullyear.    Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes inproduction would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.    Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are nowestimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.    Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billionstg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of theovershoot.    Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.    Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion thisfiscal year.    The general government expenditure for the coming fiscalyear is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised164.9 billion in the current year.    A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market andoverseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total PublicSector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasurysaid.

MALAYSIA TO CUT OIL OUTPUT FURTHER, TRADERS SAY Malaysia's state oil company Petronaswill cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) fromMay 1, trade sources said.    Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct lastSeptember to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latestcut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level.    Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.    However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual reportthat Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to anaverage 510,000 bpd in 1987.    The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude pricesat 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permitfurther production cutbacks, the sources said.    Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bblthis year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.    Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add tothe tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reducedIndonesian and Chinese crude output.    The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, asthere is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases dueto the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.    In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering twoto three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each monthfor sale through tender, the sources said.    However, this practice is likely to dwindle given thereduced scale of production, they said.

NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO CLOSE REFINERY - ESSO SAF ESSO SAF <ESSF.PA>, the French subsidiaryof Exxon Corp <XON>, said it had no immediate plans to shutdown one of its two refineries. Exxon's new president Lee R.Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a Frenchrefinery.    An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis thatdepended on the evolution of the market and refineries' abilityto make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos surMer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investmentover 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.    The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacityof seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, thespokesman added.    Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of wouldbe Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the PortJerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising apetrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.    Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview thatExxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and mightdecide to close one of its French refineries. Reuter

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY Higher world oil prices, coupled with anew realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia'seconomy after five years of falling revenue and growing budgetdeficits, bankers and diplomats said.    The months ahead will prove critical as the governmentattempts a balancing act between defending higher oil pricesand fostering recovery through a bigger role for the privatesector.    Economists said oil earnings could recover this year toabout 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product couldgrow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.    But the economists said this will be possible only if theOrganisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeedsin defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forcedto curtail output for too long.    Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defendOPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.    Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running atabout three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on SaudiArabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.    King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC'snew-found determination to defend prices in a move Westerndiplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure astable source of income for its economy.    Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is ahugely wealthy country. But the past five years of decliningrevenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate grossdomestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.    Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billiondlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.    "Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will notbe allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis canafford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worsteffects," a diplomat said.    In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact oflower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing onforeign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.    But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankersand diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness inthe longer term.    It also increases the dominance of the public sector at atime when the government is publicly urging private enterpriseto take over the lead role in the economy.    Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware ofthe risks attached to this policy but is determined to "tough itout" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletionof reserves.    The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billionriyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitlyrecognises the need to draw down reserves while foreignborrowing has been ruled out.    Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudibusinessmen this week the government had carefully consideredthe need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budgetplans late last year.    "It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into theeconomy," he said.    Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction andtales of high spending became legendary.    The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in thefabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor managementhad gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.    Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced,markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cutback. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.    The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining butSaudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporatesector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.    Government moves to encourage lending and investigatecompany complaints about late public sector contract paymentscould boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation'sindustrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.    Private wealth is still very high and banks report more andmore cash being placed on deposit.    As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economicdevelopment from the public to the private sector, one of thebiggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channelpersonal savings into industrial projects within the kingdomand refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

U.S. ENERGY CHIEF SEES PROMISE IN OIL-TAX CHANGE Energy Secretary John Herringtonsaid his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowanceto 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way tospur domestic production.    The White House has said it would consider the optionalthough it was generally opposed to any revisions in the newtax code.    Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and GasAssociation that the higher depletion allowance on new oil andenhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs ayear.    The option was one of many contained in a report on oil andthe national security the Energy Department sent to the WhiteHouse on Tuesday.    Herrington said of the increased depletion allowanceoption: "that is one that could significantly increaseproduction at a very low cost to the American taxpayer."

API SAYS U.S. CRUDE OIL OUPUT OFF FROM YEAR AGO The American Petroleum Institutesaid that U.S. crude oil production in February declined 9.8pct from year-ago levels to about 8.3 mln barrels a day.    In its monthly report on U.S. oil supplies and stocks, APIsaid that domestic demand for petroleum products, as measuredby products supplied, continued to rise reaching 16.3 mlnbarrels a day in the month, up 1.5 pct from February 1986.    API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with adrop in natural gas liquids production, which was off 11 pctfrom February 1986 levels, represented a decline in U.S.production of more than one mln barrels a day.    API said the decline in domestic production and the rise indemand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a dayin February, a 30.3 pct increase from last year's level.    So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, whichwas up 2.9 pct from last year's year-to-date level, has slowedin comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of1986.    It said crude oil production for the first two months of1987 was off 8.6 pct from the comparable year-ago period whilecrude imports were up 30.6 pct. Reuter
UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS The "cross field allowance" relief onPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRTpaying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.    The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct ofqualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability ofother fields. It is restricted to new offshore developmentsoutside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.    A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field notpaying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directlybenefit in PRT saving on an existing field.    "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participatorsin those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said,adding that the timing of development of such fields may beadvanced.    The government would in effect be subsidising thesedevelopments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure beforecorporation tax, the report said.    On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit isof timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields willbe reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields willrise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.    In a study on probable fields, the report said that whenthe rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-payingfield such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in theU.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for asmall non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9pct.    The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there willbe a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not onlywill these costs be unavailable for offset against the field'sfuture profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs willbe lost.    Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development startswill have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a latertime. Reuter

WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA World Bank President Barber Conable isexpected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largestdebtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes totackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.    Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, willmeet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.    He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia'slargest nation was being managed well, but the slump in worldoil prices called for major policy adjustments.    Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projectsin the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populousisland. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detaileddiscussions with ministers tomorrow.    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severelyhit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil andgas revenues in half.    Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed toprovide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesiapay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.    Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded tothe oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans tobridge its deficit.    Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suhartoand leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policychange, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-costprotected economy.    "Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all callfor major policy adjustments and external support," Conable saidin his arrival statement.    But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections nextmonth, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply thatthe Bank is demanding specific changes.    "We believe there has been wise leadership here and theeconomy is being very well managed," Conable told reporters atJakarta airport.    Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it theThird World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.    Conable did not spell out what further changes he wouldlike to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changesalready introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.    Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support,the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of thegovernment's trade reform measures, and supported itsdetermination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.    Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since lastMay to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourageoutside investment.    Suharto has also ordered a government committee to lookinto which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could besold.    But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said thegovernment appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.    Western analysts say that in particular the government isunsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-costmonopolies, which control core areas of the economy.    Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week thatIndonesia faced very limited economic choices.    It could not spend its way out of trouble because thiswould increase the balance of payments deficit and domesticinflation.     He said the main objective was to raise exports outsidethe oil and natural gas sector.    Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by thegovernment to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financialyear which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in1986/87. REUTER

AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES The government'sover-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affectingAustralia's economic performance, Australian PetroleumExploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.    Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income isderived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weakcrude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.    This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts thecountry's economic performance directly by acting as adisincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affectingtrading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.    Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiencyposition is posing a major economic threat, yet thegovernment's response has been to load new tax burdens on theoil industry, Benbow said.    Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected tofall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of theBass Strait fields, he said.    Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with thethree largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.    By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just overhalf the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undevelopedfields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery fromexisting fields goes ahead, Benbow said.    Government projections of output from as yet undiscoveredfields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.    Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying acrude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five yearstime, he said.    At present world oil prices and the current value of theAustralian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would costbetween 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.    Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, theaddition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.    For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the fiveyears 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said.    He called on the government to review its tax policies torestore incentive to exploration. REUTER
EXXON OFFICIAL URGES PLANNING FOR NEXT OIL SURGE World governmentsshould prepare for an inevitable significant increase in theprice of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp<XON> director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said.    Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulkof world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in aspeech prepared for delivery to the Australian PetroleumExploration Association (APEA) annual conference.    It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewherewill not change this fact, he said.    McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields containabout 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.    Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside theMiddle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in thelast 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.    He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at therate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.    More than half of remaining proved reserves are in theMiddle East, he said.    McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oiloutside the Middle East because each addition contributes to adiversity of supply desirable for global political and economicstability.    "It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-countrydiscoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stabletaxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up ofacreage for exploration," he said.    Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost theincentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources ofpetroleum, he added. REUTER
AUSTRALIAN OIL TAX CUT SEEN BOOSTING OUTPUT A 10 percentagepoint reduction in the Australian government's maximum crudeoil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output,resources analyst Ian Story said here.    A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Straitoutput to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrelsper day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum ExplorationAssociation annual conference.    Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydneystockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.    Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longerappropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.    The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discoveredbefore September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty CoLtd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-inproduction, accelerating the decline in output and reducinggovernment revenue, he said.    He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrsif the levy was cut to 70 pct.    "The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractiveat oil prices below 30 dlrs," Story said.    Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higherlevels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boostexports and provide incentives for exploration and development,he said.    The government is currently reviewing the oil taxstructure. REUTER

"On the supply side, the argument in favor of a contingent,variable import tariff is most persuasive," Krapels, presidentof Energy Security Analysis, Inc said in a statement at a HouseEnergy and Power subcommittee hearing.    "An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if theinternational price of crude oil falls below, say, 15 dlrs abarrel. On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise taxon transportation fuels," Krapels said.    But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with theoil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove pricecontrols on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oilcompanies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide taxincentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserveexisiting tax incentives for drilling. He also urging fillingthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate.    Richard Adkerson of Arthur Andersen and Co told thesubcommittee oil imports were expected to increase becausefunds for exploration and development of domestic oil sourcescannot now be economically justified due to low oil prices.

IRAQ REPLACES OIL MINISTER IN BIG GOVT SHUFFLE Iraqi President Saddam Hussein carriedout his first major government shakeup in five years tonight,naming a new oil minister in shuffling three posts.    One minister was dropped in the shuffle, announced in apresidential decree. It gave no reason for the changes in thegovernment of the Arab Baath Socialist Party which has ruledIraq since a revolution in 1968.    The decree named the head of the Iraqi National Oil Company(INOC), Isam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalaby, to take over as oilminister replacing Qassem Ahmed Taqi.    Taqi, appointed oil minister in the last significantgovernment reorganization in 1982, was moved to be minister ofheavy industries. Reuter
HUGHES' U.S. RIG COUNT RISES TO 784 U.S. drilling activity rose last weekwith the number of working rotary rigs up by 23 to 784, against1,063 working rigs one year ago, Hughes Tool Co. said.    The improvement was the first increase this year in theweekly rig count, which had dropped steadily since earlyJanuary when a total of 962 rotary rigs were working.    Among individual states, Texas and Oklahoma reported thebiggest gains in drilling last week with increases of 21 and11, respectively. California and Louisiana were each up bythree and Wyoming gained two additional working rigs.    Hughes Tool said it counted a total of 692 rigs drilling onland, 74 rigs active offshore and 18 drilling in inland waters.In Canada, the rig count was up by two to 183, against 324 oneyear ago.

AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SEES TARGETED OIL TAX STRATEGY Australia's crudeoil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of atargeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resourcesand Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.    He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association(APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing apackage that would recognise the government's economicpriorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns.    Evans was referring to a nearly completed government reviewof oil taxation.    Evans said there were plenty of examples where targetedapproaches to oil industry taxation had produced good resultsin recent years.    These include the reduction in the top marginal crudeexcise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshoreoil announced last September, he said.    The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for theelimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boostincentives for prospecting against a background of weak pricesand Australia's relatively low exploration levels.    "While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity toan already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favourthese kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes,which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may stillleave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies aregoing to do in major areas," Evans said.    He said the government did not intend to change itsresource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now beforeparliament, in response to industry calls to allow allexploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.    As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited tohighly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after acertain rate of return has been achieved for individualprojects.    APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax becauseexploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.    Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based morethan anything on the government's desire to ensure thecertainty and stability of the new regime, adding that majorinvestments have already been planned on the existing groundrules.

AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TAX CAMPAIGN The council of theAustralian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said itwill press on with its campaign for major improvements toAustralia's petroleum taxation structure.    The council said in a statement the industry was bitterlydisappointed by the Australian government's position ontaxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and EnergyMinister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.    As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to targetany tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach tosecondary taxation of petroleum.    APEA had expected the government to make positive responsesto detailed industry submissions seeking the removal ofexisting secondary tax disincentives to exploration anddevelopment, the council said.    It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised byEvans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceedwith the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.    Evans told the conference the government did not plan toaccept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allowdeductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.    "The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction ofunsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshorearea in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax isprofit based," the APEA council said.    The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oilexploration companies that it had realistic answers to theindustry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry'sproblems, the council said.    The industry has called for the end of all discriminatorysecondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as majordisincentives at a time of low oil prices. REUTER

SHELL TO DECLARE NORWAY'S DRAUGEN FIELD COMMERCIAL <A/S Norske Shell>, RoyalDutch/Shell Group's <RD.AS> Norwegian subsidiary, said it hasnearly concluded a 10 billion crown development scheme forNorway's Draugen oil field and will declare the fieldcommercial in the near future.    Pending government approval of the scheme, the field couldcome on stream in 1992, making it Norway's northermost fielddevelopment and the first such project on the Haltenbankentract off central Norway.    Work on the project could begin as early as January 1988, aShell spokesman said.    Shell has not released projected output levels for thefield, where water depth is 240-270 meters.    The spokesman said the field's partners have agreed todevelop Draugen with a 300-meter, single-leg concretegravity-base platform.    The scheme also proposes using remote subsea productionwells to tap the field's reservoir, estimated to contain 375mln barrels of oil, and an offshore buoy-loading system totransport oil from the field by ship.    Partners on Draugen are Shell, the operator, with a 30 pctstake, British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> unit <BP PetroleumDevelopment (Norway) Ltd> (20 pct) and state-owned Den NorskeStats Oljeselskap A/S <STAT.OL> (Statoil) (50 pct).

U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY OPTIMISTIC ON INCENTIVES U.S. Department of Energy SecretaryJohn Herrington said he was "optimistic" about the chances ofproviding a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gasproducers, but added that the plan faces strong opposition fromsome members of the Reagan administration.    Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at abreakfast meeting, said administration debate over his plan fora 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was "heavy and strong"largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry couldeventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as theagriculture industry.    Herrington's proposed tax incentives for the oil industrywere issued last week after the Department of Energy released acomprehensive report finding U.S. national security could bejeopardized by rising oil imports.    In response to a question from Mitchell Energy andDevelopment Corp <MND> chairman, George Mitchell, Herringtonsaid the report did not definitively rule out an oil importtarrif. "We intend to keep that debate open," Herrington said.    However, following his speech, Herrington told Reuters thatthe new report shows an oil import fee "is not economical."    Herrington said, for example, a 10 dlr per barrel tariff onoil imports would cause the nation's gross national product todrop by as much as 32 billion dlrs.    Herrington also said he believed President Reagan, whorequested the comprehensive national security study, wascommitted to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry.    "I'm quite confident he understands the problems and isprepared to do something about it," Herrington said. Reuter
OIL TAX BREAK RIDICULED BY U.S. HOUSE TAXWRITER A House taxwriter said EnergySecretary James Herrington's "outrageous" plan to restore an oldtax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy.    Rep. Pete Stark, a California Democrat and senior HouseWays and Means Committee member, said Herrington's plan for a27.5 pct depletion allowance--which in effect is a special 27.5pct tax deduction --would cost seven billion dlrs a year.    "He must have missed the last two years of federal taxreform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle," Stark said.    He said in a statement the oil industry already pays aneffective lower rate of U.S. tax on investment, 15 pct versusaggregate corporate tax on all investment of 34 pct, accordingto a recent Congressional Research Service study.

ABU DHABI TO REOPEN GULF OILFIELD HIT IN 1986 RAID Abu Dhabi's offshore Abu al-Bukhooshoilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack lastNovember, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences areready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industrysources said.    They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaisedes Petroles (Total) <TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhooshsubsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on thereopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.    Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi,last November 25.    The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main livingquarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main productionplatform.    Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsiblebut Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.    Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd)at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resumeat a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff andthe fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.    The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed inremaining accomodations, the sources said.    Facilities being installed to protect the field includeaircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housingfor military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sourcessaid.    Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United ArabEmirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15mln bpd production, the sources said.    They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field,part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located onlya few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi airraid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked. REUTER
OIL ANALYST SEES PAPUA NEW GUINEA AS GOOD PROSPECT Papua New Guinea(PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in theAsia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst FereidunFesharaki said here.    The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNGon the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he toldthe Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annualconference.    Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-WestCenter in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacificpetroleum outlook.    With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd)and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991,PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharakisaid.    The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the bestoil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG.    The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paperdistributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves atabout 500 mln barrels.    PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region withno secondary taxes, Fesharaki said.    "We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, anddiscovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to(light) Bass Strait crude," Fesharaki said.    There are also large pockets of high quality condensates tobe produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which iscapable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.    But prices should be somewhat higher than the presentlevels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.    The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five largeprospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG. REUTER

THATCHER DEFENDS UK OIL POLICY IN SAUDI INTERVIEW British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherdenied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that hergovernment's oil policy contributed to weakness in world oilprices.    She said the government was determined not to intervene toinfluence production decisions by oil companies operating inthe North Sea.    "We believe these must be a matter for the commercialjudgment of the oil companies," she told the Arabic languagedaily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visitto London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.    Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fallin oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same asin 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel.    British production was on a plateau and was unlikely toincrease in the future, she said.    "We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and otherOPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatilityfor both producer and consumer countries," Thatcher said.

CANADA SETS OIL INDUSTRY AID PACKAGE Canada's federal governmentwill provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package thatincludes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of acompany's oil and gas exploration and development costs, EnergyMinister Marcel Masse announced.    The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year intothe oil and gas industry and could lead to more than onebillion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.    The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada onor after April 1, 1987.    Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aidpackage is aimed at small and medium sized companies.    The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration andDevelopment Incentive Program, will restrict the total paymentsthat any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.    Masse said the program will probably generate newemployment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.    He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration anddevelopment spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oilprices fell during the first half of 1986.    Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decidedto provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax payingcompanies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the fullvalue of the incentive. Such companies would not immediatelybenefit from tax benefits, he said.    The federal government also wanted to deliver an aidprogram outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilsonis now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce taxreform proposals later this spring.    An important feature of the aid program is a decision tolet companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors tobenefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits toonly participating companies, he said.    Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make iteasier for companies to attract investors in exploration anddevelopment, Masse said.    He told reporters his department is still consideringwhether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify forthe subsidy. Reuter

BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES The Emirates Industrial Bank haspredicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab statesfollowing higher oil revenues.    A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, saidtotal oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from33.5 billion in 1986.    The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabiaand the United Arab Emirates (UAE).    The bank said the improvement would result from higher oilprices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrainoverall group production.    These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eightdollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.    "All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery inthe economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expectedgrowth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,"the study said.    It added, however, that GCC states would experience higherbudget deficits this year because of needs arising from pastrecession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.    The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would riseto 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.    It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combinedtrade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in1985.    The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic productto 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, itadded. REUTER

A communique broadcast on Saturday evening said food priceswould rise on average by 9.3 pct, petrol, gas and electricityby 25 pct and coal by 50 pct.    The immediate increases will be followed by a rise of 10pct in the cost of meat from April 1. Some postal charges willgo up 100 pct next month and rail and bus fares by 30 pct inOctober.    The government said its annual plan for the economy hadspecified a 13 pct increase in food prices this year.    "Economic reasoning calls for greater price rises than thosewhich have been announced ... The government has taken aneconomic risk in accepting a portion of the trades unions'demands," the communique said.    The National Trade Union Alliance (OPZZ), which claimsseven million members, warned earlier this month it would fightefforts to impose the original range of price rises. It saidthe rises would badly affect the lower paid and the old,despite government pledges to protect their purchasing power.

CRUDE OIL NETBACKS UP IN U.S., MEDITERRANEAN Crude oil netback values in complexrefineries rose slightly in the U.S. and the Mediterranean last Friday from the previous week but were lower elsewhere,according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.    The soft tone to refining margins reflects large worldwidestocks of petroleum products and thin trading activity, traderssaid.    In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by as much as26 cts a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, an increase of 1.4pct from the previous Friday, while sour crudes, such asAlaska North Slope, were up one pct.    In the Mediterranean, netback values were up 17 cts to 22cts a barrel, with Arab Light up 17 cts a barrel to 18.62 dlrs,a 0.9 pct increase from the previous Friday and Urals were up22 cts a barrel to 19.16 dlrs, a 1.2 pct increase.    But netbacks for crude oil refined in Northern Europe wasgenerally lower with Brent valued at 18.89 dlrs, off 30 ctsfrom the previous friday, and Bonny Light was off 17 cts to19.58 dlrs a barrel.    Refinery netbacks in Singapore were also lower, withheavier and sour crudes weakest. Arab Heavy dropped 10 cts to16.63 dlrs a barrel and Dubai was off 12 cts to 18.09 dlrs.

VENEZUELA WANTS TO BOOST ITS REFINING CAPACITY Venezuela's state oilcompany Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. wants to raise itsworldwide refining capacity by 150,000 barrels of per day, acompany official attending the National Petroleum RefinersAssociation meeting here said.    He declined to be identified but said PdVSA has thecapacity to refine about 650,000 bpd of crude oil from refiningcentersin Venezuela, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, and the UnitedStates. The company recently purchased a 50 pct stake in theCorpus Christi, Texas refinery of Champlin Petroleum Co, asubsidiary of Union Pacific Corp <UNP>.    Earlier it bought a similar stake in the Lake Charles, Larefinery owned by Citgo Petroleum Corp, a unit of SouthlandCorp <SLC>.     According to the official, Venezuela is searchingworldwide for the additional refining capacity but he did notmention where the company was looking.     Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet forVenezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply torefiners.    He said Venezuela currently  produces about 1.4 mln bpd ofcrude oil, which is in line with its 1.495 bpd OPEC ceiling. Reuter

EXXON (XON) SEES SYNFUELS ROLE BY YEAR 2000 Development of costly shale oil,liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted inrecent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies,will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs abarrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said.    Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters afteraddressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute ofChemical Engineers, "By early in the next century, syntheticsshould play a significant role in this country's energysupply."    McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that hebelieved synthetic fuels would become economic to develop whenworld oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range.    "You're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oilprices, but I think that time is coming and we've got to beprepared," McMillan said.    He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pctannually in the next few years while the nation fails toreplace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn ofthe century, world oil prices will be significantly higherbecause of declining supplies, McMillan said.    Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at themeeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to helpspur development of synthetic fuels.    The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tonsof demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple thatof all the world's known oil reserves.    "We must encourage research now in order to make synfuelscompetitive later," Hall said. The average lead time fordevelopment of a shale oil or liquified coal project is betweenfive and ten years.    Until last year, the federal government had subsidizedsynfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., aresearch program created during the Carter Administration withthe goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrelsof oil.    The corporation was shut down last April when Congressrefused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budgetbecause of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs abarrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.

U.S. SHOULD REASSESS MIDEAST POLICY - ANALYST The U.S. should reassessits Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence onimported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center forStrategic and International Studies.     "The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from theGulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commissionreport, mandate more than ever before the need for afundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,"Ebinger said.     He remarks were made in an address to the NationalPetroleum Refiners Association meeting.     "Although in the short run it is difficult to see a directlink between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in thecurrent environment it will be increasingly difficult formoderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S.interests," Ebinger said.     Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crudeoil prices strong recently although some believe prices will beweaker if demand falls in the spring.    But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, saidcrude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring.    There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking atthe annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chancethat crude oil prices could move higher in the second half ofthe year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June.    He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreementto restrict production.    OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in Junebecause the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  hasdeclined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said.    OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollarhas fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.    Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 tofour mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 totwo mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd. Reuter

TREASURY'S BAKER SEES REAGAN OPPOSING OIL TAX Treasury Secretary James Baker toldthe House Appropriations Committee that he believes thepresident remains opposed to an oil import fee.    He said Reagan last year rejected the idea and he added:    "In my personal view he is not likely to change his thinkingon that."    He said Reagan last year opposed the idea because theenergy industry was divided on the issue, a tax would require anew bureacracy to administer and the resulting higher energyprices would harm U.S. competitiveness.

U.S. OFFICIALS DEFEND OIL RESERVE SALE PLAN Treasury Secretary James Baker andOffice of Management and Budget chief James Miller defended anadministration plan to sell the U.S. Naval Petroleum Reserves.    In response to hostile questioning from a member of theHouse Appropriations Committee, the officials said the plan wasjustified to help bring the fiscal 1988 budget deficit and toget the government out of the oil business.    Miller acknowleged the estimated sale proceeds at 3.3billion dlrs would actually bring down the deficit by about 2.2billion dlrs because of the loss of revenues from the sale ofoil from the reserves.    Miller said the sale price may end up higher.    "We'd sell it to the highest bidder," Miller said.    "If we can get more we'll take it." Reuter

IMPERIAL OIL <IMO.A> IN TALKS WITH SUPPLIERS Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct-owned by ExxonCorp <XON>, is negotiating with it major crude oil suppliersconcerning the effects of a trial deregulation of Alberta'sshut-in crude oil production, scheduled to be implemented onJune 1, a company spokesman said.    "From our point of view, it's a question of entering intonegotiations or discussions to make appropriate changes tocontracts to reflect the changes that are going to take placeon June 1," spokesman John Cote told Reuters in reply to aquery.    Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspendedits oil supply contracts, Cote said: "It's not a question ofcancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point."    On June 1, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Boardwill lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system,regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on atrial basis to the end of 1987.    Under the new system, producers and refiners will beallowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be deliveredunder purchase contracts.    Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount ofoil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners.    "We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, andwe've discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing hasbeen finalized," Imperial's manager of western crude supply GaryStrong said.    Under Alberta's trial system, Imperial wants to match areasonable supply of crude against the company's forecastdemand for its refineries, Strong said.    "We have to know what they have and how that relates to whatwe need in total," he said.    Strong said figures on the amount of crude productionImperial purchases from outside suppliers were not immediatelyavailable. Reuter

STANDARD OIL RAISES ALASKA NORTH SLOPE BY 1.50 DLRS, effective A The International Monetary Fundpredicts that the industrial world will grow a sluggish 2.5 pctin 1987, a sharp drop from the more than three pct forecast sixmonths ago, monetary sources said.    The forecasts, prepared by the IMF staff, will form thebasis of a debate on economic policy coordination by officialsof top industrial nations at high-level meetings next week.    The sources said the IMF predicts an expansion of just 2.5pct in the U.S., shaving a full one point off its original 1987forecast, released last fall.    The figures will be discussed by the IMF's executive boardbefore going to the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee herenext week and may be subject to slight revision, they said.    The Reagan administration has forecast 3.2 pct U.S.economic growth this year while more pessimistic Fed officialsare predicting 2.5 to three pct.    The sources said the IMF also predicts growth of around 2.5 pct in West Germany, and 2.8 pct in Japan.    Washington has extracted promises from both West Germanyand Japan that they will take measures to bolster theirdomestic economic growth, to help reduce the massive gapbetween their huge trade surpluses and the record Americantrade deficit.    Poor economic growth figures in these two nations and theU.S. are likely to do little to reassure currency markets.    In recent days, the dollar has come under heavy sellingpressure as markets have grown cynical that Bonn and Tokyo willtake early action.    With no economic stimulus in sight, financial markets havereduced the dollar's value to levels that are more likely tobalance U.S. trade, monetary analysts say.    Monetary sources also said the IMF forecasts overall growthin developing nations of around three pct this year, withdeveloping countries in the western hemisphere -- theCaribbean, Central and South America -- expanding 3.3 pct.    In its recent annual report, the Inter-American DevelopmentBank said Latin American nations need to expand between fourand five pct this year to service their 382 billion dlrs offoreign debt.    Non-oil exporting Third World nations should achieve anexpansion of around four per cent while oil exporting nationswill average almost no growth at all, the sources said.    Also short of the mark is the level of industrial countrygrowth. Western officials maintain the industrial world needsto expand at least three per cent annually -- against thisyear's initial IMF prediction of 2.5 pct -- in order to supportthe export drive of debtor nations.    Exports provide the indebted world, which owes westerncreditors some 900 billion dlrs, with its principal source offoreign exchange for debt repayments.    In other forecasts, the IMF put overall global growth atabout 2.8 pct and output in the seven leading industrialnations at around 2.5 pct.    The seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany,Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- have become the main forumfor coordination of medium-term economic policies in theindustrial world. The prediction for the seven is also around2.5 pct growth in 1987.    The Fund put Canadian growth at about 2.7 pct, the Frenchexpansion at 2.9 pct and Britain at 2.8 pct.    The figures will be discussed as part of an overall debateon the World Economic Outlook and the U.S. debt strategy by theInterim Committee.    Those talks are one of several meetings between topeconomic officials of industrial and developing nations duringthe semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. Reuter
MOBIL RAISES WEST COAST CRUDE PRICES BETWEEN ONE The Energy Department issued aninvitation for site proposals from states or others for its 4.4billion dlr Super Conducting Supercollider atom smasher.

Among the states already waging campaigns are California,Colorado, Illinois, Ohio, Texas, Utah and Washington.    A "preferred" site will be selected by July 1988 and thefinal site decision made in January 1989.    Congress has not yet appropriated money for the project,but if it accepts President Reagan's plan, construction wouldbegin later in 1989 at a spending rate of about 600 mln dlrs ayear.

AMOCO <AN> SEES 1ST QTR NET TOPPING 4TH QTR Amoco Corp first quarter profits areexpected to exceed the 165 mln dlrs, or 65 cts per share,reported for 1986's fourth quarter, chairman Richard Morrowsaid.    Speaking to reporters after a security analyst meeting, hesaid the gain was expected because of higher oil and gasprices, but declined to compare his expectations with the 331mln dlrs, or 1.28 dlrs per share, the company earned in 1986'sfirst quarter.    Earlier, Morrow told the analysts that Amoco's firstquarter refining and marketing results "will look pretty poor,"because of low margins in January and February. The marginsbegan to improve last month and look pretty good now, he added.    Morrow said he expects oil product margins to remain goodfor the rest of the year, "but it remains to be seen if theywill match 1986 levels." The Amoco chairman said he expectscrude oil prices to remain in the 17 to 20 dlr barrel range forthe rest of 1988 based on his belief that OPEC's agreement willhold.    Morrow said his best estimate for 1989 crude oil prices is21 dlrs per barrel, adding he believes this price level wouldresult in a 40 pct increase in oil company explorationspending.    President H. Lawrance Fuller told the analysts Amocoreduced its estimates of worldwide oil and gas reserves by atotal of 201 mln equivalent barrels last year because of a dropin oil and gas prices.    Noting the Securities and Exchange Commission requires thatreserves be estimated on the assumption that year-end priceswill remain fixed for the life of the properties, he said thedrop in oil prices to 16 dlrs a barrel at the end of 1986 from27 dlrs a year earlier forced the company to reduce its reserveestimate by four pct.    Fuller said Amoco expects its U.S. oil and natural gasliquids production to decline about five pct this year fromlast year's 121 mln barrels because of drilling deferrals madelast year when oil prices were falling.    He said the full impact of the deferrals was off-set by thepurchase of properties which will add about 5,000 barrels perday to the company's 1987 U.S. production.    Fuller said U.S. refining capacity is expected to beincreasingly strained by the rising demand for lead-freegasoline, especially the higher octane grades.    He said expected federal regulations on gasoline vaporpressure will further tighten the industry's gasolineproduction capacity. Reuter
CLOSURE OF BP SWEDEN REFINERY FORECAST A Swedish Finance Ministry committeeforecast that British Petroleum Plc <BP.L> may have to closeits refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worseningof the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness.    It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refiningbusiness was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oilconsumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of ruleson sulphur content and competition from Norway's Mongstadfacility of <Den Norske Stats Olieselskab> (Statoil) <STAT.OL>when its expansion is completed in the 1990s.    The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks ade-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unlesscostly investments were made to enhance the facility's capacityto refine a broader range of products.    But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had inrecent years been above that of the European refining industryon average.

CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS Firmer crude oil prices, government aidpackages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oilindustry recover from last year sharp downturn, industryanalysts said.    They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices droppedabout 50 pct.    On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared totheir highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading atrecord highs.    "This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on thepart of the investment community that the outlook for theindustry for the future is extremely attractive," Peters and CoLtd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.    Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies,culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of lastyear's results, analysts said.    "But the financial statements are a snap shot and arecording of history. The stock market is the indication of thefuture," Gobert commented.    The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15at the end of 1986.    Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares ofImperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, istrading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.    Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4.Texaco Canada Inc <TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc <TX>, isat 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.    Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecastsoperating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gascompanies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrsand operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billiondlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S.dlrs a barrel. "However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs abarrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increasewith cash flow 27 pct higher," analyst Plexman said.    "Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of theprofit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,"he added.    Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, whenoperating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90billion dlrs.    But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will holdrecent gains and more government assistance is needed.    Canadian Petroleum Association technical director HansMaciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987,after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crudeoil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPECproduction accord will continue to support prices.    However, several companies share the optimistic industryoutlook expressed by a majority of analysts.    Shell Canada and <Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecastimproved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued thisweek, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.    "The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but notrobust," Texaco Canada said in its annual report.    "While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there isgood reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,continued volatility is likely," Texaco Canada added.    In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies havepared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels,deferring most frontier exploration work.    "The industry is becoming very selective in investments,very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,"Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said.    Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushionthe industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.    The most significant help came last September when thefederal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax(PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.    Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oilcompanies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.    The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flowdecline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented furtherexploration spending cuts, analysts said.

COLOMBIA'S MAIN OIL PIPELINE ATTACKED State-run oil company Ecopetrol saidColombia's main oil pipeline was bombed again and pumping of170,000 barrels per day was suspended.    A spokeswoman for the company said that the early morningdynamite attack was the 31st in the last nine months on theCano Limon-Covenas pipeline, which links Colombia's biggestoilfied at Cravo Norte to the Caribbean.    She said about 2,000 barrels of crude were spilled andcould not indicate when pumping would resume. The attack wasnear Magangue in northeastern Bolivar province.    Ecopetrol is exploiting Cravo Norte in association withOccidental Petroleum Corp <OXY> and Shell Petroleum N.V., aunit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <ST>.    Ecopetrol said in a communique that bombings since lastJuly led to a loss of more than 110,000 barrels of crude, orthe equivalent of 10 mln dlrs. Reuter
BRAZIL MAKES SECOND AMAZON OIL DISCOVERY The Brazilian state oil companyPetrobras has made a second oil discovery in the Amazon region,President Jose Sarney said.    He said the well had an initial flow of 150,000 cubicmeters of gas and 220 barrels of oil per day. It is situated 14kilometres from the first well to be discovered in the regionlast year, which is currently yielding 500,000 cubic meters ofgas and 900 barrels of oil daily.    The wells, the biggest onshore well in the country, are onthe banks of the river Uruc in the Amazon basin 3,600kilometres (2,250 miles) north of Brasilia. Reuter
UAE OIL PRODUCTION DROPS TEN PCT IN MARCH Oil output in the United Arab Emirates(UAE) dropped ten pct in March from February to an average 1.05mln barrels per day (bpd), mainly because of customerresistance to fixed prices of Abu Dhabi oil, industry sourcessaid.    The UAE quota assigned by the Organisation of PetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC) is 902,000 bpd. Traders could buyAbu Dhabi's Umm Shaif crude on the spot market for 17.50 dlrs abarrel yesterday, against the official OPEC price of 17.72dlrs.    The sources said output by Abu Dhabi, the largest UAEproducer, fell to around 700,000 bpd from a range of800,000-820,000 bpd during the preceding four months.    Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd fromaround 370,000 in February after the emirate declared amid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, thesources added.    Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaifand Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixedprices too high and cut liftings, the sources said.    The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japaneseterm buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, theyadded. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of itMurban.    Abu Dhabi considers output from Upper Zakum, which came onstream in 1983, to be test production not included incalculations for complying with the OPEC quota.    Without Upper Zakum, the UAE would be producing roughly itsquota in March, the sources added. REUTER
IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND Growth in oil consumption in the Westernindustrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pctthis year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the InternationalEnergy Agency (IEA) said.    Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by aroundone pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said inits Monthly Oil Market Report.    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily fromtransport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices arehigher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may bebelow last year's 3.6 pct, it said.    The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product pricesstay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users canbe expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain someof the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and theremay be slightly less growth in transport fuels.    IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.    The agency said this flat trend is explained by theprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter ofthe year which offset a reduction in stocks.    It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fellby 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of theyear. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd buta decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.    It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reportedstocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonneson April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments builtup strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in theperiod.    The year-on-year trend of government stock building iscontinuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, moreor less in line with consumption, after declining for fiveyears, the IEA noted.    Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,respectively.    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to94 days of consumption.    World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mlnbpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crudeproduction to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports fromcentrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.    Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the firstquarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpdof crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln averagefor the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was thelargest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEAsaid.    Saudi Arabia"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd. REUTER
IEA FORECASTS SLOWER GROWTH IN OECD OIL DEMAND Growth in oil consumption in the Westernindustrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pctthis year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the InternationalEnergy Agency said.

And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,particulary for March, it said.    As crude production also fell, there is likely to have alsobeen a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, theIEA said.    World oil supply fell through the first quarter by abouttwo bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crudeproduction to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpdin January and to the seasonal drop in exports from CentrallyPlanned Economies, the IEA said.    Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the firstquarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three monthsof 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd asagainst 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largestfactor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. Reuter

ENIM OIL SIGNS CONTRACT WITH INDONESIA'S PERTAMINA <Enim Oil Co Ltd>, a wholly ownedsubsidiary of <Southern Cross Ltd> of Colorado, signed aproduction sharing contract with Indonesia's state oil companyPertamina to explore for oil in the Lematang block of Sumatra.    It was the second production sharing contract signed byPertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986.    The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presenceof Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oilproduction split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour.    Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mlndlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first twoyears.    The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oilproducing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials saidthere is a good chance of getting a high return on investment.    A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilledbefore, was neglected because it is deeper than surroundingblocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have nowmade seismic survey possible.    The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contractPertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February.    Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina'sfavour with operational costs deducted.    Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil'sproduction share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interestin the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it findsoil.    Enim must also set aside 28.57 pct of its crude forrefining in Indonesia if its share exceeds 150,000 barrels aday. REUTER
OIL PRICES SEEN HOLDING STEADY IN SECOND QUARTER Japanese oil traders generally expect oilprices to remain steady through June, when the nextOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec) meetingis scheduled to take place.    Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than amonth, despite coming under considerable pressure in Februaryas Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks stronglyresist paying official prices, trade sources said.    Despite these attempts, spot crude rose steadily tostabilize around OPEC's 18 dlr a barrel target, they said.    Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month,mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and memberswould submit to pressure to discount prices, oil traders said.    However, Opec's discipline in holding its price and outputtargets eventually forced many of the buyers back, they said.    Countries such as Qatar, Iran and Iraq refused to bend todemands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-liftingfrom Japanese buyers.    The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vesselsto store its production rather than cut its prices, they said.    Opec's March production was 14.6 mln bpd, 1.2 mln below itsceiling, with Saudi Arabia's output just below 3.0 mln bpdcompared to its Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd, the Middle EastEconomic Survey estimated.    "Of course there was a little cheating but not enough todestroy the market," an oil trader in Tokyo said.    Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market atdiscounted prices through barter deals and the swapping ofMiddle East grades for North Sea cargoes, but these trades havenot generated sufficient volume to depress the market, he said.    The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20to 25 cts below official prices, so resistance to buying crudeunder term contracts in the second quarter is likely to beweaker, traders said.    Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said todayOPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present outputvolume at 15.8 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly, orraising the production ceiling so members can produce more inthe third and fourth quarters of 1987.

TEXACO <TX> SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED Texaco Inc has re-established some keyoil supply lines following yesterday's court filing forprotection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, saidElton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.    "Several companies say they are willing to start trading,"Yates told Reuters in an interview.    The company last week had stated that a number of domesticand international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oilshipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.    Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and other banks toldTexaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texacosaid in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> and J.P.Morgan Co's <JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for depositsto cover transactions, it said.    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arosefrom an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. SupremeCourt in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> overthe acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco'splea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.    "Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as theycould," Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Courtruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and haltingsupplies.    "It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into anavalanche," he said. "Supplies were cut to the point where wecould not run the system at anywhere near capacity."    He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been injeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortagesby mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Eltonsaid.    It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,Occidental Petroleum Co <OXY> demanded cash for crude, andAtlantic Richfield Co <ARC> asked for special safeguards.    The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC <BP> lastweek refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates todaysaid, "a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go onsupplying. They had cancelled last week."    He declined to identify the company.    <Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oilcompany that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, alsohalted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.    But he added that Texaco expected to meet with theVenezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that keysupply line. Talks were also expected to take place with theAlgerians, he added.    Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit linesand oil supplies that are key to the company's business.    "It will be business as usual for Texaco," said MartinKlein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyerand Traub.    "Creditors are a nervous bunch of people," he said. "Butwhen the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation andwill likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company."    But other officials at Texaco were not immediatelyavailable to say whether discussions were being held with itsbanks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished. Reuter
KUWAITI DAILY SAYS OPEC CREDIBILITY AT STAKE OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutinyin coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies ofoil to international oil markets, the Kuwait daily al-Qabassaid.    In an article headlined "Gulf oil sources say Middle Eastproduction up 1.4 mln bpd" and "Markets witness new surplus amidwhispers of return to cheating days," it warned OPEC's officialprices could face fresh pressure from international oilcompanies seeking cheaper supplies.    It did not say whether only OPEC or Opec and otherproducers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nordid it specify if the sources were official or other contacts.   "The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come underfresh scrutiny from Monday, with activity in the European andAmerican markets," it said.    The sources were quoted as saying that after Opec had inMarch demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, somemembers had raised output last week. It gave no details.    "Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec wasable to control production, or whether the days of cheating andproducing over quotas has begun anew," it reported.   "The sources warned that maybe the (price of a) barrel of oilwill fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next ifthere is no control on supplies.    "The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrelmay open the doors for international oil companies to pressureOpec over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,"it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to liftfrom Qatar unless it gave price discounts.

ABU DHABI MARKETING SAID NOT BREACHING OPEC PACT A senior Abu Dhabi oil official saidin remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in theUnited Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing itscrude oil without breaching OPEC accords.    Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu DhabiNational Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Communitymagazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations."The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for itscustomers in accordance with market conditions...And takenecessary steps to guarantee marketing its production," he said.   "The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based onadherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to controlproduction and establish a new pricing system in an attempt tostabilize the market," he added.    OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mlnbpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.    Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the futuredepended on how much discipline OPEC showed.    Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, wasADNOC's most difficult ever but "a practical and flexiblepricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed marketenvironment."    He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product salestotalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.

TEXACO FILING ADDS UNCERTAINTY IN OIL MARKET U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc'sfiling for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code isadding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, butopinions are divided on the impact to the market.    "The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today," saidone trader. "Everyone is talking about it, assessing theircompany's situations in relation to Texaco," he added.     Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco areconcerned about whether they will receive payment or suppliesunder the bankruptcy filing.    However, others were less worried. "The first paid will bethe trading community and those connected with Texaco in theshipping industry," one New York trader said.    "If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run itsrefineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,"he added.    Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlementwith Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegallyinterferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.

Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment orletters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texacoon an open line basis, he said.    Another trader, however, described today's activity asbusiness as usual, adding that traders feel more secure becauseno liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is inbankruptcy.    Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texacofiling on crude futures trading although they said the exchangemight lower Texaco's position limit and require higher marginsfor Texaco's trades.    New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFaddendeclined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that isis proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that asa matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lowerallowable position limits or increase margin requirements forcompanies that are in financial trouble.

ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION Ecuador will resume limited crude outputnext week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oilto a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state EcuadoreanPetroleum Corp (CEPE) said.    CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuadorwould begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude innortheastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week inpreparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up toneighbouring Colombia.    Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when anearthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio,at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacificport of Balao.    It will take at least until the end of July to repair thepipeline and return output to normal levels. The country waspumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.    To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador isconstructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting pointof Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.    The original target date to resume limited crude output wasMay eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the LagoAgrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesmansaid. Reuter

ASIA TRYING TO FOSTER OIL EXPLORATION, SAYS U.N. Asian countries are offering better oilexploration concessions to avert damaging shortfalls due tolast year's oil price slump, the United Nations said.    The Bangkok-based U.N. Economic and Social Commission forAsia and the Pacific said in its annual report that the pricefall substantially cut exploration by foreign oil firms, whichfound it unprofitable to maintain investments in the region.    Oil production investment in Indonesia fell to about 2.8billion dlrs in 1985 from 3.2 billion in 1983 and was estimatedto have declined six pct last year. There were 11 wells drilledin Thailand in 1986 against 64 in 1985.    The report said <Thai Shell Exploration and Production CoLtd>, a unit of the <Royal Dutch/Shell Group> announced a 30pct cut in exploration and production spending last year.    To counter declining output, India and Malaysia reducedpetroleum sharing demands, while Indonesia cut taxes.    Nepal offered a guaranteed income share of up to 87.5 pctto cover exploration costs, while Thailand began decreasing its12.5 pct royalty payments. The big losers were major regionalexporters such as Indonesia, Brunei, China, Malaysia and Iran.Their aggregate oil income fell an estimated 20 billion dlrs in1986 from 40 billion the previous year.    Indonesia's export earnings fell by nearly half in 1986from 11.6 billion dlrs in 1985, the U.N. Report said.    Iran also lost about six billion dlrs, Brunei 3.8 billion,China three billion and Malaysia 0.8 billion.    However, Asian importers saved between eight and ninebillion dlrs during 1985 and 1986, which considerably easedtheir balance of payments.    South Korea, the Philippines, India, Thailand and Pakistanwere major beneficiaries, with Thailand and Pakistanrespectively saving about 875 mln and 435 mln dlrs last year. REUTER
ESSO UK PLANNING SLIGHTLY LESS OIL EXPLORATION <Esso U.K. Plc>'s 1987 explorationscheme involves less activity than last year, said a companyspokeswoman.    She confirmed that Esso UK, a member of Exxon Corp <XON>,was likely to participate in 15 to 20 wells this year, against25 wells last year. Total capital expenditure budget this year,however, will be similar to last year's budget of about 450 mlnstg, she said.    She added that exploration and production expenditure lastyear was 370 mln stg and Esso UK turned the year with 1.2billion stg of forward capital commitment.    The spokeswoman said 30 to 40 pct in cost savings had beenmade for development plans for Kittiwake - the only field inthe Shell-Esso Gannet North Sea oil and gas cluster still beingconsidered for development over the next few years.    Esso UK and <Shell U.K. Exploration and Production>, partof the Shell Transport and Trading <SC.L> group, have so farspent between 300 to 350 mln stg on Kittiwake, with recoverablereserves of some 70 mln barrels. Cost savings were also made onthe 40 to 45 mln barrel Osprey field which is expected to costat least 150 mln stg to develop.

HODEL SAYS ODDS ON FINDING NEW ALASKA OIL 1-IN-5 U.S. Interior Secretary Donald Hodelsaid there was a one in five chance that new drilling in Alaskawould find oil.    "But if it's there, there's a very good chance that it wouldbe a giant field," Hodel said on ABC's "Good Morning America."    "So it is the best geological prospect that they(geologists) have talked to me about since I've been involvedin this process," he said.    Hodel announced yesterday that he would urge Congress toopen up 1.5 mln acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge inAlaska to oil exploration despite fears of environmental damagethreatening the Caribou herd in the region.    He said today the exploration was needed in an effort toprevent future U.S. oil shortages and said oil drilling in thelarge Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska proved oil could be drilledwithout severely damaging the environment.    He said the Caribou herd at Prudhoe Bay had tripled,contrary to concerns before the drilling operation that itwould endanger the herd. Reuter

ECUADOR TO USE COLOMBIA OIL LINK FOR FIVE YEARS Ecuador will use a new pipeline linkwith Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.    The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built toallow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,    Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed itsOPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debtscontracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuadormines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.    The two ministers were speaking at a news conference aftersigning an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitationof the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drillingwill begin in September.    "The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not onlyfor this emergency period but for the next five years, withpossibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrelsper day (bpd) will be pumped along it," Perry said.    Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrelsthrough the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 centsper barrel during the first year.    The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, willrun from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungleoilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to thePacific port of Tumaco.    Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on theEcuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures forColombia's 11 km segment but said it was "insignificant comparedwith what we are going to earn."    OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd beforethe quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mlndlrs per month, Espinosa said. REUTER
QATAR"S BANKS SET FOR FURTHER LEAN SPELL Bank profits in the Gulf oil state ofQatar are coming under renewed pressure and foreign banks areretrenching further in one of the region"s most overbankedmarkets.    Results for 1986 show a year of declining profit forseveral foreign banks, although locally-owned operations werein some cases able to cushion the drop by increasing marketshare.    <Qatar National Bank SAQ>"s (QNB) General Manager, AbdullaKhalid al-Attiya, said: "The economy is not improving as wehoped... 1987 will be another difficult year for the banks."    Oil-dependent Qatar, with a tiny indigenous population of60,000 to 80,000 and an expatriate workforce estimated at about280,000, boasts five local banks and 10 foreign bankoperations.    Local and foreign bankers in the capital said the Gulf-widerecession, aggravated this year by Qatar"s severe difficultymarketing its crude oil at official OPEC prices, has taken aheavy toll on the economy and bank profitability.    As a result, the only U.S. Bank, <Citibank NA>, is thoughtto be negotiating to sell its operation to the fast growinglocally based <Al Ahli Bank of Qatar QSC> which only startedoperations in 1984, bankers said. Citibank would not comment.    Other foreign banks have retrenched, with <StandardChartered Bank> cutting staff and others expected to follow.<Banque Paribas> is examining a change in its status to admit51 pct Qatari ownership in a bid to improve its access to localbusiness, bankers said.    One banker added: "Weak profits are here to stay for thetime being. There is no cause for optimism at the moment."    Sentiment had picked up briefly at the end of last yearwhen OPEC reached its accord to curb oil output and return tofixed prices. However, it soon became apparent that Qatar washaving difficulty selling oil at OPEC prices.    The soft spot oil market has left official Qatari crudeprices 20 to 40 cents more expensive and sales have beenrunning in recent weeks at 100,000 and 120,000 barrels per day,well down on the nation"s OPEC quota of 285,000, oil sourcessaid.    Bankers said this serious shortfall in Qatar"s revenue hasled to a new spate of payments delays from the public sector toprivate contractors after a marginal improvement in January.    Loan loss provisions continued to eat into bank profitslast year, as did the introduction of minimum reserverequirements by the Qatar Monetary Agency. Trade financing hasalmost dried up as a traditional source of bank income.    Of the local banks, QNB conducts the bulk of thegovernment"s business and subsequently enjoys a huge advantageits rivals cannot expect to match, bankers said.    The bank reported a 2.9 pct rise in net 1986 profit to 93.1mln Qatari riyals, while its balance sheet grew by 10.8 pct to9.0 billion, making it by far the largest bank in Qatar.    But the strong assets growth partly reflected bridgingloans for the public and private sector to tide governmentdepartments and local business over the lean economic spell,Attiya said. "Generally speaking, we are overbanked in Qatar," hesaid, echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community.    Other local banks fared less strongly. The second largest,<Doha Bank Ltd QSC>, reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to27.5 mln riyals, while <Commercial Bank of Qatar Ltd QSC>,registered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985.    The newcomer Al Ahli Bank, continued to expand rapidly andreported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during thestart-up period from August 4, 1984 to end-1985.    Bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to wincommercial deposits previously held by foreign banks,increasing already strong pressure on non-Qatari banks toreexamine their staffing levels and overheads.    <Grindlays Bank PLC> recorded a net loss at its Doha branchlast year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profitin 1985 of 12,000 riyals.    Two other long-established banks in the Gulf, the <BritishBank of the Middle East> (BBME) and Standard Chartered, alsofound last year a difficult climate to make strong profits.    BBME"s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in1985, but Assistant Manager John Farquharson said 1985"s resulthad been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions.    "Foreign banks are seeing their assets decline, while localbanks are increasing their market share," Farquharson said.    BBME"s operating profit was steady in 1986, edging up to12.3 mln riyals from 11.5 mln in 1985. "We are expecting thesame level of operating profit in 1987," Farquharson said.    Standard Chartered"s net profit last year recovered slightlyto 1.6 mln riyals after a loss of 161,000 in 1985. Staffnumbers were cut last year to reduce overheads.    Bankers said the lack of new construction projects in Qatarmeans business is unlikely to pick up this year although hopesare rising that the start of Qatari gas exploitation couldprovide a boost. But the threat of higher U.S. Interest ratesmay erode bank deposits as savings are moved offshore. REUTER
U.S. CONSIDERING OIL INDUSTRY TAX INCENTIVES The Reagan Administration isconsidering tax incentives to boost oil output and restore100,000 jobs, U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said.

The tax status of exploration might also be changed,Herrington told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress.    He said the oil industry was experiencing difficult timesinternationally and had been devastated in the United States.    Consumer demand and a significant decline in domesticproduction has resulted in a rise in oil imports of one mlnbarrels a day in over the last 16 months, Herrington said.    "Steps must be taken...To reverse the downturn in ourdomestic energy industry and to safeguard and increase ourenergy security," he said.    The administration is committed to improving marketplaceconditions and incentives to spur exploration and development.

WORLD OIL DEMAND LIKELY TO INCREASE, SUBROTO SAYS Oil prices have stabilized in worldmarkets and demand is likely to increase in the second half ofthe year, Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Subroto said.    He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oilprices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixedprice OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demandhave been in equilibrium since March.    If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second halfof the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPECproducers have not been able to produce more oil at currentprices, he said.    But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting,whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mlnbarrels at its next meeting in June.    He said in his speech that world oil production over thelast two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or twomln barrels a day less than world oil demand.    Oil production by industrialized countries, particularlythe U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, butsome of that slack will be taken up by increased production inCameroon, India and other developing countries, he said.    This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oilproducers and consumers in the industrialized world for theupper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlierspeech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company.    "If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resumeits former role in world oil markets," he said.

SAUDIS NOT SEEKING OIL PRICE ABOVE 18 DLRS - MEES Saudi Arabia will not seek to push OPECoil prices above the current benchmark of 18 dlrs per barrelunless oil demand grows strongly, the Middle East EconomicSurvey (MEES) said.    The Cyprus-based weekly newsletter quoted authoritativeSaudi sources as saying the Kingdom's oil price policy wouldnot change "unless and until there is a strong revival in thegrowth of demand for oil."    MEES said this contradicted recent hints of new Saudi pricehawkishness from U.S. Congressional and oil industry sources.    The Saudi sources said their policy was firmly based on thelong-term need to restore the competitive position of oil ingeneral and OPEC oil in particular against other energysources.    "Saudi Arabia is certainly committed to cooperating with itsOPEC partners to exercise the necessary production restraint tomaintain the 18 dlr per barrel reference price level," MEESsaid.    The newsletter said Saudi output in the first three weeksof April averaged slightly above its OPEC quota of 4.133 mlnbarrels per day (bpd). Output would fall in the last week,causing the month's average to be below quota, MEES said.    MEES estimated overall OPEC production for April at around16.8-16.9 mln bpd -- two mln bpd more than both its figures forMarch and Reuter estimates for March.    It said Iranian production had risen by 500,000 bpd thismonth to 2.2-2.3 mln bpd, around its quota level. In Iraq, withan OPEC-assigned quota of 1.466 mln bpd, output rose this monthto two mln bpd, not including "war relief" supplies from Kuwaitand Saudi Arabia, the newsletter said.    Nigeria, which has had problems selling its full 1.238 mlnbpd entitlement, increased its output to 1.2 mln bpd, it added. REUTER

EXXON <XON> SEES DROP IN NEW OIL DISCOVERIES Exxon Corp chairman Lawrence Rawl saidtotal world energy consumption will continue to grow, but addednew oil discoveries worldwide are slowing down and can notoffset annual production.    In a speech at the World Petroleum Congress here, Rawl saidoil companies would increasingly be forced to turn to enhancedrecovery techniques, very heavy oil and synthetics tocompensate for substantial declines in conventional oilproduction.    "What our current outlook suggests is that total worldenergy consumption will continue to grow steadily in an evermore energy efficient world," Rawl said. But, he added, Exxonprojects that "despite today's ample supplies, the world willalso be facing up to inherent limitations on the availabilityof oil and gas, which currently supplies more than half of theworld's energy needs."    The Exxon chairman told some 1,500 oil executives fromaround the world that some synthetics projects could becomepractical when oil reaches 30 dlrs to 40 dlrs a barrel range inreal terms.    "The question is when and how this will happen," he said."I believe that synthetic projects will not only re-emerge butwill become commercial well below those we were thinking aboutthe last time oil prices moved substantially higher."    Rawl said synthetic fuel would become economic at lowerprices because companies are investigating "a new generation ofideas that promise substantially lower costs" and projectsbegun in the late 1970s, which have since been suspended.    Rawl also said companies must find new and more effectiveways of enhanced recovery from existing oil fields.    "It would be my view that new oil discoveries, even withadvanced technology, are likely to slow down - not reverse -the decline in worldwide oil discoveries," he said. "So it isessential to find a better way to recover more of thediscovered oil from producing fields using chemicals, solvents,heat, and other techniques."    Rawl emphasized that private oil companies need someassistance from government in developing synfuels technology."More importantly, they need to provide a political andeconomic environment that is stable enough to allow thedevelopmental process to function effectively, he said.    Rawl also said stable energy markets serve the bestinterest of producing and consuming nations by allowing bothgroups to plan for steady economic growth.    He did not make any oil price prediction, saying only thatthe economic goals of the U.S. and other nations can only beachieved if world oil prices "stabilize within a reasonablerange."    "Prices must be high enough to meet realistic aspirationsfor income and encourage resource development in the producingcountries, but not so high as to inhibit economic growth inconsuming nations," he said.    The Exxon chairman also criticized "the occasional attemptof consuming nations to try to control domestic oil prices,calling such protectionist measures disruptive to the world oilmarket. Reuter
DECLINE IN U.S. DOLLAR MAY BOOST OPEC OIL PRICE The sliding value of the U.S. dollarmay soon force the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries to raise its oil benchmark price, setting the stagefor prices as high as 22 dlrs a barrel by yearend, topexecutives with U.S. oil companies said.    The current benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel wasestablished by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries (OPEC) at its December meeting when the cartel set a15.8 mln barrel per day production ceiling.    But the continuing weakness of the U.S. dollar, thecurrency used by OPEC for its oil sales, is making the 18 dlrprice difficult to sustain, said Fred Hartley, chairman ofUnocal Corp <UCL>.    The U.S. dollar has fallen in value by about 10 pct sinceDecember and has fallen by a total of about 40 pct during thepast two years.    Hartley told Reuters he expected significantly higher oilprices this winter and would not rule out the potential for 25dlrs a barrel by the spring of 1988.    "I think June will be the critical month to see what theydo," said Hartley, who was in Houston to attend the WorldPetroleum Congress. OPEC has scheduled a regular meeting inJune which some experts believe is likely to revive suggestionsthat oil should be priced according to a basket of worldcurrencies instead of the U.S. dollar.    E.H. Clark, chairman of <Baker Hughes Inc>, said the Saudikingdom's need to generate revenues -- rather than greaterworld demand -- would drive any price increases.    "The Saudis have made committments and have a balance oftrade based on receiving 18 dlrs a barrel for this oil. But theU.S. dollar won't buy as much as it did five or six monthsago," Clark said in an interview. "I'm betting on the Saudiking's need to sustain revenues."    Clark predicted that world oil prices would top 22 dlrs abarrel by January one.    However, the authoritative Middle East Economic Surveyreported yesterday that Saudi Arabia would not seek to increaseOPEC oil prices unless oil demand showed strong growth.    Saudi sources told the newsletter that the policy was basedon the longterm need to restore the competitive position ofOPEC oil against other energy sources.    Many oil industry experts are forecasting a modest increasein world oil demand averaging one pct annually during the nextfew years.    Michel Moreau, a director of the <Elf Aquitaine Group>,said he believed the worldwide oil industry had reached aconsensus that prices of at least 20 dlrs a barrel werenecessary to cover exploration costs, royalties and taxes onnew production.    The 20 dlr level will be reached this year only if thecash-strapped nations of Nigeria, Egypt and Gabon refrain fromdiscounting oil prices or increasing production levels, Moreausaid.    "I think if more than two (OPEC nations) defect, theproduction agreement will fall apart," he said. "But thisthreat is the Saudis' big stick to keep producers in line.Nobody wants a repeat of the collapse that occurred in 1986."    Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp <XON>, told Reutershe expected prices would remain at 18 dlrs through the end of1987, adding that 20 dlrs a barrel was a possibility.    Other major companies are taking a more cautious view ofprices, fearing that some OPEC members may yet upset thecartel's production agreement.    "This is a year of testing," said Alfred Munk, manager offoreign affairs at Amoco Corp. (AN). "If they fail, there maybe a price decline to about 14 dlrs a barrel."    French-owned Total CFP's vice president Pierre Vaillaudsaid, "Demand is not going up very quickly, at best maybe onepercent a year. You can't change the price with just one pct,"Vaillaud said.

GOVERNMENTS SEEN MORE INVOLVED IN OIL DRILLING The offshore oil drilling industrywill attract increasing numbers of government connected firmsin the 1990s, according to Ronald Tappmeyer, Vice Chairman ofReading and Bates Drilling Co.     Tappmeyer told the Offshore Technology Conference thatcontract drilling was reaching the same kind of situation thatoil producing companies reached when their oilfields werenationalized in nations as Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia.     He said local connections to the nation whose waters arebeing drilled was an increasingly important factor in themarket.     "We have seen contractors put at competitive disadvantagesin nations in which they had worked successfully for yearsessentially moved aside to make room for locally-owned firms ora locally-built rig," he said.     Tappmeyer, who is president of the InternationalAssociation of Drilling Contractors, said how far the trendwould spread depends on the growth of trade protectionism.     He added that international contractors will increasinglyfind their role restricted to regions that require specialexpertise and experience, such as wildcat areas and severeenvironments such as in the Arctic and extremely deep waters.     Tappmeyer also said he expects producing companies toprovide the main financing for offshore drilling in the comingdecade as banks will be unwilling to repeat overexposingthemselves and drilling contractors will have difficultyproviding financing out of cash flow.     At the same time, he said he saw the financing as indirectas he does not see producers getting back in the rig-owningbusiness.     He also said projectfinancing will have to be backed upby work commitments to guarantee the payoff of constructioncosts.     For the time being, he said there was a superabundance ofrigs. But he said there will be a need for new, technologicallyadvanced rigs within a few years.     He said the floating-drilling rigs were most likely tobenefit from new developments in technology, adding that by2,000 there should not be an ocean left that is too deep, toocold, too stormy or too remote to be explored.

ENERGY/HEAVY OILS The oil price collapse of 1986 putdevelopment of a vast petroleum resource -- heavy and extraheavy oils -- on hold. But as oil prices increase the long-termeconomic outlook is favorable, oil industry experts said.    "Estimated potential world reserves of extra heavy oilsexceed 500 billion barrels, of which more than half are locatedin Venezuela," Juan Chacin Guzman, President of Petroleos deVenezuela told the World Petroleum Congress.    "And this virtually unused resource represents a primeexample of the need to invest in technology to ensuretomorrow's energy future," he added.    Venezuela had to reduce heavy crude oil output in favor oflight oils because of economics and a very limited market. Notmany refineries have been upgraded to process the heavy oils.    "Improved technology has the potential for reducing thecapital investment and operating costs of typical heavy oildevelopment projects by 30 pct or more," Gordon Willmon, VP andgeneral manager, oil sands and coal department, Esso ResourcesCanada Ltd said at the World Petroleum Congress.    Crude oil prices fell under 10 dlrs dlrs a barrel lastsummer as OPEC members increased production to gain marketshare, but have since risen to around 18 dlrs because the  OPECproduction/pricing agreement is basically in tact.    Willmon said light and medium crude oils currently supply90 pct of world oil demand yet they account for less than 25pct of remaining petroleum resources.    "So future demand increasingly will be met from the variousforms of heavy oil," Willmon said. Heavy crude oil resourcesinclude extra-heavy oil/tar sand, natural bituminous sands andoil shales (in sedimentary rock).     Willmon cited major factors that will make heavy oildevelopment economical, including real and stable growth incrude oil prices, favorable fiscal terms, and improvedtechnology.    He said he expects "all pieces of the puzzle to fittogether." But he cautioned that the short-term outlook is verysensitive to crude oil prices. And he said the most importantfactor in development of heavy oils is the recovery of theprice of crude.    Willmon said the price of light crude must be about eightdlrs higher than heavy crude before there is an incentive foran oil company to upgrade its refinery to process heavy oil.    He said the current price differential is only about fivedlrs a barrel.    Willmon indicated that a benchmark crude oil price above 20dlrs would be ideal. But he said currently under study are abroad range of high potential cost-effective technologies forresources recovery, transportation and upgrading of heavy oils,which would permit commercial development despite a lower crudeoil price outlook.    Willmon said these technologies included enhanced recoveryby steam injection and oil-and-water emulsion to reduce theviscocity of the heavy oils so they can flow easily through apipeline. He said such technologies may substantially reducecurrent captial investment and operating costs.    But he emphasized that innovative technology alone may notencourage new investment, that oil prices need to show ameaningful and sustained recovery.   Most of the expenses associated with heavy oils productionis fixed operating costs as in an oil sands project, ratherthan in exploration, according to Robert Smith, Senior VPOperations <Syncrude Canada Ltd>.    While exploration costs for conventional crude oil rangefrom four to nine dlrs a barrel, discovery costs for syntheticcrude from oil sands are nearly zero because the location andnature of the deposit are known, according to Smith.    But the remote location of oil sands deposits mean thateverything required to build and operate the plant must comefrom outside the area.    Willmon also said, "Public policy could best help byproviding financial support to offset the high cost oftechnology developmemt which would help generate projects thatcould survive even at low oil prices for extended periods oftime."    U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said, "The ReaganAdministration is firmly committed, without equivocation, tocontinuing our efforts to improve conditions and incentives inthe marketplace that will spur oil and gas exploration anddevelopment."

OIL IMPORT FEE BILL INTRODUCED IN U.S. HOUSE A bill that would impose an oilimport fee to support a world floor price for oil of 25 dlrs abarrel was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by12 Congressmen from oil-producing states.    The variable import fee would be dropped if oil prices riseabove 25 dlrs a barrel, sponsors of the bill said.    Revenues from the fee would be used to buy domestic oilfrom stripper wells - those that produce 10 barrels a day orless - at a fixed price of 25 dlrs a barrel. Purchases wouldstop when prices rose above that level.    "Time is running out on the domestic oil and gas industry,"Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said in a statement. "An oil importfee is really just the premium for a national insurancepolicy."    President Reagan opposes an oil import fee, but supportersof the bill said they hoped for action on it before the end ofthe year. Reuter
NIPPON MINING PLANS MORE U.S. JOINT VENTURES Nippon Mining Co Ltd president YukioKasahara said the state-owned Japanese firm hoped to findadditional joint venture partners to explore for U.S. oilreserves.    "We have to secure the stability of oil for Japan,"Kasahara told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. "Inthe exploration area I think Japanese companies are interestedin joint ventures."    Nippon Mining, for example, last September signed anagreement with Dupont Co's <DD> Conoco Inc to participate in a135 mln dlr exploration venture that includes six wells on landand 14 offshore Louisiana. The first joint well drilled is inthe Gulf of Mexico's Green Canyon Block 182, a deepwater leasethat Conoco was almost forced to return to the federalgovernment undrilled because of low oil prices.    "At this moment we have no success but we will proceed withConoco. Maybe by the end of the year we will find oil there,"Kasahara said. He said that similar kinds of joint ventures"would be best" for Nippon Mining's oil exploration efforts inthe future.    Kasahara also said Nippon Mining was not planning toacquire any U.S. refining or marketing outlets. "Retail salesin general do not interest the Japanese oil companies," hesaid.    When asked whether he believed world oil prices mightstrengthen later this year, Kasahara said he expected prices tohold steady at today's level.    "Within this year I think the 18 dlrs a barrel willcontinue. But next year I don't know," he said. "For therefining business, stability is important. Whether the price is18 dlrs or 20 dlrs, we don't care."    But encouraging additional upstream efforts may requiremodestly higher oil prices, Kasahara added. "For exploration Ithink 20 dlrs a barrel or 22 dlrs a barrel would bereasonable," he said.    The key factor in determining whether the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would raise its 18 dlr abarrel benchmark price is the ongoing war between Iran andIraq, Kasahara said. Saudi Arabia, he added, was an uncertainelement in the OPEC equation because of its need to maintainrevenues at the same time the weakened U.S. dollar has reducedoil profits.    Nippon Mining, which like all Japanese crude buyers isbenefitting from the drop in the value of the dollar, favorscontinuing to price OPEC crude oil according to U.S. currencyregardless of the dollar-yen relationship, Kasahara said.    "I hope the dollar would strengthen eventually and continueto improve. I would prefer to see the (OPEC) pricing remain indollars," he said. Reuter
CHINESE OFFICIALS SAY DRILLING OUTLOOK BRIGHT China's oil drilling industry is one ofthe few bright spots in the international oilpatch with about1,000 rigs currently working and annual increases of 80-100expected through the end of the century, a Chinese petroleumofficial said.    "In China, production concentrates on the domestic market,and does not depend on the international price of oil," ZhaiGuang Ming, a director of the Chinese Ministry of Petroleum,told Reuters.    Chinese oil sold within the nation's borders is priced atabout one-third the 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price establishedby the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Zhai saidin an interview at the World Petroleum Congress.    The optimism in China is in sharp contrast to the UnitedStates where weak oil prices have prompted a steep fall in thenumber of active rigs from a 1981 peak of 4,500 to only 765last week according to the latest Baker Hughes Co rig count.    At this time, China actually has more rigs in operationthan any other country in the world, said Xianglin Hou, anothermember of the 20-man Chinese delegation at the Houston meeting.    But this does not mean good news for the sagging oilfieldequipment industry in the rest of the world, said Bryan Walman,international sales manager for Reed Tool Co in Houston.    Walman said more than 90 pct of China's drilling activityis on land and under the control of the Chinese governmentwhich requires local manufacture of drilling equipment.    But U.S. and other western nations do provide equipment forChina's fledgling offshore projects as well as participate inthe actual drilling, he said.    Amoco Corp <AN>, for example, has reported a discovery in1,000 feet of water in the South China Sea.    "We're encouraged," said Alfred Munk, manager of Amoco'sforeign affairs, "but we need substantial reserves before wecan do commercial production in a remote area like that."     Zhai estimated that current Chinese oil production of 130mln tonnes a year should rise to total 200 mln tonnes annuallyby the year 2,000.    Chinese crude reserves total 23.6 billion barrels, withultimate resources estimated at 69.3 billion barrels. Reuter
FTC FINDS 17 BILLION DLR COST IN OIL IMPORT FEE An oil import fee could costconsumers nearly 17 billion dlrs a year and undermine long-termU.S. energy security by leading to a quicker depletion of domestic reserves, a Federal Trade Commission study said.    The study by the FTC's bureau of economics found that afive dlr a barrel tariff on crude oil and gasoline oil importswould increase costs to consumers by 14 to 16.7 billion dlrs ayear.    After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against thecosts, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee wouldhave a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year.    Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10dlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cutthe federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energyconservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil.    But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs wouldreduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domesticoil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found.    "Any attempt to increase our energy security by limitingimports will actually reduce our long-run energy security byspeeding the depletion of domestic reserves," the study said.    The five dlr a barrel tariff would also cut domesticpetroleum refiners' profits by 7.5 to 10 billion dlrs a year,increase domestic crude oil producers' profits by about 13billion dlrs a year and raise government revenues by 6.7 to 8.2 billion dlrs a year, the FTC said.    Under the Reagan administration, the FTC has consistentlyopposed government regulation of the oil industry at the stateand federal levels.    "This study backs up my belief that government regulationand interference with competition hurt both the market andconsumers," FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said in a statement. Reuter
OFFSHORE OIL INDUSTRY WAITING FOR TURNAROUND The depressed offshore oil industry isstill waiting for a turnaround despite increasing optimisimthat world oil prices have stabilized around 18 dlrs a barrel.     "The perception of a turnaround comes from the change inprices," Charles Siess Jr, vice chairman of MarathonManufacturing Co, a subsidiary of USX Corp <X>, and chairman ofthe National Ocean Industries Association, said in a pressbriefing at the Offshore Technology Conference.     "From the level of industry activity, there is noturnaround," he added.     John Huff, president of Oceaneering International Inc<OCER>, was slightly more optimistic. "We are through the lowpart of the cycle -- there's an increase in interest forprojects," he said, adding, "whether it comes to orders, whoknows?"     The oil industry is recovering from last year's dramaticfall in oil prices, from 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to under10 dlrs in mid-1986. Particularly hard hit were the servicecompanies that provide the oil rigs with keys products, such aspipe and tools.     Earlier in the week, Secretary the Interior Donald Hodelannounced -- at the Conference -- the government's newfive-year offshore oil and gas leasing program, proposing 38sales, including tracts in the Gulf Coast, offshore Californiaand in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.     For the most part, the industry was disappointed with theplan, with most arguing that additional areas should have beenincluded. At the same time, most were supportive of Hodel.     Environmental concerns, particularly in California, hadlobbied strenuously against offshore oil development.     "The (Outer Continental Shelf) leasing program fails totake into account the environmental performance of the oilindustry," said Bill Bradford, executive vice president ofDresser Industries <DI> and president of the PetroleumEquipment Suppliers Association.     Huff quoted National Academy of Science figures showingoffshore rigs contributed only two pct of petroleum pollutionin the oceans, while tankers were responsible for 47 pct andmuniciple dumping 31 pct.     "The OCS is the keystone of the domestic reservedevelopment program," said Siess, adding that with oil importsrising to 50 pct of U.S. oil consumption, the issue was one ofnational security.     Looking ahead, Constantine S. Nicandros, president ofDupont's <DD> Conoco Inc subsidiary, said, "We are more likelyto see a five pct increase in spending this year than thewidely-forecast five pct decrease."     Other optimistic signs include the recent sale in NewOrleans of offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico which raised290 mln dlrs against an expected 90 mln.     However, Ronald Tappmeyer, vice chairman of Reading andBates Drilling Co <RB>, said the oversupply of rigs wouldcontinue for the near-term, but added demand fortechnologically advanced rigs would increase in the 1990s.     Much of that demand is seen coming from the move intoicreasingly deeper waters, with the projects becoming ever moreexpensive and needing five to ten years to develop.     Over 50 pct of the sales in New Orleans were for deepwater tracts.     Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co, asubsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell <RD>, and president of theMarine Technology Society, said the technology existed to drillexploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water.     Geer said the industry was particularly interested in theGreen Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number ofcompanies, including Shell, Conoco, USX Corp's Marathon Oil Co,Standard Oil Co <SRD> and Placid Oil Co, are working, many ofthem testing new deep-water technologies involving floatingplatforms.

PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE Crude oil prices could remain around 18dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision onoutput at its next meeting would be the critical factor, anofficial of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos(Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.    Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president ofinternational trade, said current OPEC output already appearedto be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itselffor the third quarter. "Production is surging ahead of what wasoriginally planned, while demand is growing more slowly thanenvisaged a few months ago," he said.    He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level ofproduction in the third quarter would effectively sustain the18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally beenenvisaged might soften price levels.    The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 inVienna to review its December accord on prices and output.    "I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude interms of volume decisions," Lajous said.    A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boostedoutput and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, isalways there as a possibility, he said.    "I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. Iexpect other oil exporters have learned their lessons anddiscipline will be maintained," he said.    Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long asthis remains there will be a tendency to instability in oilmarkets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during1987 if output remains under control.    He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, thatincreased production was not so important as long as incomeswould not be affected by the output, were "very relevant andwelcome from such a powerful producer."

SAUDI RENEGOTIATION OF ARAMCO DEAL MOVING ALONG Saudi Arabia's renegotiation of itscollective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for thelatter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to afundamental structural change in the contract, oil industrysources said.    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition,said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices andvolumes and other terms may be rearranged.    The agreement signed in January for the months fromFebruary to June is up for renegotiation.    Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mlnbpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp<XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc <TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp<MOB> and Chevron Corp <CHV> 550,000 bpd between them.    But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarterallowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift itsobligations under the contract    PIW said that that one alternative under consideration isto revert to four individual contracts rather than a collectiveagrement.    John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry ResearchFoundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more ofa formality as the Saudis have each company on a separateschedule although separate agreements with the companies wouldfavor one on one negotiations and ensure that contractedliftings occur .    "The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants withinlimits as they do not want to antagonize them for the longhaul," he said.    Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likelyconcentrate on volume rather than price.    Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been notedand in April industry publications said that renegotiation werebeing sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.    Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp <CHV>, ExxonCorp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB> and Texaco Inc <TX> but is nowowned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although theex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia.

COMPROMISE SEEN LIKELY OVER CONOCO-STATOIL DISPUTE Norway is expected to seek a compromisesolution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats OljeselskapA/S <STAT.OL> (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firmwill operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said.    The sources, who asked not to be named, said the governmentwill likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as thefield's operator through the development phase, with Statoiltaking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.    Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government hadtoday discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decisionhad been taken and several questions remained unresolved.    It was unlikely the government would announce its decisionon Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meetingand after discussing a proposed solution with both companies,the sources added.    This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoilexercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration licensethat, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieveConoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised byConoco.    Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry asthe most likely candidate for the first field developmentproject on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off centralNorway. Reuter

MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS Flooding in the Red River on theTexas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels perday of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, aTexaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.    "The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get anydivers down to assess the damage but there is some possibilitythat the pipeline could be up by the end of the week," a companysource said.    The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude andone-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.    Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service isrestored by Friday there would be little problem in restoringoil which has been lost to the flood.    "But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will bedifficult to make up without prorationing and we would not liketo proration this pipeline, if we don't have to."    The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic RichfieldCorp <ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/ShellGroup <RD> and Texaco Inc <TX>, which is the pipeline'soperator.     Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crudeoil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose tonew highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.    July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.    Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers ofWTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.    Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipelineshutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with WestTexas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr abarrel below WTI, respectively.    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs atTexaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five daysbut that will depend on when the water level of the Red Riverrecedes. There is already evidence that the water level isdropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the areaaffecting the pipeline, Stevens said.    He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged wasunderground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoilnearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil wasapparently washed away.       The potential for environmental damage is being downplayedat this time despite the volume of oil that runs through thisline.    Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has notfound any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,which is nearby. Reuter
CONGRESSMAN SAYS U.S. UNPREPARED FOR OIL CUTOFF Rep. Mike Synar said today that whilePresident Reagan is ready to use military force to protectKuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-preparedat home to deal with a new energy crisis.    Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in commentson a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S.participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharingprogram of the International Energy Agency.    The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, wasformed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to dealwith any future oil cutoff.    Synar said, "the president is prepared to take militaryaction to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling totake less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare ournation for the next energy crisis."    Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilersto assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil,increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar,who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action ina previous IEA test, said the United States successfullyadvocated a test limited to training participants in oilsharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects.

LUKMAN SEES STABLE OIL PRICE FOR NEXT COUPLE YEARS The current crude oil price of between18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next coupleof years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum tokeep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.    Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish tradeofficials, said the stable price depended upon output restraintby both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish governmentofficials said.    They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, madethe remarks whilst talking about the connection between ThirdWorld debt and industrialised nations.    Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higherenergy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.    Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around thebeginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrialcountries that depend on imported energy, they would only leadto wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, hesaid.    This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely highprices, he added.    Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a majorcrisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled. REUTER
ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said heexpects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.    "I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," Hodel told theSenate Energy Committee.    Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production throughthe shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wellsbecause of low prices was probably permanent. He said he wasalso concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.    Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He saidgeologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discoveryof oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.    "The area could contain potentially recoverable oilresources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearlyequal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently providesalmost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production," Hodel said.    He said production from the new section could begin aboutthe time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000without endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area. Reuter
MAJOR U.S. PIPELINE MAY BE CLOSED SEVERAL DAYS The operator of a major U.S. crude oilpipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may beseveral days before repairs are made and the system isfunctioning again.    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs atTexaco Inc <TX>, operator of the pipeline through itssubsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairswill begin in about five days and expects it to take severalmore days to complete.    "At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to getthe job done," Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairswill depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult toassess because of flooding on the Red River.    The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crudeoil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 dayspreceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.    The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to WitchitaFalls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the RedRiver crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because ofsevere rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.    Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipelinecould operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to makeup for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk withcustomers to determine their requirements.    Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices.

COLOMBIAN GROUP SUSPENDS BOMBINGS OF PIPELINES A Colombian group announced the suspensionof its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government's levyof a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mlndlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY>.    There was no indication the government would meet theconditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army(ELN).    According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carriedout 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986.    The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, havecaused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage.    In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of onedollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as acondition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults.    Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels perday in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigatingOccidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.    If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of upto 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge thepenalty. Reuter
BASIN PIPELINE REOPENS IN U.S. SOUTHWEST The Basin Pipeline in the SouthwesternU.S. reopened yesterday with the expectation that all crude oilshipments for June will arrive on schedule, according to aspokesman for Texaco Inc. <TX>, operator of the pipelinethrough its Texaco Pipeline Co subsidiary.    "We project the pipeline will make all June crude shipmentsscheduled," said Dan Stevens, the spokesman.     The pipeline reopened Sunday evening around 1900 EDT,carrying an equivalent 280,000 barrels of crude oil per daycompared with an average 225,000 bpd shipped during the 30 daysbefore its shutdown on May 30, according to Stevens.    Stevens said the increased shipments will make up for allcrude oil scheduled to arrive in Cushing, Oklahoma via thepipeline by the end of June.    The pipeline was shut May 30 because of an apparent rupturecaused by flooding of the Red River, near the Texas/Oklahomaborder. It was expected to resume service Saturday but risingwaters of the river, which had recently receded, delayed thereopening, Stevens said. Approximately 1100 feet of new 24-inchsteel piping was installed under the river to replace damagedpiping, according to Stevens. Reuter

OPEC OFFICIAL SAYS CARTEL HAS REGAINED LEADERSHIP OPEC has regained its former role asprice-setter in the oil market following last year's price war,acting OPEC Secretary General Fadhil al-Chalabi said.    But he said he expects no short-term rise in demand forOPEC oil, adding that market stability will mean a continuedsacrifice for the 13 OPEC member countries.    Al-Chalabi, speaking at a university here yesterday, saidthe December 1986 conference at which OPEC set an 18 dlr perbarrel reference price gave the market a signal that theproducers' group was serious.    "It (OPEC) has no choice but to defend the price and thishas restored its credibility," said al-Chalabi, who is inCaracas for a meeting of the OPEC Fund Board of Governors.    Al-Chalabi said OPEC members have not exceeded theproduction quotas which took effect on February 1 and spotmarket prices are now near or above official OPEC prices.    Before the December conference OPEC faced a major and basicdilemma which led to the loss of its leadership role, he said."The question was, what should OPEC do? Defend the price andrisk losing its market share? Or defend its market share andlet the price drop?" he asked.    "OPEC has chosen to stabilise the price. But the question ishow long will it be willing to keep up this painful exercise?" he said.    Al-Chalabi said that despite OPEC's success in shoring upprices and achieving discipline regarding quotas, he saw noquick end to restraint in production.    He also said he foresaw no increase in demand for OPEC oilbecause increased non-OPEC production, combined withconservation and the use of alternative energy sources, hascaused changes in the market which will not easily be reversed.

The decline in production in the nine months to end-Marchreflected mainly a sharp dip early in the fiscal year, when lowoil prices and high marginal excise rates led to a reduction ofoutput from Bass Strait, department figures in its Major EnergyStatistics publication show.

INDONESIA CUTS JULY CRUDE SUPPLIES TO JAPAN Indonesia's state oil company, Pertamina,has informed its affiliated Japanese companies that crude oilsupplies will be 40 pct less than contractual volumes in July,a spokesman for an affiliated company said.

Allocations of Indonesia's main traded crude, Minas, hadbeen cut by 50 pct and Duri by 38 pct, he said.    Last month contractual volumes were cut by 30 pct.    Contractual volumes assume no production ceiling.

OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS Some OPEC states are unhappy about theprices assigned to their crude oil but this should not posegreat problems when the group reviews its six-month-old priceand output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.    They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conferencepresidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievancesabout price differentials making some of their crudesuncompetitive.    There has also been speculation by Japanese traders thatOPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.    But most experts agree that a major overhaul of pricedifferentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the marketsignals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.    "All OPEC members can make a good case for changingdifferentials," said one analyst with a major oil company. "Butat the end of the day, the attitude is going to be "leave wellalone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered."    Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also sawsales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminishedcustomer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,marketing incentives have helped their sales.    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes bymeans of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongsidebetter priced grades in a "package."    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at leastfor some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC shouldchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand forfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. Atits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixedprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel referencepoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985when members offered discounts to attract customers.    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarterand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extendor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do notmirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlrtarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,analysts say.    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and onenon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key exportcrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oilexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts sayonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells atofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processingor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance topay the new prices.   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank belowits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output hasrisen.    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and sayits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's KleinwortGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push thedifferentials question in Vienna.    "It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, whichholds the presidency, raised the issue," he said. REUTER

PETRO-CANADA RAISES CRUDE POSTINGS 32 CTS CANAD A spokesman for the EuropeanCommunity Commission defended the controversial plan for a levyon oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to helpalleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.    Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission'sDirectorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oilsand Fats Contact Days "the Commission firmly believes that thesacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers inthe oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers tomake an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problemwithin that sector by paying a levy."    The proposed tax is necessary because the level ofbudgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseedsproduction has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.    Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion EuropeanCurrency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's "standstill"agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would thenfeel the full impact of its enlargement.    The Commission has proposed several cost and productioncutting measures which include the introduction of a maximumguaranteed quantity system, he added.    Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumerprices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghesaid.    Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatoryamount when market prices are below or above this level.    He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatoryamount would be used to finance the Common AgriculturalPolicy's oils and fats regime.    "The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to theproposed tax) have for the most part been based on incompleteor an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal," he said.    Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.    It would not be discriminatory because it would be appliedto domestic and imported products, and past experience showedit would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.    EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they dounder present aid arrangements, he said.    The competitiveness between different oils, whether ECproduced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantitiesimported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,Tanghe said.    The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overalleffect would stabilise Community production levels withoutaffecting demand, he said.    It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain currentimport levels, he said.    Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they areimported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and mealsrequirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from importedbeans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.

U.K. COURT RULES AGAINST RTZ ON OIL FIELD COSTS The U.K. High Court dismissed an appealby Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's <RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unitand ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for thefuture cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,the Press Association reported.    The company was appealing against a decision of the TaxCommissioners that any such provision was a capitalexpenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.The court was told that since 1976 the company had made anannual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost ofabandoning a rig.    An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as thesubsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductiblefrom corporation tax payable.    It would have been a bonus if the company had won but allbudgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, hesaid.    Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability wasshared by the industry as a whole.

The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministersin December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18dlrs a barrel.    Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December tojust above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analystsfirmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreementto keep the market stable.    "I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position tostrengthen the gains we have made so far," Lukman said.    He declined to say if the current ceiling should bemaintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.    "Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by ourcollective will to keep the market strong," he said.    He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeksago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and thiswas significant for its members.    Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this yearwhen OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and arestocking now for the winter was responsible for currentmarket strength. Reuter

UNOCAL<UCL> SCRAPS FLUIDIZED BED BOILER PROJECT Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bedcombustion technology, a method for the more efficient burningof solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Coloradodue to high costs.    Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. SyntheticFuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology atthe oil shale plant. In return the company would have beeneligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supportsfrom the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contractfrom the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.    Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidizedbed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.    The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat andelectricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.    Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investmenttax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the projectuneconomical even with government price supports and loanguarantees, Unocal said.    The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said. Reuter

FAR EAST TRADERS EXPECT 20 DLR OIL IN JANUARY OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boostspot prices and enable the group to raise its officialreference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.    "Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and theofficial price will be 20 dlrs in January," a Japanese refinersaid.    The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPECmembers such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait andQatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.    Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading asthe market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrsfor Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs forU.K. Brent, traders said.    They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked intothe U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.    "With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will importMideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen thosegrades further," said a Japanese oil trader.    Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spotmarket has further upward potential in the short term, havingrisen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.    "You could certainly argue that if New York rose on thatbasis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today," saidone international oil trader in Tokyo.    "But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be boughtback up again pretty quickly," he added.    One oil industry analyst concurred, "There is no reason toexpect a weak market from now on." He said he expected OPEC toraise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.    Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge stronglyin the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members andthe likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer tomaintain steady prices.    Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per daycompared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Itsexport capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipelinethrough Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.    Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting upto 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.    Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheatingon the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective pricediscounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. Butthey mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act asswing producer, cutting production to compensate for higheroutput by other members or boosting output if spot prices risetoo high too fast.    Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mlnbarrels. "Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so thestockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it risestoo much," an oil industry analyst said. REUTER
SAUDI OIL COMPANY GETS NEW ACTING GOVERNOR The acting governor of Saudi Arabia'sstate-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, hasretired at his own request, oil industry sources said.    They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisationplanning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.    Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,left in a major oil industry shake up last December.    The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold thepost permanently.    The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed ZakiYamani from their posts late last year in a move which industrysources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oilmarket.    The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, SaudiArabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tunedto the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.    Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led anOPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrellast December.    Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operationswhich could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabiadoes business, the sources said.    The sources had said possible candidates for the governor'sjob include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, whoearlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University ofPetroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning MinisterFaisal Beshir.

NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback inplanned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helletold Reuters.    "We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,"he said. "The accord reached there means stability in the oilmarket and we shall continue making our contribution."    The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, wouldprobably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Hellesaid. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies andwould now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.    OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 andretained the fixed prices that were set in its December accordbased on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, andit's December pact had provisionally set a third quarterceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourthquarter.    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshorefields, previously said it would continue its output curbs fromplanned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remainedwithin its December accord on output and prices.    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mlnbpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented sinceFebruary reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland fora meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statementon the latest oil production cutbacks.    Over the past year several other leading non-OPECproducers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysiaand Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keepprices stable.    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following anOPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total exportearnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil priceduring the first half of 1986.    But firmer oil prices since then have brought somestability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign tradedeficit.     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistentlyrefused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up tothe producing oil companies to set the levels of production. REUTER
EXTRACTS FROM OPEC COMMUNIQUE Following are extracts from thecommunique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conferencehere.    "The conference expressed satisfaction about the positiveresults of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by whichOPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilingsdistributed into national production levels.    "The conference noted that all market indicators, includingspot prices in the market and netback values of all OPECcrudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidatingthe OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement."    "The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for thesecond half of the year and decided that in order to securecontinued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during thefourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the thirdquarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed intothe same national production levels as were defined by theabove-mentioned agreement for that quarter."    "Furthermore, the conference decided to establish acommittee of five heads of delegation to monitor the priceevolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official pricesin order to secure price stability around the opec pricestructure.    "Should there be any significant change in market prices,the committee would immediately call for an extraordinarymeeting of the conference with a view to deciding on thenecessary OPEC production levels during the second half of theyear, which would secure the desired market stability."    "The conference reiterated the necessity of membercountries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December1986, both in terms of official price, and national production,levels.    "For this purpose, the conference decided to establish acommittee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits tomember countries in order to motivate them to comply with theterms of the agreement."    "Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of thecooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outsideOPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting marketstability.    The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the groupof five heads of delegation established by the 77th(extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 toundertake the necessary contacts with those countries.

KUWAIT SEES OPEC OUTPUT OVER CEILING TO END-YEAR OPEC output for the second half of 1987,including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mlnbarrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.    Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained itsceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quartersof 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarterlevel of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quartertarget.    Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, "OPEC thirdquarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd whilefourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd"    Ali did not detail what effect he thought these productionlevels would have on prices.    Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused toadhere to it and has recently been producing around two mlnbarrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabiaand Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted whena 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in aboutSeptember.    Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf Warenemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369mln in the second half.    Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production fromthe Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which hasbeen supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. "We willnot discuss it. There will not be any change," he said.    Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and endedSaturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problemsto be adressed. "We are overdoing it in holding too short ameeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet," he said.    Ali said the problem of price differentials between theprices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properlyat the meeting.    Ali said "The problem of differentials is a real one. Iwould hate to be producing today a light crude and that problemhas not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpricedrelative to heavy crudes."    Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at thenext OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said"If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not dothe work of another minister."    Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.    OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spreadof 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.        Reuter

CHEVRON N.SEA FIND MAY HOLD 300 MLN BBLS -ANALYSTS A North Sea oil find announced by ChevronCorp's <CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate anew field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mlnbarrels, industry analysts said.    Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 APIcrude oil from the tertiary "Alba" sand through a three-inchsurface choke.    "The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320mln barrels," Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grievesonand Co told Reuters.    He said industry estimates put the total reserves at thefield at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity ofoil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25pct.    Analysts said the results were encouraging, but thepotential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in thefield was shown by the fact that the first well had to beplugged and a sidetrack drilled.    "The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which willrequire a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costsup," Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.    Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oilfound would require additional costs in recovery, the test wellshowed that it flows well.    "Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could berecovered," Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters.    However, Chevron officials declined to comment on theanalysts' reserve estimates. They said that without furtherresearch and drilling in the area this summer, they would notdisclose any reserve figures.    Analysts said that if the field were declared commercialand developed, there would be a ready local market for theheavy crude it produced.    "Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils andthe price differentials between heavy and light crudes are alot narrower today," Osborne said.    Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies whichinclude British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons(UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int. Pet.

ECUADOR TO PRODUCE ABOVE OPEC QUOTA - MINISTER Ecuador will produce crude oil in excessof its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of thisyear, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a newsconference.    Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to320,000 bpd next January, the minister said.    "We will be producing more than the quota to pay off thecrude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria andKuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable toproduce during the past few months," he said.    Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadoreanproduction from March to May this year.    Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPECmembers during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increasein Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.    "They understood our position and we believe we remainwithin the spirit of the (quota) agreement," he said.    Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean productionwas 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.

INDONESIA SAYS IT WILL EXTEND OIL CONTRACTS Indonesia told the oil industry onTuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks andimprove the investment climate, but wants to see increasedexpenditure on exploration in return.    President Suharto, in an opening speech to the IndonesianPetroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extendcontracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.    "In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, thegovernment of Indonesia has basically approved of extendingproduction sharing contracts under the present laws," Suhartosaid.    "Apart from that, the government will keep improving theinvestment climate in order to accelerate the development ofthe petroleum industry," he said.    Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association hewas aware that the oil industry needed to be assured thatcontracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would berenewed before they would invest in further exploration.    "As we all have heard this morning, the President is fullyaware of this situation," Subroto said.    "The government has already made the political decision toentertain this time problem by inviting the existing producersto continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on aselective basis."    Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oilreserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oilindustry sources say.    Subroto said the government was also working to ease otherproblems, including granting easier terms for remote areas ordeep water conditions.    But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-wayand that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration nowthat the oil price had recovered.    President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer oftechnology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oilindustry for the regions in which companies operated.    Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil companyPertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and productionexpenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast tofall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in1986.    Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operationcontracts with foreign oil companies.    Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for fieldoperations was a government priority. There had beenmisunderstandings between the government and the oil industryin certain areas, such as when a field is designatedcommercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.    He said the government wanted to finalise contractextensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in themeantime to maintain its exploration drive.    Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintainexploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expirewithin 10 years. "This need in itself is some sort of guaranteethat we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement."    Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewalbetween 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.    Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involveddetailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.    Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensionswould be selective, based on how much capital would beinvested. REUTER
NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd inAugust, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.    Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output atseveral of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production atfields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk fieldrescue project.    Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway'svoluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oiloutput, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabiliseoil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.    Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend theproduction restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on allits North Sea fields for the rest of the year.    Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norwaywould extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.    The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, whichpumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.    Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which usethe Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August whilePhillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.    BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ulafield, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after droppingto 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.    Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpdlast month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the companysaid.    September production was also sharply higher at theStatfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, whichextends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpdagainst 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske StatsOljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.    Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, likeStatfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpdin September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previousmonth, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.    Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpdin September, compared with 100,188 in August.    Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said testoutput at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarltotalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd inAugust.    Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring onstream a second well, cutting September production to just twodays. REUTER

SOVIET 1988 OIL OUTPUT TARGET AT 625 MLN TONNES The Soviet oil production target for 1988has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes overthis year's planned output.    Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesdayat the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.    He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oildeposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed anupsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnationwhich began in late 1983.    Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.    January-September figures released at the weekend showedSoviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.    Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oildeposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geologprospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.    The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday. REUTER
US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS U.S. military planners ruled outIran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attackmounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into theIran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.    U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform andraided another in what the administration called a "measured andappropriate response" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack lastFriday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.    Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rigrather than an onshore economic or military target such asSilkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington tolimit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both athome and in the Gulf.    "It simply demonstrated the United States will take militaryaction when they (Iran) take military action," Norman Polmar, adefense analyst and author, said.    He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran theembarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoidingan escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.    In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and thepotential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft thatcould have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.    Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraqwar, said the United States apparently chose a limited targetto keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept aSecurity Council call for a ceasefire.    "We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's anychance at all," he said, adding that the action made it cleartougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagonto have been turned into a military command post -- Washingtonalso sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran'seconomic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform hadbeen used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in thelower Gulf.    "We have chosen a military target, but we also have shownIran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exportingcapabilities," Cordesman said.    He predicted the United States would respond to any futuremajor Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at BandarAbbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining theapproaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday theUnited States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, "butwe will be prepared to meet any escalation of military actionby Iran with stronger countermeasures."

EX-ARCO <ARC> CHIEF SEES ENERGY CRISIS BY 1990 Dwindling global crude oil reserves andthe lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will sendthe world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former AtlanticRichfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.    "It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks," Andersontold reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. "Ibelieve we're going to see a change in the world oil markets intwo to three years because oil is becoming harder to find."    Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oiland Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mlnbarrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.    "If you looked around the world, you could not scrape upone mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the MiddleEast," he said. "We're soon going to be right back where wewere in 1973 and 1979."    Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 atabout 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.    "There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn'tenough supply," he said. "There have been no major oildiscoveries for the past 15 to 20 years."    Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major worlddiscovery, has already produced about five billion barrels ofoil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said. Reuter

AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing onworld markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gainsthat followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in theGulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.    December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents beforefalling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.    "Fundamentals are awful," said Philip Lambert, analyst withstockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPECproduction in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mlnbpd, little changed from September levels.    Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPECproduction could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter andInternational Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC Septemberproduction at 18.5 mln bpd.    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit ofa Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the SeaIsle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flagcommercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in thearea on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil onMonday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.Attack, analysts said.    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through whicharound eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not inthe interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase inthe number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulfhostilities, analysts said.    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranianmissile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.    "The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspondto Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that anyfurther action will be met with a like-for-like response.Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory," Pyne said.    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was "aresponsible retaliation," with the U.S. Apparently indicating toIran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iranchose to raise the level of conflict.    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved asArab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose intereststhe U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as aresult of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranianretaliation.    The initial upward market move this morning reflected astrong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack whichwas thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missilelaunchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.    The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navyattack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence SecretaryCaspar Weinburger.    Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in theGulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it lessserious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,analysts and traders said.

TASS DENOUNCES U.S. ATTACK ON IRAN AS ADVENTURISM The official Soviet news agency Tassdenounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform inthe Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it wouldbring no dividends to the Reagan administration.    Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administrationhad embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflectattention from the scandal in which the United States sold armsto Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.    "The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is thatthe latest military adventure will not bring politicaldividends to the American administration," Krutikhin said.    Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier onMonday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they wereconcerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.    Soviet officials have previously criticized the UnitedStates for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying theirpresence serves to increase tension.    Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran andIraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also soughtbroader contacts with Iran in the last year.    Krutikhin said: "The United States has undertaken an act ofarmed aggression against Iran, the probability of which haslong been spoken of by Washington officials." Reuter
COASTAL SAID RAISED OIL POSTINGS 50 CTS A BARREL OCTOBER 16. WTI NOW 19.

The bank said non-recurring costs of 10.1 mln dlrsassociated with the acquisition of Rainier, a 9.5-billion-dlrSeattle-based concern, cut earnings per share by nine cents.    Security Pacific also said the suspension of interestpayments on the Brazilian and Ecuadorian debt reduced netincome by 8.1 mln dlrs, or seven cents a share.    Security Pacific completed its acquisition of Rainier onAugust 31. Security Pacific's results have been restated toreflect the "pooling-of-interests" acquisition.    "Our third-quarter performance was strong, clearlydemonstrating the stability and balance in our earningsstreams," said Richard Flamson, chairman and chief executiveofficer.

SHIPPING SOURCES SAY UNIDENTIFIED JETS RAID IRANIAN OIL PLATFORMS IN SOUTH Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the keysupplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at leastthe next five years, oil industry sources said.    Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane andbutane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on SaudiArabian LPG, the sources said.    They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associateof crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. "Saudiis a reliable supplier in that sense," said one trader.    Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.    No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as anLPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.    "Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulfcould easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilitiesin that area," said another trader.    Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant atAl-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back tocontractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports fromother ports.    Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on cruderather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPGsupply disruptions, traders said.    They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz wasunlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.    Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatlyrise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at amoderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.    Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to liftslightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports fromIndonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.    The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases inlarge scale when Japan increases annual imports of IndonesianLPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in theyear ended March 1987, the sources said.    But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase downterm purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes onthe spot market, they said.    Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under termcontracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct ofJapan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.    Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has madesome concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in therecent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely theJapanese will accept the offer, the sources said.    The Japanese term customers, however, have so far beenunsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula toreplace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.    Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified byPetromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)of Arabian Light.    Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftingsshould the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of ArabianLight's GSP.    Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,the trade sources said.    Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplyingup to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject toseller-buyer agreement.    Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cutsupplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.    "If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitablebasis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct," saidan official at a major importer. "Freight costs are higher forcargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to alonger haul and war risk insurance payments."    Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month tofinalise their separate contract talks, now focusing oncontractual period and volume, which could be very similar tocurrent levels, the sources said. "When we talk business, wewould seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability ofhigh dependence on a single supplier," said one. REUTER

Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S<AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build thewell-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to standin 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.    Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than afixed platform would cut construction time, enabling fieldpartners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- severalmonths earlier than previously planned.    Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mlnbarrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 kmwest of Bergen.    Statoil estimates the field's total development cost,including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily outputis 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.    Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Osebergfield pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gaswill be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas fromNorway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.    Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55pct share, <Unocal Norge A/S> (18 pct), <Deminex (Norge) A/S>(13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S <NHY.OL> (nine pct) and <SvenskaPetroleum AB> (4.5 pct).

IRAN, SOVIET UNION TO SWAP CRUDE, REFINED PRODUCTS The Soviet Union has agreed to supplyIran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrelsper day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said.    IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister GholamrezaAqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that theagreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signedduring his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the SovietUnion might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.    Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibilitystudies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields insouthern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.    Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part ofits oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.    Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the SovietUnion, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before heleft for Moscow.    Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulfwar and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refinedproducts.    Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered atthe Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near theCaspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran. REUTER
