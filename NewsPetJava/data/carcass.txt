CHICKEN NOT MAIN SALMONELLA CAUSE, OFFICIAL SAYS A representative of the poultryindustry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequentlythe cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products orsalads and other mixed foods.    Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industriesand a director of the National Broiler Council, told a HouseAgriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chickenhas not increased in recent years and that chicken is neitherthe major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of anincrease in outbreaks of the disease.    May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed thatbetween 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of allU.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pctof outbreaks and dairy products six pct.    May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads andmixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.    May said the chicken industry favored moving away frombird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment systembetter able to identify microbial and bacterial contaminationof poultry.    However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice forFood and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should beretained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cookchicken to remind consumers about preparation proceduresnecessary to avoid illness.    Haas also called for a review of present chicken industryinspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards. Reuter
EX-USDA OFFICIAL URGES CHICKEN HANDLING LABELS A former U.S. Agriculture Departmentofficial urged the department to require that packages ofchicken be labeled with handling and cooking instructions toprotect the public from disease.    Carol Tucker Foreman, President of Foreman and Heidepriemand a former assistant secretary of agriculture for food andconsumer services, told a House Agriculture subcommittee, "everyhour of every day, 22 Americans become victims of chickencontaminated with salmonella."    She said every two and a half weeks, an American dies ofsalmonellosis or complications arising from it and theincidence of poisoning from poultry has increased steadily overthe past several years.    Foreman said USDA should follow a National Academy ofSciences recommendation to label chicken packages to remindconsumers of preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness.    She urged USDA to require that birds be washed thoroughlybefore they are defeathered and that defeathering machines becleaned several times a day, that birds be condemned if theirintestines are punctured or there is visible fecalcontamination and that chiller water be changed more often.    Kenneth Blaylock, President of the American Federation ofGovernment Employees, said a poultry industry recommendation tomove away from the current bird-by-bird inspection could prove"disastrous." He said a strengthened bird-by-bird inspection withslower line speeds was the foundation upon which new inspectiontechniques should be overlaid. Reuter

U.S. MEAT INDUSTRY LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN IN JAPAN The U.S. meat industry has launched anaggressive promotion campaign in Japan to increase consumerawareness of U.S. beef and persuade the Japanese government torelax current beef import quotas.    U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrsannually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as highas six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas wereremoved and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of theattributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat ExportFederation said at a press conference today.    Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through theAgriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA)program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan waslaunched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April.    "The promising Japanese beef market could be one of thebright spots for U.S. agricultural exports," said Philip Seng,Asian Director for the Federation. "We supply and they (Japan)buy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want tobuy more," he said.    Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limitstotal Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S.imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expandingU.S. beef shipments to Japan.    The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavyJapanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreementexpires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to getunderway this fall.    The Reagan administration has called for an end to thequotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said theywould not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure.    Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters thatthey do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but thatthey hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota.    High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected markethas also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industryofficials said.    Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S.tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrsfor a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat associationsaid. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrsper pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb.    Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beefper year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American,officials said.    Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700,000 to 800,000tonnes per year, but Seng said with the removal of quotas and adecrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mlntonnes. Reuter
