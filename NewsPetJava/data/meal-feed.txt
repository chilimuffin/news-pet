FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT The sharp decline in soybean crush ratiosseen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, haspushed margins below the cost of production at most soybeanprocessing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybeanmeal and oil.    The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by theNational Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen overthe past two months when crush margins surged to the bestlevels seen in over a year.    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushedsoybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in theweekly crush number.    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surgein shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the nextfew months.    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feeddemand is very light for this time of year due to the milderthan normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices inan attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recentweeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in thenearby March contract today.    "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and soldMay, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crushtrader said.    "But they've been bailing out this week because the Marchhas been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if nottomorrow, then later in the month," he added.    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crushratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents perbushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last twodays.    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so noprocessors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitablelevel, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cutback production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.    With futures down, processors are finding they must bidpremiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 centsfor every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, downsharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and belowthe average cost of production, cash dealers said.    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, withlittle talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. Butprocessors will start halting production in the next few weeksit they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added. Reuter
INDONESIA UNLIKELY TO IMPORT PHILIPPINES COPRA Indonesia is unlikely to import coprafrom the Philippines in 1987 after importing 30,000 tonnes in1986, the U.S. Embassy's annual agriculture report said.    The report said the 31 pct devaluation of the Indonesianrupiah, an increase in import duties on copra and increases inthe price of Philippines copra have reduced the margin betweenprices in the two countries.    Indonesia's copra production is forecast at 1.32 mln tonnesin calendar 1987, up from 1.30 mln tonnes in 1986. REUTER
INDONESIAN SOYBEAN IMPORTS FORECAST TO RISE Soybean imports are forecast to rise to425,000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated300,000 in 1986/87 and 375,000 in 1985/86, the U.S. Embassysaid in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture.    It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal ofself-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because itdid not meet a planned increase in area planted and becauseyields have remained below target.    Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000tonnes in 1985/86.    Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.    Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but torise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due tocome on stream in early 1988.    China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while theU.S. Provides the rest, it said.    "This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 sincedomestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and arewilling to pay a premium for them," it said.    Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both1986/87 and 1987/88.    "Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficientsupply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems,"the report said. REUTER

SOVIET SOYMEAL IMPORTS SEEN RISING IN 1987 Soviet imports of soymeal may reach orexceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year,the Oil World newsletter said.    Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reducesoybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.    At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from theEuropean Community and South America in the January/Marchquarter, with additional large quantities likely to be importedin the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, itsaid. No figures were given for imports in the correspondingperiods of 1986.    The change made sense in view of the recent purchases ofprobably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseedand large scale butter imports that were expected from Marchonward, it said.    Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grainarea due to recent severe frosts were probably behind therecent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.    It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn hadbeen bought recently by the Soviet Union. Reuter
USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES  Corn sales gained 2,494,900 tonnes inthe week ended February 26, the highest weekly total sinceAugust 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week'slevel, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department saidsales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reportedunder the daily reporting system -- were the first sales fordelivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSRGrains Supply Agreement, which began October 1.    Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and salesto unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.    Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half fromthe previous week's combined sales, it said.    Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers fordelivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1.    Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled thepreceding week, but were nearly a third below the four weekaverage. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexicoand Italy, it said.    Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct lessthan the four week average.    Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy andAustralia were partially offset by declines to unknowndestinations.    Soybean oil sales of 5,400 tonnes were the result ofincreases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes forunknown destinations.    Combined sales activity in cotton of 75,200 running bales-- 44,700 bales for the current year and 30,500 bales for the1987/88  bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's goodshowing, the department said.

WEST GERMAN FISHMEAL IMPORTS HIGHEST IN 15 YEARS West German gross fishmeal imports rose60,260 tonnes, or 14.6 pct, last year to 471,891 tonnes, thehighest level since 1972, trade sources said.    Re-exports fell by 6.6 pct, resulting in a surge in netimports from 175,901 to 251,708 tonnes, an increase of 43 pct.    Total West German consumption was estimated at around ahigh 287,000 tonnes, largely reflecting attractive prices. Thesources, however, could not give comparative figures for 1985.    South American producer countries supplied 97 pct of WestGerman requirements, with Chile shipping 229,176 tonnes (1985 -182,959) and Peru 210,513 (147,014) tonnes.

U.S. CORN GROWERS BLAST CANADA CORN RULING Canada's ruling in favor of a duty onU.S. corn was a keen disappointment to the National CornGrowers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for othernations to follow, said Mike Hall, lobbyist for theassociation.    "The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now andjust change corn to corn gluten feed" in their complaint, Halltold Reuters.    A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farmpolicies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers andsupported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85cts per bushel.    "This was cleary a political decision," Hall said. "Theamount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant."    The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrumentthat Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices andthat American farm policy has driven down these prices, thuscausing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger governmentpayments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.    Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but thatother nations might also now apply this same argument to attackU.S. farm programs.    The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farmprograms create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hallsaid. The French have long wanted to control the imports ofU.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that theimported feed was unfairly displacing European grain. Reuter
EC FARM LIBERALISATION SEEN HURTING THAI TAPIOCA Any European Community decision toliberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapiocaindustry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at theThailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).    He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move tocut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops morecompetitive than tapioca in the European market.    The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing morethan two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported byThailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25mln tonnes a year until 1990.    Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariffloophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pctimport duty.    Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI,suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops.    He said: "If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they areclose to world prices, the tapioca market there will disappearcompletely."    He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because ithad recently joined other major commodity producers in callingon the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies. REUTER
SOUTH AMERICAN FISH MEAL PRODUCTION AT RECORD HIGH Production of fish meal by the threeSouth American producers -- Chile, Peru and Equador -- lastyear reached 2.5 mln tonnes, equalling the record output of1970, the International Association of Fish Meal Manufacturers(IAFMM) said.    However, IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chileanand Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987to be much lower than the 651,000 tonnes produced in the lastquarter of 1986, due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile forthe month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peruin the same month.    The statement added that, due to technical market promotionand energetic sales by Chile and Peru, the stock position atthe end of the year remained reasonable.    Fish meal production outside South America decreasedslightly, falling from 114,400 to 111,100 tonnes.    The IAFMM said fish meal consumption in 1986 rose in WestGermany, Scandinavian countries, Eastern Europe and the FarEast, but fell in the U.S. And remained static in the U.K.    It added that fish meal consumption had suffered fromcompetition with feed grade tallow in the U.S. And with skimmedmilk powder in the U.K.    IAFMM figures for fish oil production in the main producingnations, in thousands of tonnes, were -                    Oct/Dec            Jan/Dec                 1986    1985       1986     1985 CHILE             22       8        109       76 PERU              56      28        238      104 NORWAY            14      14         97      130 ICELAND           44      52        102      118 DENMARK           20      18         88       77 U.S.              10       8        152      129 JAPAN             67      91        213      249 REUTER

USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT  U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mlntonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the priorweek, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, thedepartment said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largestbuyers.    Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.    Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season andnet reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season werefour-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and thefour-week average, it said.    Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination withpurchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.    Other significant purchasers for the current year wereMexico and Honduras, it said.    Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below theprior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.    Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the majorpurchasers, the department said.    Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-weekaverage. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, theNetherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset byreductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.    Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, theDepartment said.    Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's levelbut nine pct below the four-week average.    Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followedby Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.

DUTCH FEED COMPOUNDER STARTS CASE AGAINST EC LEVY A major animal feed producer, CehaveNV Veghel (CHV), has begun legal proceedings against theapplication of the European Community grain co-responsibilitylevy, with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feedtrade association, Het Comite, association chief executivePeter Pex told Reuters.    Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and thecourt said it would give its verdict within six weeks. "However,that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court torefer questions on the interpretation and application of thelevy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg," Pex added.    Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not takeaccount of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean acompounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy inits own national currency than it received down the chain fromthe original producer of the grain.    "We would like the Business Administration Court in theHague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whetherthe Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but alsowhether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,"Pex said.    "It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,but we have had no political help, and therefore have no optioneven though it could take years," Pex added.    Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against thegrain levy because the bill the company received from thecommodity board included grain from a wide variety of originsand was therefore considered to be the best general basis for alegal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.    Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions onthe levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a casebrought by the Association of European Animal FeedManufacturers, FEFAC. REUTER

WEST GERMAN TAPIOCA USE SEEN DECLINING West German use of tapioca is likely todecline further despite favourable prices and import licencesfor only 420,000 tonnes have been registered since the start ofthe current agricultural year, compared with 640,000 tonnesduring August/April the previous year, trade sources said.    The 12 European Community (EC) countries have licensed atotal of 4.22 mln tonnes, while at the same year-earlier periodthe EC contracted for 3.17 mln tonnes, they said.    The Netherlands is registering an increase in licences toaround 2.9 mln tonnes, up 400,000 tonnes from last year, theysaid.    Total EC tapioca imports during the current agriculturalyear are expected to stagnate at last year's level of around6.0 mln tonnes, the sources said.    They reported a rise in consumption and in import licencesfor France, Spain and Belgium but said the West German compoundfeed industry was increasingly using grain in feed mixtures.    Sellers quoted tapioca for nearby delivery at around 27marks per 100 kilos against 37 marks in March and 34 marks inApril last year.    Feed barley was quoted at about 42 marks per 100 kilos,resulting in higher West German feed stuff prices, but demandwas seen as slack.    The sources said the West German feed industry was tryingto help cut the grain surplus through increased use of grain infeed mixtures.    Other EC member countries are likely to take advantage ofthe lower tapioca prices, they said. REUTER
PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later thismonth to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.    "I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is puttingup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countrieslike the Philippines," Romero said in an interview.    He said he did not know how much support the levy hadwithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposedto the tax were under pressure to change their position.    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, theNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. Butthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to changesides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warningthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds containeddangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin permillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked toapply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copracake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when itis not properly dried or ground.    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal inLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet ECstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,but this was likely to take several years of research.    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of totalcoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University'sdepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways ofavoiding the copra process altogether.    "There are ways of producing coconut products outside ofcopra," Romero said. "We can process fresh coconut without dryingthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can processcoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go tothe chemical root."    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries tobecome more protectionist and he expected export prices ofcoconut products to drop.    "In the long term we will be getting less and less for moreand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that," hesaid.    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping upproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oiloutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.    "To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spendingbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil bysaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,"he said.    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices tostay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests.    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, toadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.    "Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought theprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keepprices stable is by processing, adding more value," he said.    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop byplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.    "A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space," Romerosaid. He said the government's proposed land reform programwould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because theyhad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.    "If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,production and employment then it won't happen," he said.    PCA figures show about one-third of the country'spopulation is dependent on the coconut industry.    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares orone-fourth of total agricultural land. REUTER
SOYCOMPLEX COULD RALLY ON TIGHT U.S. FEED SUPPLY Nearby months in soybean and soymealfutures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply oflivestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep thenew crop outlook bearish, traders said.    "A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worriedabout where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,"one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.    Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers forthe few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with aDecatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bidanother two cents today to 10 over July futures.    Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willingto sell, dealers said.    Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the beliefthat even if futures rally back to last month's highs, countrymovement may remain light because farmers in many areas aresold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern halfof the Midwest.    Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtimefor maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducingthe weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping thespot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.    Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help Julysoybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal hasalready moved to a premium over the August through Octobermonths and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may alsomove to a July premium later this month, they added. Reuter
HOT WEATHER PUSHES CBT GRAINS TO NEW HIGHS Hot, dry weather over the Midwest, withmore forecast, pushed grain futures prices to new highs todayon the Chicago Board of Trade.    Soybean futures led the advance, closing up the30-cent-per-bushel daily trading limit in contracts fordelivery after this year's fall harvest. All months setlife-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs abushel.    "The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter thannormal for some time out," said David Bartholomew, assistantvice president for Merrill Lynch. "We have probably gone ashigh as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how tomeasure the euphoria level."    Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week,posted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limitin new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs.    Corn futures set contract highs in March through September,with December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4dlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improvedharvest conditions in the southern Midwest.    The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybeanplants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefityoung plants by encouraging the development of deep rootsystems, Bartholomew said.    European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed toactive buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybeanorders went unfilled at the close, traders said.    After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)meteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have notsuffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather.    Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of thedollar, which can depress prices by making grains moreexpensive for foreign buyers.    But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York'sCOMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settlesteady.    Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that theweather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears ofinflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures,which closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S.trade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices.    A USDA report released after trading said the number ofcattle being fed in seven major producing states was abovelevels expected by traders. Traders said the report wouldprobably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the ChicagoMercantile Exchange.    USDA put cattle-on-feed in the seven major states at 7.52mln head, 106 pct of a year ago and at the high end of tradeforecasts.    A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May,up 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said.    Cattle futures closed mixed in choppy trading today as hotweather slowed consumer demand for red meat, traders said. Reuter
JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pctto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pctfrom 2.1 pct. REUTER

OILMEAL DEMAND STILL STRONG IN U.S., SOVIET UNION Oilmeal demand remained strong in theUnited States in July and August and six pct up on levels seenin the same months last year, with most of the rise coming insoymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose toa record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pcton the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal atseven pct, it said.    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago monthsfollowing a huge increase in soymeal imports.    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediatelybut went into stocks. With imports again large in September, itestimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes byOctober 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a yearearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due tobumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposalswere reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mlnat that time last year.
