JANUARY HOUSING SALES DROP, REALTY GROUP SAYS Sales of previously owned homesdropped 14.5 pct in January to a seasonally adjusted annualrate of 3.47 mln units, the National Association of Realtors(NAR) said.    But the December rate of 4.06 mln units had been thehighest since the record 4.15 mln unit sales rate set inNovember 1978, the group said.    "The drop in January is not surprising considering that asignificant portion of December's near-record pace was made upof sellers seeking to get favorable capital gains treatmentunder the old tax laws," said the NAR's John Tuccillo.

U.S. HOUSING DATA FAIL TO CLARIFY ECONOMIC PATH Surprisingly strong U.S. housingstatistics for February cannot be taken as an indication thatthe economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficientcause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth,economists said.    Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusuallymild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said thatseasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to theeconomy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. Andafter a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.    U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to aseasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April1986.    The rate at which permits were issued for future buildingclimbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.    "February's weather is usually more adverse for homebuilding. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult todetermine what this means for the economy down the road," saidAllan Leslie of Discount Corp.    The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate forweather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperaturesinflate the statistics.    Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur tobuilding last month. But several believe that rates will nowconsolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.    "Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying'Let's do it now'," said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League ofSavings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply muchof the financing for home building.    But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downwardpotential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the U.S. economy.    He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in earlysummer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. LastNovember, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.    As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated inthe single-family sector. The multi-family area -- whichtypically represents rental units -- remained weak due to highvacancy rates and increased capital costs of such unitsfollowing tax law changes effective January 1.    Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317mln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.    "Strength in the single-family sector indicates that lowmortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably notlooking at a great deal of growth potential," said WardMcCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    McCarthy noted that the housing report, together withlarger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrialoutput and retail sales in February, may cause some observersto start waving "four pct GNP banners" for the first quarter.Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.    But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP tocome in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is notconvinced that growth will pick up in future.    "The big story is the inventory re-building that's going onnow, not all of which is intentional," he said. For example,U.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in Februarycompared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.    Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the firstquarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weakergrowth in the second, he said.    "If most of the first quarter growth is inventory buildingand we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, thenthere is the potential for softness in the second quarter,"agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluatingfirst quarter GNP prospects.    Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week thatcurrent data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.    "At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in thefirst quarter, we could foresee production slowing in thesecond," cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and MaffeiInc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.

JAPAN HOUSING STARTS RISE IN FEBRUARY Japan's housing starts in February rose13.4 pct from a year earlier to 109,254, the 10th successiveyear-on-year gain, the Construction Ministry said.    February housing starts were up 16.8 pct from 93,554 inJanuary when they fell 27.4 pct from a month earlier but rose10.3 pct from a year earlier.    Higher housing starts were mainly due to a 26.8 pctyear-on-year rise in apartment building starts to 51,829 forthe 56th consecutive gain, spurred primarily by lower domesticinterest rates. RUTER

BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING A trade-led boom in the U.S. isunlikely this year or next because growth in net exports willmerely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending andother sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in itslatest economic report.    Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending willcontribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.    As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.    "Growth in consumer spending in the United States will dropdramatically this year because the jump in inflation will causea falloff in the growth of disposable income," Van Dyke said.    Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.    The report was released before the Commerce Departmentreported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personalconsumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared witha 0.6 pct increase the month before.    The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boostconsumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.    This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.    As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing powerof an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrsthis year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.    The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housingstarts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.    "For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988or 1989 is more than a remote possibility," Van Dyke said.    Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on animprovement in trade. "However, with protectionist attitudes onthe rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk," headded. Reuter
INTEREST RATES HURT U.S. MAY HOUSING SALES Sales of new single-family homestumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of highermortgage interest rates, analysts said.    "There should be another month or two of very weak new homesales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homesshould become more stable by mid-summer," said economistLawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.    The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the CommerceDepartment said.    Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out atabout 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.    The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers outof the market, he and others said.    "The rates moved very suddenly and were certainlyunexpected by homebuyers," said Cynthia Latta, an economistwith Data Resources. "They were so startled, they wanted tohold back and see what would happen."    The drop in sales of new single-family home sales wassharper than expected, some economists said. "We fully expecteda decline but the extent was more than we anticipated," saidJames Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions.    Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales ofexisting homes, which are generally less expensive than newhomes.    Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of newcondominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast werereflected in sales of existing but not new homes.    Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said,"Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the marketis going to stabilize and give us a good second half."    Others were less optimistic, however.    "We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but Idon't think this is the start of a collapse in single-familyhousing," said Chimerine of Wharton.    Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home LoanBank of New York, said, "The lower sales level will bemaintained for awhile until there is another change in rates.There won't be much specific improvement in coming months."
