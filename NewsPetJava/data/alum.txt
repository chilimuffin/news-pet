ALCAN TO CLOSE WEST GERMAN ALUMINIUM SMELTER <Alcan AluminiumwerkeGmbH>, a subsidiary of Alcan Aluminium Ltd <AL.N> of Canada,said it plans to close its aluminium smelter in Ludwigshafen atthe end of June.    A spokesman said Alcan was closing the smelter, with annualcapacity of 44,000 tonnes and 320 employees, because of highelectricity costs and the low world market price of aluminium.    Alkan had said earlier this year it would close half theplant's capacity but decided to shut down completely when talkswith potential cooperation partners failed, the spokesman said.He declined to name the other companies involved in the talks.

ALCAN, BERTONE MAKE ALUMINUM STRUCTURE CAR Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it joined withCarrozzeria Bertone S.P.A. to exhibit Alcan's technology inaluminum structured vehicles at Geneva's international autosalon.    Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheetaluminum. It said the bodies were made on presses used forBertone's steel-structured sports cars.    Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested inBritain by the Motor Industry Research Association.     Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminumstructure technology so that it is suitable for modern automaking methods and plants.    Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of acar's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling andperformance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. Itsaid the structures also provide long life without the need forrust protection.    The structure provides the same stiffness and safety aspresent materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said. Reuter

KENTUCKY SMELTERS GET RELIEF ON HIGHER RATES Owners of two aluminum smelters inKentucky received temporary relief from higher electric ratesafter a decision Tuesday by state regulators denying a ratehike to (Big Rivers Electric Corp) of Henderson, Ky.    But the owners of the smelters, (National SouthwireAluminum Co) and Alcan Aluminium Ltd <AL>, said furtherviability of the operations would depend in part upon how therate case is eventually settled.    "We're hoping for no rate increases but we can't say forsure. It's still possible we'll have to close the smelter," aNational Southwire spokesman said. He said there were othervariables to consider in any decision whether to close orcontinue the smelter, located in Hawesville, about 60 mileswest of Louisville.    National Southwire is owned by National Intergroup Inc<NII>, which holds about 55 pct, and (Southwire Co), whichholds the rest, the spokesman said.

"But we're delighted that Big Rivers Electric wasdenied the requested rate increase."    A spokesman for the utility, a cooperative that generatesand wholesales electricity to four distributors, said therequested increase was 7.5 mln dlrs a year over 1985 rates.    The Kentucky Public Service Commission, in denying theincrease, asked the utility to meet with creditors, whichinclude Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and Irving Bank Corp<V>, and the smelters, to renegotiate a rate plan, the utilityspokesman said.

ALUMINIUM SCRAP RECOVERY AND USAGE TO RISE Aluminium scrap recovery and usage andoutput of secondary metal will continue to rise, said ShearsonLehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium marketwhich details cost and demand factors.    Although primary smelting costs have declined generally inrecent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offeredby secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted materialincreasingly attractive.    It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricityto produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said.    On the demand side, developments in automobiles andpackaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.    Automobile production, although expected to fall this year,is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for theforeseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castingsis gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry,particularly in the U.S.    In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium todominate the beverage can market in any of the other majoreconomies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there isevidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.    In addition to the cost savings involved, technologyadvances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced bythe secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.    There is not likely to be a problem of availability as theU.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true ofseveral European countries, albeit on a smaller scale. Reuter

ALUMINIUM CAPACITY GROWTH TREND SEEN INSUFFICIENT Aluminium capacity expansion planned forthe period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply anyacceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on thescale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony BirdAssociates' 1987 Aluminium Review.    By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need tobe around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mlntonnes are scheduled, Bird said.    Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 andincreased imports by less developed countries.    Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerateby as much as general growth, but non-socialist worldconsumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Birdsaid.    Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace ofchange after 1973, the review said, and now they have completedthis transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupiedwith the strategies of retrenchment and survival which haveserved them well in recent years.    In order to encourage the construction of additionalsmelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higherlevel.    Production costs are likely to rise again in the yearsahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricitysuppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies,according to the review.    At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-pricescenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said.    Such a price development is not expected to cause anymarked competitive problems for the metal because of the likelyrise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in thepipeline for steel and copper.    In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said,as the world economy has not responded well to theopportunities offered by cheap oil.    Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higherin 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes. Reuter

INDONESIA RAISES STAKE IN ALUMINIUM PLANT Indonesia has increased its share in a434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from25 to 37 pct, Asahan Project Authority director A.R. Suhudsaid.    The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raisedits share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company,capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yenin government loans to the company for an equity stake.    The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas EconomicCooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.    Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yendebt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciationof the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold indollars.    Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago toabout 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even ifprices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.    Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes ayear, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant,situated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan. REUTER
JAPAN APPROVES AID FOR INDONESIA, BRAZIL ALUMINIUM Japan's cabinet approved a plan to helpfinancially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia andBrazil, an official at the Ministry of International and TradeIndustry (MITI) said.    Japan will invest 24 billion yen in <PT Indonesia AsahanAluminium> in addition to the 68.3 billion yen already investedin the company. The government and private interests willequally share the additional investment, he said.    They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen innew investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project inBrazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested.    The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans toAsahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, theofficial said.    Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the twoprojects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from thecurrent seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to bereached, industry sources said.    Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billionyen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32billion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia'sinvestment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct.    The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest anadditional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment nowtotals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51pct, the official said.    The sources said the rescue programs for the two projectswere larger than earlier expected, reflecting Japan's desire tohelp develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and tostabilise sources of aluminium.    Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of itsaluminium demand, which totals some 1.8 mln tonnes a year, theysaid. REUTER
CHINA ALUMINIUM VENTURE AIMS AT SOUTH KOREA China and Australia's Victoria statesigned a joint venture contract for a 290 mln dlr aluminiumprocessing plant in China that will export to South Korea,Australian officials told journalists.    China has no official direct trade or government ties withSeoul, while it maintains close links with North Korea.

Victoria's <Aluvic Ltd>, on behalf of the state government,will hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project, which isintended as a sister plant to Victoria's Portland aluminiumsmelter. CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs inPortland.    The China-based joint venture would process Portlandaluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domesticChinese market as well as for export, Jolly said.    The Australian side's investment was limited to about 22mln dlrs, but Aluvic would have the right to appoint keymanagers, he said.    Australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generatedby their participation would lead to further CITIC investmentin Victoria. The Chinese group enjoys a high level ofindependence from Peking's central government and has extensiveoverseas investments. REUTER
