ANTIBIOTICS IN FEED AID DEADLY BACTERIA: STUDY A study of salmonella poisoning hasuncovered new evidence that the common practice of feedingantibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria thatcan infect humans and resist medicines.    Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Controltracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that isresistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link theresulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promotethe growth of cattle.    Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply ofantibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics havebeen warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugsis helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.    Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseasesthat develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affecthumans.    But the new study, reported in Thursday's New EnglandJournal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.    The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the numberof people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistantinfection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half thevictims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalizedfor their illness.    They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't alwaysprevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eatingraw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, "themajority of cases appear to have been caused by eatinghamburger that was at least partially cooked."    The researchers said the results show that "food animals area major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infectionsin humans, and that these infections are associated with(antibiotic) use on farms."

U.K. OFFICIALS STUDY SALMONELLA/CALF FEED LINK U.K. Officials are studying the possiblelink between the use of antibiotics in calf feeds and thespread of drug-resistant strains of salmonella in humans, aMinistry of Agriculture official said.    A study published in the New England Journal of Medicineyesterday stated that the spread of an unusual strain ofsalmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol hadbeen shown to be linked to farms that used the drug to promotethe growth of cattle.   The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with theDepartment of Health and the Public Health Laboratory toinvestigate the whole subject of resistant strains ofsalmonella.    "The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possibleeffects on human and animal health," the official said. Thegovernment is also studying a recommendation from the FarmAnimal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calvesunder 56 days old through markets. The FAWC says this wouldhelp reduce the spread of salmonella. Reuter
USDA TO CONDUCT SURVEY FOR AVIAN INFLUENZA U.S. Agriculture Department animalhealth officials are conducting a national survey of live-birdmarkets and auctions to check for signs of avian influenza, aninfectious viral disease of poultry, the department said.    The survey will locate poultry dealers and live-birdmarkets that sell live birds directly to the consumer and oncethe dealers and markets are identified, there will be tests todetermine any past or present exposure to avian influenzaviruses, it said.    In 1983-84, an outbreak of avian influenza in Pennsylvania,Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey cost taxpayers 65 mln dlrs tocontrol and required the destruction of more than 17 mln birds,it said.    The survey is expected to be completed by April 15. Reuter
