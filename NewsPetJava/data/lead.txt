HOUSTON METALS' MINE YIELDS POSITIVE RESULTS <Houston Metals Corp> said thethe first phase of the underground rehabilitation, extensivedrilling and bulk sampling program at its Silver Queen Mine hasyielded positive results.    Houston said representative assays from the 2,750 ft and2,600 ft levels at the south end of the mine established oredeposits in the following ranges: copper, 3.7 pct to 5.08 pct,lead .99 pct to 1.5 pct, zinc six pct to 9.6 pct, silver 15.63pct to 79.92 oz per ton, gold .062 to .19 oz per ton, germanium93 to 103 grams per ton, gallium five to 18 grams per ton.    In addition, Houston Metals said the weighted average of 25diamond-drilled holes 375 ft below the 2,600 foot level and 800ft along the strike assayed gold at .237 oz per ton, silver at10.91 oz per ton and zinc at 8.99 pct.    An apparent parallel vein structure at the 2,600 ft levelreturned similar values, the company said.    It added that preliminary metallurgical tests fromrepresentative bulk ore samples indicate the commercialfeasability of producing a zinc and a copper-lead concentrate.    Houston Metals said gold, silver and the base metals haverecoveries of 90 pct to 95 pct, with 95 pct of gold recoveredfrom better gold ores, while gallium, germanium and indium haverecoveries of between 66 pct to 82 pct and are included in thezinc concentrate.    The company's 1987 program of diamond drilling, undergrounddrifting and metallurgical evaluation is scheduled to start onApril.    Houston Metals said it has a 60 pct interest in the SilverQueen mines.

FINNS AND CANADIANS TO STUDY MTBE PRODUCTION PLANT Finland's national oil company Neste Oy<NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firmsto study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton,Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.    The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mlnCanadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether(MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.    The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese CanadaInc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe LineCompany Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.    The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materialsavailability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and theimportant capital and operating advantages gained by locatingon an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.    The partners would look into the feasibility of a plantproducing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancerthat can replace tetra ethyl lead.    Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United Stateswhere lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because ofhealth concerns, the statement added.    Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as theU.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination inCanada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,it said.    Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over fivebillion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has amajor investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.    The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go onstream in late 1989, the statement said. REUTER
LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS Lead prices have risen this week againsta background of a finely balanced physical sector, traderssaid.    Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buyingor if labour problems develop in North America, they added.    London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant ata time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening andprices tending to drift lower.    This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the lowlevel of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physicaldemand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.    The supply problems are not new but are beginning to befelt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traderssaid.    The lower supply levels result from a number of differentfactors around the globe.    Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countriesbecause of production and transport problems, lack of Spanishexports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter atLinares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meantadditional demand being directed to merchants who in turn havebeen drawing on LME stocks.    In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeksfor maintenance. Although the company said it would meetcommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnesper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocksand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within theU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production anda regular supplier to the world market.    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held upquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reportedin the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in thefirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buyingorder was filled by merchants in March.    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead pricesthis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg andestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three monthsdelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal inGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is oftena target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerpand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,and this is believed to be in strong hands.    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowestlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouseswhich are not popular with merchants putting togethershipments.    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes sincethe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due tosecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed suppliesaffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions onthe transport of used batteries.    Labour negotiations in North America will play an importantpart in determining the direction of prices, with contractsexpiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.    Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contractexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view ofstrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attractingspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on currentfirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premiumto 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg atmidsession. Reuter

However, leaders of the negotiating teams are trying to setup an informal meeting to discuss the stalemate, said JohnOwens, spokesman for United Steelworkers of America local 480,which is one of three locals that represents 2,600 productionand maintenance workers.    Owens also said Cominco has said the strike is costing itfive mln Canadian dlrs a day in debt service costs that are notcovered by revenue. He said the company has not estimated totallost revenue and Cominco spokesmen were not immediatelyavailable for comment.    The strike, which began May nine, also involves two localsthat represent 600 office and technical workers.    The production and maintenance workers three weeks agorejected a tentative three-year agreement that provided cost ofliving adjustments but no basic wage increase.    Each of the five locals has a separate contract thatexpired April 30, but the main issues are similar.    The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine atKimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most forprocessing at the Trail smelter. Reuter
NORANDA IN TALKS WITH BRUNSWICK LEAD-ZINC MINERS Noranda Inc said contract talks resumedwith about 1,600 unionized workers at its 63 pct-ownedBrunswick Mining and Smelter Corp lead-zinc mine and leadsmelter at Bathurst, New Brunswick.    A Noranda official said talks involved both the mine andsmelter union locals, which are part of the United Steelworkersof America.    The mineworkers' contract expires July 1. They will vote onJune 22 either to authorize a strike or ratify a possiblecontract offer. The smelter workers' pact expires July 21.    The Brunswick mine produced 413,800 tonnes of zinc and206,000 tonnes of lead last year at a recovery rate of 70.5 pctzinc and 55.6 pct lead. Concentrates produced were 238,000tonnes of zinc and 81,000 tonnes of lead. Reuter

ZINC CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTFALL SEEN IN 1988 Next year is likely to see a shortfallin zinc concentrates of up to 100,000 tonnes, although thereshould be ample supply in 1987, Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltdmetals analyst Stephen Briggs said.    Speaking on the second day of Metal Bulletin's base metalsconference, Briggs said the major factor in his predicted100,000 tonne shortfall in zinc concentrate supply in 1988 wasthe imminent cessation of new mining and termination of millingat Pine Point in Canada.    However, this could be partially offset by some stockpiles.    Nevertheless, despite this predicted shortfall there wasunlikely to be any dramatic change in treatment charges in1988. The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one ofrecord production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipatedin Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacityin South Korea.    "Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are alsoexpected in 1987," Briggs said.    This would partly be due to a return to more normal levelsat existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied withachievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faroin Canada.    Looking further forward, the major event was the probableopening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacityof 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year.    "Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that therewill be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s," headded.    The picture for lead was also closely allied to that ofzinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and thereforesupply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products fromzinc mines.    "On this basis, our calculations point to a modestoversupply of lead concentrates in 1987," Briggs said.    The copper forecast, however, was for a recordnon-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987,increasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988.    Production of primary refined copper metal would alsoincrease, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading toa moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnesthis year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of thedecade, he said.

VESSEL LOST IN PACIFIC WAS CARRYING LEAD The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrierCumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, wascarrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.    He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.    Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange saidthe vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New SouthWales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morningtrading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamentalnews due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and lowstocks.    Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentratescould convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although thisdepended on the quality of the concentrates.    A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supplypipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Suppliesthere have been very tight this year and there is a strike atone major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently beingheld at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining andSmelting Ltd.

NORANDA BRUNSWICK MINERS VOTE MONDAY ON CONTRACT Noranda Inc said 1,100 unionized workersat its 63 pct-owned Brunswick Mining and Smelter Corp lead-zincmine in New Brunswick would start voting Monday on a tentativecontract pact.    Company official Andre Fortier said "We are hopeful that wecan settle without any kind of work interruption."    Fortier added that Brunswick's estimated 500 unionizedsmelter workers were currently meeting about a Noranda contractproposal and would probably vote next week. The mine's contractexpires July 1 and the smelter's on July 21.    The Brunswick mine produced 413,800 tonnes of zinc and206,000 tonnes of lead last year at a recovery rate of 70.5 pctzinc and 55.6 pct lead. Concentrates produced were 238,000tonnes of zinc and 81,000 tonnes of lead. Reuter

A company spokesman said the company and union metinformally Tuesday but talks did not constitute a formalbargaining session. The last formal talks were on June 5.    The workers went on strike May 9 and production has beenshut down since then.    The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine atKimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore in 1986, most forprocessing at the Trail smelter.    Reuter
U.S. MINERALS <USMX.O> COMMISSIONS NEW GOLD MINE U.S. Minerals Exploration Co said it andPegasus Gold Inc <PGUL.O> of Spokane, Wash, officiallycommissioned a new gold, zinc and lead producing mine.    U.S. Minerals said the new Montana Tunnels Mine nearHelena, Mont, is expected to reach full production in August1987. U.S. Minerals said the mine is designed to operate at anaverage of 12,500 tons or ore per day and is projected toproduce 95,000 ounces of gold in 1988, plus significantquantities of silver, lead and zinc.    U.S. Minerals said it has a 50 pct net profit royaltyinterest in the mine after payback of development costs. Reuter
