ZINC PRODUCERS APPROACH EC ON VOLUNTARY CLOSURES A number of individual zinc producingcompanies have approached the European Commission to sound outits reaction to a possible industry plan for a voluntaryreduction of smelting capacity, Commission sources said.    The companies have been told that the Commission could notjudge whether a plan would be acceptable under EuropeanCommunity, EC, competition rules until it had full details,they said.    In 1983, the industry drew up a plan envisaging the loss ofabout 130,000 tonnes of annual capacity, or about 10 pct of thetotal.    However, the industry did not proceed with this plan aszinc market conditions improved in 1984, the sources noted.    They said the companies which approached the Commissionrecently -- and which they did not name -- appeared to envisagea loss of productive capacity similar to that proposed in 1983. Reuter

A spokesman for Padaeng Industry Co Ltd, the country's soleexporter, attributed the decline to the company's lower stocks,which averaged 5,000 tonnes in the first quarter against 16,000tonnes in late 1985 when it began exporting.    The department said major buyers included China, Japan, thePhilippines, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.

CONCENTRATION OF ZINC INDUSTRY SEEN CONTINUING The world's zinc mining and smeltingindustry will continue to become more concentrated and moreintegrated in the 1990s, Dr Klaus Goekmann, vice-president ofmarketing and sales for Cominco Ltd, said.    Opening a Metal Bulletin base metals conference here,Goekmann forecast the number of individual businesses in theindustry would continue to decline as companies merged orformed conglomerates with increased market shares.    At the same time, the conglomerates would become moreintegrated, handling the entire chain from basic ore productionthrough marketing, he added.    "The key to future viability will be flexibility. Prices arelikely to remain at current historically low levels at least inthe medium term, and competition with other metals andmaterials will continue to intensify," Goekmann said.    "In the past, we have only reacted to changes in the world'smarket and economics. In the future, we have to act lessdefensively and more aggressively."    The industry also has massive overcapacity and this problemhas to be tackled quickly, he added.    "Attempts in the past to cut out this excess capacity inEurope have all failed miserably. However, there is some hopethat current efforts may be successful," Goekmann said.    At the same time, companies must move to limit theirgeographical and currency risks and become far more marketingorientated, he added.    "With all these changes and rationalization, the industrycan survive to recover its past strength and profitability.Without them, the future does not look very rosy," Goekmannsaid. Reuter
MAJOR EUROPEAN ZINC SMELTER MERGER SEEN BY 1990 There should be at least one mergerbetween major European zinc smelters before the end of thedecade, Christian Bue, Executive Vice President (commercial) ofSMM Penarroya in France, said.    Speaking on the second day of the Metal Bulletin basemetals conference, Bue said he expected the current talksbetween five smelters including Penarroya to result inintegration between at least some of the companies before 1990.    The five companies, SMM Penarroya, Outokumpu Oy, PreussagAg, Ste de la Vieille Montagne and Boliden Ore and Metals AB,have 22 pct of the world market, Bue added.    "We have no alternative than to integrate out businessesinto large trading blocs if we are to survive the cut-throatprice competition and the trend to forward integration from themining companies," Bue said.    "It is by no means certain that all the five companiesinvolved in the talks will integrate together. It is quitelikely, and even preferable, that the European smelters formtwo or three large integrated blocs.    "In this way we will be better able to negotiate with ourconcentrate suppliers on one side, and with the metal buyers onthe other," Bue added.    In the past, production overcapacity and the intensecompetition between the European zinc smelters has meant theyhave not only been in a very weak negotiating position whenbuying concentrates, but in an even weaker one when selling themetal, Bue noted.    Although the apparently easy solution is to simply shutdown excess capacity, the burden of this on individualcompanies is far too heavy and no one can be expected tovolunteer, he added.    Another possible but very risky solution is to investheavily in more modern and lower cost facilities, he said.    "My answer to this suggestion is that individual companieswho do not invest will surely die, and those that do investmight survive, but only might, " Bue said.    "The only real option in my mind is integration,rationalization and stabilization. We have no alternative, " headded.    Bue also said that the European smelters were completelydissatisfied with the tradition of pricing concentrates andmetals in US dollars, and suggested moving either to a basketof the world's major currencies or pricing in European currencyunits (Ecus) to protect against exchange rate volatility.    Bue's views on integration between European smelters weremet by general approval from the conference audience comprisingrepresentatives from many of the world's major mining, smeltingand trading companies, although some of the miningrepresentatives were somewhat sceptical in view of their ownindustry's move towards integration with smelters.    However, some concentrate traders did express worry abouttheir own position if the metals industry does make the move tolarge trading blocs.    The currency basket suggestion cropped up constantly, butfew said they thought matters would change in the near future. REUTER

FORCE MAJEURE LIFTED AT CAJAMARQUILLA Peru's state minerals marketing arm, MineroPeru Comercial SA (Minpeco), lifted a force majeure on zincingot shipments from the country's biggest zinc refinery atCajamarquilla, a spokesman said.    The spokesman said the problems affecting sulphuric acidand roaster plants that had halted production since May 4 hadbeen resolved.    However, he said production of zinc ingots this year wasexpected to fall to around 86,000 tonnes this year atCajamarquilla, from 94,000 tonnes in 1986 because of thestoppage.    The refinery has an optimum annual production capacity of100,000 tonnes but its highest production was 96,000 tonnes ofrefined zinc ingots in 1985, the spokesman said. Reuter
